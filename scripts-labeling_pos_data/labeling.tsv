the drosophila eye, a paradigm for epithelial organization, is highly polarized with mirror-image symmetry about the equator. the r3 and r4 photoreceptors in each ommatidium are vital in this polarity; they adopt asymmetrical positions in adult ommatidia and are the site of action for several essential genes. two such genes are frizzled (fz) and dishevelled (dsh), the products of which are components of a signalling pathway required in r3, and which are thought to be activated by a diffusible signal. here we show that the transmembrane receptor notch is required downstream of dsh in r3/r4 for them to adopt distinct fates. by using an enhancer for the notch target gene enhancer of split mdelta, we show that notch becomes activated specifically in r4. we propose that fz/dsh promotes activity of the notch ligand delta and inhibits notch receptor activity in r3, creating a difference in notch signalling capacity between r3 and r4. subsequent feedback in the notch pathway ensures that this difference becomes amplified. this interplay between fz/dsh and notch indicates that polarity is established through local comparisons between two cells and explains how a signal from one position (for example, the equator in the eye) could be interpreted by all ommatidia in the field.

mitosis in most drosophila cells is triggered by brief bursts of transcription of string (stg), a cdc25-type phosphatase that activates the mitotic kinase, cdk1 (cdc2). to understand how string transcription is regulated, we analyzed the expression of string-lacz reporter genes covering approximately 40 kb of the string locus. we also tested protein coding fragments of the string locus of 6 kb to 31.6 kb for their ability to complement loss of string function in embryos and imaginal discs. a plethora of cis-acting elements spread over >30 kb control string transcription in different cells and tissue types. regulatory elements specific to subsets of epidermal cells, mesoderm, trachea and nurse cells were identified, but the majority of the string locus appears to be devoted to controlling cell proliferation during neurogenesis. consistent with this, compact promotor-proximal sequences are sufficient for string function during imaginal disc growth, but additional distal elements are required for the development of neural structures in the eye, wing, leg and notum. we suggest that, during evolution, cell-type-specific control elements were acquired by a simple growth-regulated promoter as a means of coordinating cell division with developmental processes, particularly neurogenesis.

the drosophila nk-1 homeobox gene belongs to the nk-1 class that includes a large number of vertebrate homeobox genes and is shown to be expressed in specific muscle founder cells and a subset of neuronal cells in the ventral nerve cord during embryogenesis. to determine the cis-acting regulatory elements controlling the cell-specific expression of nk-1, we measured transiently expressed chloramphencol acetyl transferase (cat) reporter gene activities from transfected c2c12 myoblasts and ng108-15 neuroblastoma cells using various cat constructs containing different 5' upstream regions of nk-1. from the initial analysis of 3.9 kb of the 5' upstream region, we have found that the regions from -1865 to -476 and from -476 to +100 contained strong negative and positive regulatory elements, respectively. within the positive cis-acting region an 86-bp dna fragment (from -435 to -350) was sufficient to activate the reporter gene in c2c12 cells, whereas additional regions (from -157 to -28 and from -510 to -425) were required for optimal activity in ng108-15 cells. gel shift and dnasei footprinting assays have defined a plausible binding site for c/ebp, 5'-tttcgcaag-3' (-424 to -416), and a novel binding site for unknown factors, 5'-aattactcacatcc-3' (-370 to -357). further mutation analysis has revealed that the novel binding sequence for unknown factors is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional activity for reporter gene expression in c2c12 myoblast cells in an orientation-independent manner.

the drosophila pax-6 gene eyeless (ey) plays a key role in eye development. here we show tht drosophila contains a second pax-6 gene, twin of eyeless (toy), due to a duplication during insect evolution. toy is more similar to vertebrate pax-6 proteins than ey with regard to overall sequence conservation, dna-binding function, and early expression in the embryo, toy and ey share a similar expression pattern in the developing visual system, and targeted expression of toy, like ey, induces the formation of ectopic eyes. genetic and biochemical evidence indicates, however, that toy functions upstream of ey by directly regulating the eye-specific enhancer of ey. toy is therefore required for initiation of ey expression in the embryo and acts through ey to activate the eye developmental program.

the pax-6 gene encodes a transcription factor with two dna-binding domains, a paired and a homeodomain, and is expressed during eye morphogenesis and development of the nervous system. pax-6 homologs have been isolated from a wide variety of organisms ranging from flatworms to humans. since loss-of-function mutants in insects and mammals lead to an eyeless phenotype and pax-6 orthologs from distantly related species are capable of inducing ectopic eyes in drosophila, we have proposed that pax-6 is a universal master control gene for eye morphogenesis. to determine the extent of evolutionary conservation of the eye morphogenetic pathway, we have begun to identify subordinate target genes of pax-6. previously we have shown that expression of two genes, sine oculis (so) and eyes absent (eya), is induced by eyeless (ey), the pax-6 homolog of drosophila. here we present evidence from ectopic expression studies in transgenic flies, from transcription activation studies in yeast, and from gel shift assays in vitro that the ey protein activates transcription of sine oculis by direct interaction with an eye-specific enhancer in the long intron of the so gene.

the entire functional even-skipped locus of drosophila melanogaster is contained within a 16 kilobase region. as a transgene, this region is capable of rescuing even-skipped mutant flies to fertile adulthood. detailed analysis of the 7.7 kb of regulatory dna 3' of the transcription unit revealed ten novel, independently regulated patterns. most of these patterns are driven by non-overlapping regulatory elements, including ones for syncytial blastoderm stage stripes 1 and 5, while a single element specifies both stripes 4 and 6. expression analysis in gap gene mutants showed that stripe 5 is restricted anteriorly by krüppel and posteriorly by giant, the same repressors that regulate stripe 2. consistent with the coregulation of stripes 4 and 6 by a single cis-element, both the anterior border of stripe 4 and the posterior border of stripe 6 are set by zygotic hunchback, and the region between the two stripes is 'carved out' by knirps. thus the boundaries of stripes 4 and 6 are set through negative regulation by the same gap gene domains that regulate stripes 3 and 7 (small, s., blair, a. and levine, m. (1996) dev. biol. 175, 314-24), but at different concentrations. the 3' region also contains a single element for neurogenic expression in ganglion mother cells 4-2a and 1-1a, and neurons derived from them (rp2, a/pcc), suggesting common regulators in these lineages. in contrast, separable elements were found for expression in el neurons, u/cq neurons and the mesoderm. the even-skipped 3' untranslated region is required to maintain late stage protein expression in rp2 and a/pcc neurons, and appears to affect protein levels rather than mrna levels. additionally, a strong pairing-sensitive repression element was localized to the 3' end of the locus, but was not found to contribute to efficient functional rescue.

background: the structures and functions of promoter sequences of most genes have been analysed using in vitro transcription and/or cultured cell systems, neither possessing tissue-specific enhancers. promoter-enhancer interactions in vivo, in particular, during ontogeny, are still poorly understood. results: we have established a new method for the assessment of promoter activity in cells that participate in fly body formation, using the uas/gal4 system. a functional analysis was then conducted on the promoter sequence of the engrailed gene in drosophila embryos. a 38-bp-long sequence, terminating with an initiator or rna start site and a downstream promoter element, was found to be capable of receiving activation signals from the engrailed stripe enhancer. transcriptional efficiency was improved significantly by the presence of upstream promoting elements, most functionally replaceable with synthetic gaga factor binding sites. conclusions: we identified the in vivo minimum promoter of engrailed and demonstrated that the gaga factor binding sites serve primarily as quantitative elements which augment transcriptional efficiency. evidence was also obtained that indicated that not only enhancer but also promoter sequences were involved in the determination of the tissue-specificity of gene expression.

the derailed (drl) gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) that governs aspects of axon guidance and muscle-epidermal interactions in the drosophila embryo. to determine the types of neurons that express drl, we have examined a series of drl promoter fusions to axon-targeted reporters. we have identified enhancers that drive reporter expression in four distinct subtypes of embryonic neurons, all of which project axons in the anterior commissure of the developing nervous system. we also identified enhancers driving expression in the drl-expressing muscles and epidermal attachment cells. these enhancers define the classes of neurons projecting in the anterior commissure and can be used to precisely define axon pathfinding errors in drl and other mutants.

we have isolated a drosophila receptor protein tyrosine kinase (rtk) of the eph subfamily. dek, for drosophila eph kinase, possesses all the domains characteristic of the eph subfamily of rtks and is equally similar in sequence to both the epha and the ephb subclasses. antibody staining and promoter fusions to axon-targeted reporters reveal that dek is expressed by a large subset of developing embryonic interneurons and is targeted to their axons and growth cones at the time of axon pathfinding. dek is also expressed by photoreceptor cells of third-instar larvae as they project axons into the optic brain lobe. misexpression and overexpression of full-length dek or kinase-inactive dek do not grossly affect axon pathfinding.

during development, global patterning events initiate signal transduction cascades which gradually establish an array of individual cell fates. many of the genes which pattern drosophila are expressed throughout development and specify diverse cell types by creating unique local environments which establish the expression of locally acting genes. this process is exemplified by the patterning of leg microchaete rows. hairy (h) is expressed in a spatially restricted manner in the leg imaginal disc and functions to position adult leg bristle rows by negatively regulating the proneural gene achaete, which specifies sensory cell fates. while much is known about the events that partition the leg imaginal disc and about sensory cell differentiation, the mechanisms that refine early patterning events to the level of individual cell fate specification are not well understood. we have investigated the regulation of h expression along the dorsal/ventral (d/v) axis of the leg adjacent to the anterior/posterior (a/p) compartment boundary and have found that it requires input from both d/v and a/p patterning mechanisms. expression of the d/v axis h stripe (d/v-h) is controlled by dorsal- and ventral-specific enhancer elements which are targets of decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg) signaling, respectively, but which are also dependent on hedgehog (hh) signaling for activation. d/v-h expression is lost in smoothened mutant clones and is specifically activated by exogenously supplied cubitus interruptus (ci). d/v-h expression is also lost in clones deficient for dpp and wg signaling, but ectopic activation of d/v-h by dpp and wg is limited to the a/p compartment boundary where endogenous levels of full-length ci are high. we propose that d/v-h expression is regulated in a non-linear pathway in which ci plays a dual role. in addition to serving as an upstream activator of dpp and wg, ci acts combinatorially with them to activate d/v-h expression.

genetic studies have identified an unusual transvection process in the abdominal-b (abd-b) locus of drosophila. in some cases distal infraabdominal (iab) regulatory domains continue to activate the abd-b promoter even when translocated onto different chromosomes. transvection depends on an approx. 10 kb genomic dna sequence, termed the transvection mediating region (tmr), located immediately downstream of the abd-b transcription unit. here we report a detailed analysis of this region. different dna fragments from the tmr were inserted into a variety of p-transformation vectors. analyses of reporter gene expression in transgenic embryos and adults identify at least three cis-regulatory elements, including two enhancers (iab7 and iab8) and a new insulator dna (frontabdominal-8, fab-8). evidence is also presented for a polycomb response element (pre) linked to the iab8 enhancer, and an internal promoter in the iab-8 domain, which transcribes the iab-7 and iab-8 cis-regulatory dna, including the fab-8 insulator. we discuss the significance of these findings with regard to abd-b transvection and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions in mammalian globin loci.

the chromatin protein polycomb (pc) is necessary for keeping homeotic genes repressed in a permanent and heritable manner. pc is part of a large multimeric complex (pcg proteins) involved in generating silenced chromatin domains at target genes, thus preventing their inappropriate expression. in order to assess the intranuclear distribution of pc during mitosis in different developmental stages as well as in the germ line we generated transgenic fly lines expressing a pc-gfp (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein. rapidly dividing nuclei were found to display a rather homogeneous pc-gfp distribution. however, with increasing differentiation a pronounced subnuclear pattern was observed. in all investigated diploid somatic tissues the bulk of pc-gfp fusion protein is depleted from the chromosomes during mitosis: however, a detectable fraction remains associated. in the male germ line in early spermatogenesis, pc-gfp was closely associated with the chromosomal bivalents and gradually lost at later stages. interestingly, we found that pc is associated with the nucleolus in spermatocytes, unlike somatic nuclei. in contrast to mature sperm showing no pc-gfp signal the female germ line retains pc in the germinal vesicle.

in drosophila, the gata family transcription factor pannier and the wnt secreted protein wingless are known to be important for the patterning of the notum, a part of the dorsal mesothorax of the fly. thus, both proteins are necessary for the development of the dorsocentral mechanosensory bristles, although their roles in this process have not been clarified. here, we show that pannier directly activates the proneural genes achaete and scute by binding to the enhancer responsible for the expression of these genes in the dorsocentral proneural cluster. moreover, the boundary of the expression domain of pannier appears to delimit the proneural cluster laterally, while antagonism of pannier function by the zn-finger protein u-shaped sets its limit dorsally. so, pannier and u-shaped provide positional information for the patterning of the dorsocentral cluster. in contrast and contrary to previous suggestions, wingless does not play a similar role, since the levels and vectorial orientation of its concentration gradient in the dorsocentral area can be greatly modified without affecting the position of the dorsocentral cluster. thus, wingless has only a permissive role on dorsocentral achaete-scute expression. we also provide evidence indicating that pannier and u-shaped are main effectors of the regulation of wingless expression in the presumptive notum.

in drosophila, the imaginal discs are the primordia for adult appendages. their proper formation is dependent upon the activation of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene in a stripe of cells just anterior to the compartment boundary. in imaginal discs, the dpp gene has been shown to be activated by hedgehog signal transduction. however, an initial analysis of its enhancer region suggests that its regulation is complex and depends upon additional factors. in order to understand how multiple factors regulate dpp expression, we chose to focus on a single dpp enhancer element, the dpp heldout enhancer, from the 3' cis regulatory disc region of the dpp locus. in this report, we present a molecular analysis of this 358 bp wing- and haltere-specific dpp enhancer, which demonstrates a direct transcriptional requirement for the cubitus interruptus (ci) protein. the results suggest that, in addition to regulation by ci, expression of the dpp heldout enhancer is spatially determined by drosophila tcf (dtcf) and the vestigial/scalloped selector system and that temporal control is provided by dpp autoregulation. consistent with the unexpectedly complex regulation of the dpp heldout enhancer, analysis of a ci consensus site reporter construct suggests that ci, a mediator of hedgehog transcriptional activation, can only transactivate in concert with other factors.

the ecr/usp nuclear receptor controls drosophila metamorphosis by activating complex cascades of gene transcription in response to pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone at the end of larval development. ecdysone release provides a ubiquitous signal for the activation of the receptor, but a number of its target genes are induced in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in this developmental modulation of the ecr/usp-mediated pathway. fbp1 is a good model of primary ecdysone response gene expressed in the fat body for addressing this question. we show here that the dgatab factor binds to three target sites flanking an ecr/usp binding site in a 70-bp enhancer that controls the tissue and stage specificity of fbp1 transcription. we demonstrate that one of these sites and proper expression of dgatab are required for specific activation of the enhancer in the fat body. in addition, we provide further evidence that ecr/usp plays an essential role as a hormonal timer. our study provides a striking example of the integration of molecular pathways at the level of a tissue-specific hormone response unit.

"division of a female drosophila stem cell produces a daughter stem cell and a cystoblast. the cystoblast produces a syncytial cluster of 16 cells by precisely four mitotic divisions and incomplete cytokinesis. mutations in genes required for cystoblast differentiation, such as bag-of-marbles, block syncytial cluster formation and produce a distinctive ""tumorous"" or hyperplastic germ cell phenotype. in this paper, we compare the oogenic phenotype of benign gonial cell neoplasm mutations to that of mutations in bam. the data indicate that, like bam, bgcn is required for cystoblast development and that germ cells lacking bgcn become trapped in a stem cell-like state. one indication that germ cells lacking bgcn cannot form cystoblasts is that bgcn stem cells resist genetic ablation by bam misexpression. misexpression of bam eliminates wild-type stem cells, apparently by inducing them to divide as cystoblasts. bgcn stem cells remain active when bam is misexpressed, probably because they cannot adopt the cystoblast fate. bgcn activity is not required for bam protein expression but is essential for the localization of bam protein to the fusome. together, the results suggest that bam and bgcn cooperatively regulate cystoblast differentiation by controlling localization of bam protein to the fusome."

in drosophila, genes of the enhancer of split complex [e(spl)-c] are important components of the notch (n) cell-cell signaling pathway, which is utilized in imaginal discs to effect a series of cell fate decisions during adult peripheral nervous system development. seven genes in the complex encode basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcriptional repressors, while 4 others encode members of the bearded family of small proteins. a striking diversity is observed in the imaginal disc expression patterns of the various e(spl)-c genes, suggestive of a diversity of function, but the mechanistic basis of this variety has not been elucidated. here we present strong evidence from promoter-reporter transgene experiments that regulation at the transcriptional level is primarily responsible. certain e(spl)-c genes were known previously to be direct targets of transcriptional activation both by the n-signal-dependent activator suppressor of hairless [su(h)] and by the proneural bhlh proteins achaete and scute. our extensive sequence analysis of the promoter-proximal upstream regions of 12 transcription units in the e(spl)-c reveals that such dual transcriptional activation is likely to be the rule for at least 10 of the 12 genes. we next show that the very different wing imaginal disc expression patterns of e(spl)m4 and e(spl)mgamma are a property of small (200-300 bp), evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer elements, which can confer these distinct patterns on a heterologous promoter despite their considerable structural similarity [each having three su(h) and two proneural protein binding sites]. we also demonstrate that the characteristic inactivity of the e(spl)mgamma enhancer in the notum and margin territories of the wing disc can be overcome by elevated activity of the n receptor. we conclude that the distinctive expression patterns of e(spl)-c genes in imaginal tissues depend to a significant degree on the capacity of their transcriptional cis-regulatory apparatus to respond selectively to direct proneural- and su(h)-mediated activation, often in only a subset of the territories and cells in which these modes of regulation are operative.

drosophila melanogaster has two na(+),k(+)-atpase beta subunit genes (nervana 1 and 2; nrv), with tissue-specific expression patterns. nrv1 produces a single beta subunit isoform expressed primarily in muscle tissue, whereas nrv2 codes for two different isoforms (2.1 and 2.2) expressed in the nervous system. we have determined the complete molecular genomic organization for both nrv genes. only 3kb of dna separate the 3' end of nrv2 from nrv1. the cdnas from all three forms of nrv have been mapped onto the genomic structure and all intron-exon junctions have been confirmed by direct sequencing. the genomic dna positioned in the 5' flanking region of each nrv gene has also been tested for tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory activity. p-element transformation vectors were constructed, which contained either 7.7kb of nrv2 or 3.5kb nrv1 5' flanking dna driving expression of a lacz reporter gene. multiple transgenic drosophila lines were established for each construct and analyzed for their beta-galactosidase expression pattern. the tissue-specific expression of each nrv gene is independently regulated by the cis-element(s) present in the 5' flanking region. the nrv2 5' flanking dna directs expression exclusively to the nervous system, whereas nrv1 5' flanking dna directs expression primarily in muscle tissue.

in the drosophila embryo, a distinct class of myoblasts, designated as muscle founders, prefigures the mature pattern of somatic body wall muscles. each founder cell appears to be instrumental in generating a single larval muscle with a defined identity. the nk homeobox gene s59 was the first of a growing number of proposed 'identity genes' that have been found to be expressed in stereotyped patterns in specific subsets of muscle founders and their progenitor cells and are thought to control their developmental fates. in the present study, we describe the effects of gain- and loss-of-function experiments with s59. we find that a null mutation in the gene encoding s59, which we have named slouch (slou), disrupts the development of all muscles that are derived from s59-expressing founder cells. the observed phenotypes upon mutation and ectopic expression of slouch include transformations of founder cell fates, thus confirming that slouch (s59) functions as an identity gene in muscle development. these fate transformations occur between sibling founder cells as well as between neighboring founders that are not lineage-related. in the latter case, we show that slouch (s59) activity is required cell-autonomously to repress the expression of ladybird (lb) homeobox genes, thereby preventing specification along the lb pathway. together, these findings provide new insights into the regulatory interactions that establish the somatic muscle pattern.

the drosophila melanogaster gene sgs-1 belongs to the secretion protein genes, which are coordinately expressed in salivary glands of third instar larvae. earlier analysis had implied that sgs-1 is located at the 25b2-3 puff. we cloned sgs-1 from a yac covering 25b2-3. despite using a variety of vectors and escherichia coli strains, subcloning from the yac led to deletions within the sgs-1 coding region. analysis of clonable and unclonable sequences revealed that sgs-1 mainly consists of 48-bp tandem repeats encoding a threonine-rich protein. the sgs-1 inserts from single lambda clones are heterogeneous in length, indicating that repeats are eliminated. by analyzing the expression of sgs-1/lacz fusions in transgenic flies, cis-regulatory elements of sgs-1 were mapped to lie within 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. band shift assays revealed binding sites for the transcription factor fork head (fkh) and the factor secretion enhancer binding protein 3 (sebp3) at positions that are functionally relevant. fkh and sebp3 have been shown previously to be involved in the regulation of sgs-3 and sgs-4. comparison of the levels of steady state rna and of the transcription rates for sgs-1 and sgs-1/lacz reporter genes indicates that sgs-1 rna is 100-fold more stable than sgs-1/lacz rna. this has implications for the model of how sgs transcripts accumulate in late third instar larvae.

the zinc finger transcription factors spalt and spalt-related have been implicated in multiple developmental processes. in the wing they are regulated by the secreted protein decapentaplegic and participate in the positioning of the wing veins. the function of spalt has been also analyzed during tracheal development and embryonic segmentation. here, we present the isolation and characterization of novel spalt/spalt-related alleles, which analysis indicates that these genes cannot substitute for each other in the developmental processes studied. the mutants present embryonic or pupal lethality, with phenotypes consistent with the loss of spalt function. we also present a detailed functional analysis of the dna regions implicated in the regulation of these genes. this regulation is complex, integrating the information from both negative and positive regulators, and it is modular, with discrete fragments of dna directing expression to discrete regions in embryonic and larval tissues.

the mads-box transcription factor mef2 is expressed specifically in developing cardiac, somatic, and visceral muscle cell lineages during drosophila embryogenesis and is required for myoblast differentiation and muscle morphogenesis. to define the mechanisms that regulate mef2 transcription, we have analyzed the mef2 upstream region for sequences sufficient to recapitulate the expression pattern of the gene in drosophila embryos. here we describe a complex enhancer located 5.8 kb upstream of the drosophila mef2 gene that controls transcription in cardial cells of the dorsal vessel, a subset of somatic muscle founder cells, and the visceral muscle cells. the core of this enhancer contains two evolutionarily conserved binding sites for the homeodomain protein tinman (tin), expressed in developing cardiac, somatic, and visceral muscle lineages. both tin binding sites are required for enhancer activity in all three muscle cell lineages. whereas the 285-bp enhancer core alone is sufficient for expression in cardiac cells, expression in somatic founder cells and visceral muscle is dependent on the core enhancer plus unique flanking sequences that include an evolutionarily conserved e box. these results reveal an essential role for tin in activation of mef2 transcription in multiple myogenic lineages and demonstrate that transcriptional activity of tin is dependent on combinatorial interactions with other factors unique to different muscle cell types.

the regulation of cardiac gene expression by gata zinc finger transcription factors is well documented in vertebrates. however, genetic studies in mice have failed to demonstrate a function for these proteins in cardiomyocyte specification. in drosophila, the existence of a cardiogenic gata factor has been implicated through the analysis of a cardial cell enhancer of the muscle differentiation gene d-mef2. we show that the gata gene pannier is expressed in the dorsal mesoderm and required for cardial cell formation while repressing a pericardial cell fate. ectopic expression of pannier results in cardial cell overproduction, while co-expression of pannier and the homeodomain protein tinman synergistically activate cardiac gene expression and induce cardial cells. the related gata4 protein of mice likewise functions as a cardiogenic factor in drosophila, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved function between pannier and gata4 in heart development.

during drosophila embryogenesis, the beta3 tubulin gene is expressed in the visceral and somatic mesoderm as well as in the dorsal vessel. transcription of the gene is limited to four pairs of cardioblasts per segment. here we show that its expression in the dorsal vessel (dv) is mediated by a 333-bp enhancer located upstream of the gene. the homeodomain protein tinman is also expressed in these cardioblasts, implying that tinman might be a key regulator of the beta3 tubulin gene. gel retardation and footprint assays indeed revealed two tinman binding sites within the dv-specific enhancer. we analyzed the relevance of the tinman binding sites in a transgenic fly assay and observed distinct functions for both sites. the bs(tin-1460) site is absolutely required for expression in cardioblasts, while bs(tin-1425) is needed for high-level expression. thus, these two tinman binding sites act in concert to drive beta3 tubulin gene expression during heart development. tinman initially functions in the specification of visceral mesoderm and heart progenitors, but remains expressed in cardioblasts until dorsal closure. overall, our data demonstrate a late function for tinman in the regulation of beta3 tubulin gene expression in the forming heart of drosophila.

we identified a novel regulatory loop within drosophila's circadian clock. a screen for clock-controlled genes recovered vrille (vri), a transcription factor essential for embryonic development. vri is expressed in circadian pacemaker cells in larval and adult brains. vri rna levels oscillate with a circadian rhythm. cycling is directly regulated by the transcription factors dclock and cycle, which are also required for oscillations of period and timeless rna. eliminating the normal vri cycle suppresses period and timeless expression and causes long-period behavioral rhythms and arrhythmicity, indicating that cycling vri is required for a functional drosophila clock. we also show that dclock and vri independently regulate levels of a neuropeptide, pigment dispersing factor, which appears to regulate overt behavior.

the mechanisms by which circadian pacemaker systems transmit timing information to control behavior are largely unknown. here, we define two critical features of that mechanism in drosophila. we first describe animals mutant for the pdf neuropeptide gene, which is expressed by most of the candidate pacemakers (lnv neurons). next, we describe animals in which pdf neurons were selectively ablated. both sets of animals produced similar behavioral phenotypes. both sets entrained to light, but both were largely arrhythmic under constant conditions. a minority of each pdf variant exhibited weak to moderate free-running rhythmicity. these results confirm the assignment of lnv neurons as the principal circadian pacemakers controlling daily locomotion in drosophila. they also implicate pdf as the principal circadian transmitter.

salivary gland formation in the drosophila embryo is dependent on the homeotic gene sex combs reduced (scr). when scr function is missing, salivary glands do not form, and when scr is expressed everywhere in the embryo, salivary glands form in new places. scr is normally expressed in all the cells that form the salivary gland. however, as the salivary gland invaginates, scr mrna and protein disappear. homeotic genes, such as scr, specify tissue identity by regulating the expression of downstream target genes. for many homeotic proteins, target gene specificity is achieved by cooperatively binding dna with cofactors. therefore, it is likely that scr also requires a cofactor(s) to specifically bind to dna and regulate salivary gland target gene expression. here, we show that two homeodomain-containing proteins encoded by the extradenticle (exd) and homothorax (hth) genes are also required for salivary gland formation. exd and hth function at two levels: (1) exd and hth are required to maintain the expression of scr in the salivary gland primordia prior to invagination and (2) exd and hth are required in parallel with scr to regulate the expression of downstream salivary gland genes. we also show that scr regulates the nuclear localization of exd in the salivary gland primordia through repression of homothorax (hth) expression, linking the regulation of scr activity to the disappearance of scr expression in invaginating salivary glands.

the beta3 tubulin gene of drosophila is expressed in the major mesodermal derivatives during their differentiation. the gene is subject to complex stage- and tissue-specific transcriptional control by upstream as well as downstream regions. analysis of the vm1 enhancer, which is responsible for tissue-specific expression in the visceral mesoderm and is localized in the intron, revealed a complex modular arrangement of regulatory elements. in vitro and in vivo experiments uncovered two binding sites, termed ubx1 and ubx2, for the product of the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx), which are required for high-level expression in pps6 and ps7. further analysis of the vm1 enhancer revealed that deletion of a specific element, termed element 7 (e7), abolishes transcription of the lacz reporter gene in all parasegments except pps6/ps7. gel-retardation and footprint analysis identified a binding site for the homeodomain protein tinman, which is essential for the specification of the dorsal mesoderm, within e7. simultaneous deletion of two further sequence blocks in the vml enhancer, named elements 3 (e3), and 6 (e6), results in a reduction analogous to that caused by removal of e7. the e6 sequence contains conserved motifs also found in the visceral enhancer of the ubx gene. therefore we conclude that these elements act in concert with the tinman binding site to achieve high expression levels. thus the vm1 enhancer of the beta3 tubulin gene contains a complex array of elements that are involved in transactivation by a combination of tissue- and position-specific factors including tinman and ubx.

the eyes absent (eya) gene is critical for normal eye development in drosophila and is highly conserved to vertebrates. to define regions of the gene critical for eye function, we have defined the mutations in the four viable eya alleles. two of these mutations are eye specific and undergo transvection with other mutations in the gene. these were found to be deletion mutations that remove regulatory sequence critical for eye cell expression of the gene. two other viable alleles cause a reduced eye phenotype and affect the function of the gene in additional tissues, such as the ocelli. these mutations were found to be insertion mutations of different transposable elements within the 5' utr of the transcript. detailed analysis of one of these revealed that the transposable element has become subject to regulation by eye enhancer sequences of the eya gene, disrupting normal expression of eya in the eye. more extended analysis of the deletion region in the eye-specific alleles indicated that the deleted region defines an enhancer that activates gene expression in eye progenitor cells. this enhancer is responsive to ectopic expression of the eyeless gene. this analysis has defined a critical regulatory region required for proper eye expression of the eya gene.

spatial boundaries of homeotic gene expression are initiated and maintained by two sets of transcriptional repressors: the gap gene products and the polycomb group proteins. previously, the hunchback (hb) protein has been implicated in setting the anterior expression limit of the ubx homeotic protein in parasegment 6. here we investigate dna elements and trans-acting repressors that control spatial expression of the abdominal-a (abd-a) homeotic protein. analysis of a 1.7-kb enhancer element [iab-2(1.7)] from the iab-2 regulatory region shows that in contrast to ubx enhancer elements, both hb and krüppel (kr) are required to set the abd-a anterior boundary in parasegment 7. dnase i footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis show that hb and kr are direct regulators of this iab-2 enhancer. the single kr site can be moved to a new location 100 bp away and still maintain repressive activity, whereas relocation by 300 bp abolishes activity. these results suggest that kr repression occurs through a local quenching mechanism. we also show that the gap repressor giant (gt) initially establishes a posterior expression limit at ps9, which shifts posteriorly after the blastoderm stage. finally, we show that this iab-2 enhancer contains multiple binding sites for the polycomb group protein pleiohomeotic (pho). these iab-2 pho sites are required in vivo for chromosome pairing-dependent repression of a mini-white reporter. however, the pho sites are not sufficient to maintain repression of a homeotic reporter gene anterior to ps7. full maintenance at late embryonic stages requires additional sequences adjacent to the iab-2(1.7) enhancer.

transcriptional control of the drosophila terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) depends on torso (tor) receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) signaling and the rel/nfkappab homolog dorsal (di). di acts as an intrinsic transcriptional activator in the ventral region of the embryo, but under certain conditions, such as when it is associated with the non-dna-binding co-repressor groucho (gro), it is converted into a repressor. gro is recruited to the enhancer element in the vicinity of di by sequence-specific transcription factors such as dead ringer (dri). we examined the interplay between di, gro and dri on the hkb enhancer and show that when acting over a distance, gro abolishes rather than converts di activator function. reducing the distance between di- and dri-binding sites, however, switches di into a gro-dependent repressor that overrides activation of transcription. both of the distance-dependent regulatory options of gro - quenching and silencing of transcription - are inhibited by rtk signaling. these data describe a newly identified mode of function for gro when acting in concert with di. rtk signaling provides a way of modulating di function by interfering either with gro activity or with dri-dependent recruitment of gro to the enhancer.

the drosophila homeobox gene tinman plays a critical role in subdividing the early mesoderm. in particular, tinman is absolutely required for formation of the heart and visceral mesoderm. tinman expression is initiated throughout the mesoderm of the trunk region under the control of the bhlh transcription factor encoded by the twist gene, a determinant of all mesoderm. later, tinman expression is restricted to the dorsal portion of the mesoderm, a process that is directed by decapentaplegic (dpp) whose product (a tgf-beta-related protein) is secreted by the overlaying ectoderm. further restriction of tinman expression to the cardiac progenitors, in which it will persist throughout development, involves the secreted segmentation gene product encoded by wingless (wg, a drosophila wnt gene). here, we show that strong early expression depends on the synergistic action of an enhancer element at the 5' end of the gene in conjunction with an element in the first intron. moreover, two distinct enhancer regions are responsible for tinman expression in the heart: one region confers expression in the heart-tube-associated pericardial cells, the other element drives expression in the contractile, myocardial cells. the latter element contains two creb consensus binding sites that are essential for cardiac-specific expression. genesis 26:55-66, 2000.

notch signal transduction appears to involve the ligand-induced intracellular processing of notch, and the formation of a processed notch-suppressor of hairless complex that binds dna and activates the transcription of notch target genes. this suggests that loss of either notch or su(h) activities should lead to similar cell fate changes. however, previous data indicate that, in the drosophila blastoderm embryo, mesectoderm specification requires notch but not su(h) activity. the determination of the mesectodermal fate is specified by single-minded (sim), a transcription factor expressed in a single row of cells abutting the mesoderm. the molecular mechanisms by which the dorsoventral gradient of nuclear dorsal establishes the single-cell wide territory of sim expression are not fully understood. we have found that notch activity is required for sim expression in cellularizing embryos. in contrast, at this stage, su(h) has a dual function. su(h) activity was required to up-regulate sim expression in the mesectoderm, and to prevent the ectopic expression of sim dorsally in the neuroectoderm. we have shown that repression of sim transcription by su(h) is direct and independent of notch activity. conversely, activation of sim transcription by notch requires the su(h)-binding sites. thus, notch signalling appears to relieve the repression exerted by su(h) and to up-regulate sim transcription in the mesectoderm. we propose a model in which repression by su(h) and derepression by notch are essential to allow for the definition of a single row of mesectodermal cells in the blastoderm embryo.

bhlh-pas proteins represent a class of transcription factors involved in diverse biological activities. previous experiments demonstrated that the pas domain confers target specificity (zelzer et al., 1997. genes dev. 11, 2079-2089). this suggested an association between the pas domain and additional dna-binding proteins, which is essential for the induction of specific target genes. a candidate for interaction with trh is drifter/ventral veinless, a pou-domain protein. a dual requirement for trh and drifter was identified for the autoregulation of trh and drifter expression. furthermore, ectopic expression of both trh and dfr (but not each one alone) triggered trh autoregulation in several embryonic tissues. a direct interaction between drifter and trh proteins, mediated by the pas domain of trh and the pou domain of drifter, was demonstrated.

in drosophila lateral glial cell development is initiated by the transcription factor encoded by glial cells missing. glial cells missing activates downstream transcription factors such as repo and pointed which subsequently control terminal glial differentiation. the gene loco has been identified as a potential target gene of pointed and is involved in terminal glial differentiation. it encodes an rgs domain protein expressed specifically by the lateral glial cells in the developing embryonic cns. here we analyzed the loco promoter and the control of the glial-specific transcription pattern. using promoter-reporter gene fusions we identified a 1.9 kb promoter element capable of directing the almost complete loco gene expression pattern. sequence analysis suggested the presence of gcm and pointed dna binding sites. following in vitro mutagenesis of these sites we demonstrated their relevance in vivo. the expression of loco is initially dependent on gcm. during subsequent stages of embryonic development gcm and pointed appear to activate loco transcription synergistically. in addition, at least two other factors appear to repress loco expression in the ectoderm and in the cns midline cells.

during the development of the adult central nervous system (cns) of the fruitfly drosophila melanogaster, the a-isoform of the ecdysone receptor (ecr-a), a typical nuclear hormone receptor, is expressed at high levels in the type ii neurons, a set of neurons that die shortly after the emergence of the adult. to understand the role that transcriptional regulation of nuclear receptor genes plays in cns development, we have dissected the region controlling the transcription of ecr-a by analyzing the ability of this region to drive the expression of reporter genes in transgenic animals. these analyses have demonstrated that the type ii neurons are a heterogeneous collection of neurons that utilize different regulatory elements to coordinate the expression of the same transcript.

regulation of the drosophila pigment-dispersing factor (pdf) gene products was analyzed in wild-type and clock mutants. mutations in the transcription factors clock and cycle severely diminish pdf rna and neuropeptide (pdf) levels in a single cluster of clock-gene-expressing brain cells, called small ventrolateral neurons (s-ln(v)s). this clock-gene regulation of specific cells does not operate through an e-box found within pdf regulatory sequences. pdf immunoreactivity exhibits daily cycling, but only within terminals of axons projecting from the s-ln(v)s. this posttranslational rhythm is eliminated by period or timeless null mutations, which do not affect pdf staining in cell bodies or pdf mrna levels. therefore, within these chronobiologically important neurons, separate elements of the central pacemaking machinery regulate pdf or its product in novel and different ways. coupled with contemporary results showing a pdf-null mutant to be severely defective in its behavioral rhythmicity, the present results reveal pdf as an important circadian mediator whose expression and function are downstream of the clockworks.

sox domain proteins encompass a conserved family of transcriptional regulators that are implicated in a variety of developmental processes in eukaryotes from worm to man. the dichaete gene of drosophila encodes a group b sox protein related to mammalian sox1, -2, and -3 and, like these proteins, it is widely and dynamically expressed throughout embryogenesis. in order to unravel new dichaete functions, we characterized the organization of the dichaete gene using a combination of regulatory mutant alleles and reporter gene constructs. dichaete expression is tightly controlled during embryonic development by a complex of regulatory elements distributed over 25 kb downstream and 3 kb upstream of the transcription unit. a series of regulatory alleles which affect tissue-specific domains of dichaete were used to demonstrate that dichaete has functions in addition to those during segmentation and midline development previously described. first, dichaete has functions in the developing brain. a specific group of neural cells in the tritocerebrum fails to develop correctly in the absence of dichaete, as revealed by reduced expression of labial, zfh-2, wingless, and engrailed. second, dichaete is required for the correct differentiation of the hindgut. the dichaete requirement in hindgut morphogenesis is, in part, via regulation of dpp, since ectopically supplied dpp can rescue dichaete phenotypes in the hindgut. taken together, there are now four distinct in vivo functions described for dichaete that can be used as models for context-dependent comparative studies of sox function.

the drosophila raf (d-raf) gene promoter contains a recognition consensus sequence for drosophila stat (d-stat). by band mobility shift assay, we detected a factor binding to the d-stat-recognition sequence in extracts of cultured drosophila cells treated with vanadate peroxide. uv-cross-linking analyses suggested the size of the binding factor to be almost same as that of d-stat. furthermore, the binding activity was increased in cells cotransfected with hop and d-stat expression plasmids. these results strongly suggest that d-stat binds to the d-stat recognition sequence in the d-raf gene promoter. transient luciferase expression assay using schneider 2 cells indicated that the d-raf gene promoter is activated by d-stat through the d-stat-binding site. furthermore, analyses with transgenic flies carrying draf-lacz fusion genes with and without mutations in the d-stat-binding site pointed to an important role in d-raf gene promoter activity throughout development. we also found that the d-stat-binding site is required for injury-induced activation of the d-raf gene promoter. here we propose that d-stat can participate in regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade through d-raf gene activation.

drosophila atonal (ato) is the proneural gene of the chordotonal organs (chos) in the peripheral nervous system (pns) and the larval and adult photoreceptor organs. here, we show that ato is expressed at multiple stages during the development of a lineage of central brain neurons that innervate the optic lobes and are required for eclosion. a novel fate mapping approach shows that ato is expressed in the embryonic precursors of these neurons and that its expression is reactivated in third instar larvae (l3). in contrast to its function in the pns, ato does not act as a proneural gene in the embryonic brain. instead, ato performs a novel function, regulating arborization during larval and pupal development by interacting with notch.

the tumor suppressor gene p53 regulates multiple cellular responses to dna damage, but the transcriptional targets that specify these responses are incompletely understood. we describe a drosophila p53 homolog and demonstrate that it can activate transcription from a promoter containing binding sites for human p53. dominant-negative forms of drosophila p53 inhibit both transactivation in cultured cells and radiation-induced apoptosis in developing tissues. the cis-regulatory region of the proapoptotic gene reaper contains a radiation-inducible enhancer that includes a consensus p53 binding site. drosophila p53 can activate transcription from this site in yeast and a multimer of this site is sufficient for radiation induction in vivo. these results indicate that reaper is a direct transcriptional target of drosophila p53 following dna damage.

expression of the drosophila enhancer of split [e(spl)] genes, and their homologues in other species, is dependent on notch activation. the seven e(spl) genes are clustered in a single complex and their functions overlap significantly; however, the individual genes have distinct patterns of expression. to investigate how this regulation is achieved and to find out whether there is shared or cross regulation between e(spl) genes, we have analysed the enhancer activity of sequences from the adjacent e(spl)mbeta, e(spl)mgamma and e(spl)mdelta genes and made comparisons to e(spl)m8. we find that although regulatory elements can be shared, most aspects of the expression of each individual gene are recapitulated by small (400-500 bp) evolutionarily conserved enhancers. activated notch or a suppressor of hairless-vp16 fusion are only sufficient to elicit transcription from the e(spl) enhancers in a subset of locations, indicating a requirement for other factors. in tissue culture cells, proneural proteins synergise with suppressor of hairless and notch to promote expression from e(spl)mgamma and e(spl)m8, but this synergy is only observed in vivo with e(spl)m8. we conclude that additional factors besides the proneural proteins limit the response of e(spl)mgamma in vivo. in contrast to the other genes, e(spl)mbeta exhibits little response to proneural proteins and its high level of activity in the wing imaginal disc suggests that wing-specific factors cooperate with notch to activate the e(spl)mbeta enhancer. these results demonstrate that notch activity must be integrated with other transcriptional regulators and, since the activation of target genes is critical in determining the developmental consequences of notch activity, provide a framework for understanding notch function in different developmental contexts.

the tata-binding protein (tbp)-related factor 1 (trf1) is expressed in a tissue-restricted fashion during drosophila embryogenesis and may serve as a promoter-specific recognition factor that can replace tbp in regulating transcription. however, bona fide target promoters that would preferentially respond to trf1 have remained elusive. polytene chromosome staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation, direct messenger rna analysis, and transient cotransfection assays identified the drosophila gene tudor as containing a trf1-responsive promoter. reconstituted in vitro transcription reactions and deoxyribonuclease i footprinting assays confirmed the ability of trf1 to bind preferentially and direct transcription of the tudor gene from an alternate promoter. thus, metazoans appear to have evolved gene-selective and tissue-specific components of the core transcription machinery to regulate gene expression.

cry (cryptochrome) is an important clock gene, and recent data indicate that it encodes a critical circadian photoreceptor in drosophila. a mutant allele, cry(b), inhibits circadian photoresponses. restricting cry expression to specific fly tissues shows that cry expression is needed in a cell-autonomous fashion for oscillators present in different locations. cry overexpression in brain pacemaker cells increases behavioral photosensitivity, and this restricted cry expression also rescues all circadian defects of cry(b) behavior. as wild-type pacemaker neurons express cry, the results indicate that they make a striking contribution to all aspects of behavioral circadian rhythms and are directly light responsive. these brain neurons therefore contain an identified deep brain photoreceptor, as well as the other circadian elements: a central pace-maker and a behavioral output system.

the drosophila gli homolog cubitus interruptus (ci) controls the transcription of hedgehog (hh) target genes. a repressor form of ci arises in the absence of hh signalling by proteolytic cleavage of intact ci, whereas an activator form of ci is generated in response to the hh signal. these different activities of ci regulate overlapping but distinct subsets of hh target genes. to investigate the mechanisms by which the two activities of ci exert their opposite transcriptional effect, we dissect here the imaginal disc enhancer of the dpp gene, which responds to both activities of ci. within a minimal disc enhancer, we identify the dna sequences that are necessary and sufficient for the control by ci, show that the same sequences respond to the activator and repressor forms of ci, and demonstrate that their activities can be replaced by a single synthetic gli-binding site. we further show that the enhancer sequences of patched, a gene responding only to the activator form of ci, effectively integrate also the repressor activity of ci if placed into a dpp context. these results provide in vivo evidence against the employment of distinct binding sites for the different forms of ci and suggest that target genes responding to only one form must have acquired distant cis-regulatory elements for their selective behavior.

the steroid hormone ecdysone signals the stage-specific programmed cell death of the larval salivary glands during drosophila metamorphosis. this response is preceded by an ecdysone-triggered switch in gene expression in which the diap2 death inhibitor is repressed and the reaper (rpr) and head involution defective (hid) death activators are induced. here we show that rpr is induced directly by the ecdysone-receptor complex through an essential response element in the rpr promoter. the broad-complex (br-c) is required for both rpr and hid transcription, while e74a is required for maximal levels of hid induction. diap2 induction is dependent on betaftz-f1, while e75a and e75b are each sufficient to repress diap2. this study identifies transcriptional regulators of programmed cell death in drosophila and provides a direct link between a steroid signal and a programmed cell death response.

the early expression of the drosophila segment polarity gene gooseberry (gsb) is under the control of the pair-rule genes. we have identified a 514-bp enhancer which reproduces the early gsb expression pattern in transgenic flies. the transcription factor paired (prd) is the main activator of this enhancer in all parasegments of the embryo. it binds to paired- and homeodomain-binding sites, which are segregated on the enhancer. using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified sites critical for prd activity. negative regulation of this enhancer is mediated by the even-skipped protein (eve) in the odd-numbered parasegments and by the combination of fushi-tarazu (ftz) and odd-skipped proteins in the even-numbered parasegments. the organisation of the prd-binding sites, as well as the necessity for intact dna binding sites for both paired- and homeodomains, suggests a molecular model whereby the two dna-binding domains of the prd protein cooperate in transcriptional activation of gsb. this positive activity appears to be in competition with eve and ftz on prd homeodomain-binding sites.

during drosophila development, transcriptional activation of genes of the enhancer of split complex (e(spl)-c) is a major response to cell-cell signaling via the notch (n) receptor. although the structure and function of the e(spl)-c have been studied intensively during the past decade, these efforts have focused heavily on seven transcription units that encode basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) repressors; the non-bhlh members of the complex have received comparatively little attention. in this report, we analyze the structure, regulation and activity of the m1, m2 and m6 genes of the e(spl)-c. we find that e(spl)m2 and e(spl)m6 encode divergent members of the bearded (brd) family of proteins, bringing to four (m(alpha), m2, m4 and m6) the number of brd family genes in the e(spl)-c. we demonstrate that the expression of both m2 and m6 is responsive to n receptor activity and that both genes are apparently direct targets of regulation by the n-activated transcription factor suppressor of hairless. consistent with this, both are expressed specifically in multiple settings where n signaling takes place. particularly noteworthy is our finding that m6 transcripts accumulate both in adult muscle founder cells in the embryo and in a subset of adepithelial (muscle precursor) cells associated with the wing imaginal disc. we show that overexpression of either m2 or m6 interferes with n-dependent cell fate decisions in adult pns development. surprisingly, while misexpression of m6 impairs lateral inhibition, overexpression of m2 potentiates it, suggesting functional diversification within the brd protein family. finally, we present our initial studies of the structure, expression and regulation of the newest member of the brd gene family, ocho, which is located in the recently identified bearded complex.

candidate drosophila olfactory receptors (ors) provide molecular tools to investigate how the organization of the drosophila olfactory system determines the coding of olfactory stimuli. neurons in the third antennal segment and maxillary palp appear to express different ors. individual olfactory neurons send axonal projections to glomeruli in the antennal lobe. using transgenic flies, we provide evidence that the neurons expressing a given or gene, which have cell bodies distributed among neurons expressing other ors, converge in their projections to topographically fixed glomeruli in the antennal lobe. this convergence allows for the formation of an odotopic map in the antennal lobe whose organization could provide a basis for olfactory discrimination in drosophila.

transcription factors are often expressed at several times and in multiple tissues during development and regulate diverse sets of downstream target genes by varying their combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors. the drosophila tropomyosin i (tmi) gene is regulated by a complex of proteins within the enhancer that synergistically interacts with mef2 to activate tmi transcription as muscle cells fuse and differentiate. one of the components of this complex is pdp1 (par domain protein 1), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is highly homologous to three vertebrate genes that are members of the par domain subfamily. we have isolated and describe here the structure of the pdp1 gene. the pdp1 gene is complex, containing at least four transcriptional start sites and producing at least six different mrnas and pdp1 isoforms. five of the pdp1 isoforms differ by the substitution or insertion of amino acids at or near the n-terminal of the protein. at least three of these alternately spliced transcripts are differentially expressed in different tissues of the developing embryo in which pdp1 expression is correlated with the differentiation of different cell types. a sixth isoform is produced by splicing out part of the par and basic dna binding domains, and dna binding and transient transfection experiments suggest that it functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of transcription. furthermore, two enhancers have been identified within the gene that express in the somatic mesodermal precursors to body wall muscles and fat body and together direct expression in other tissues that closely mimics that of the endogenous gene. these results show that pdp1 is widely expressed, including in muscle, fat, and gut precursors, and is likely involved in the transcriptional control of different developmental pathways through the use of differentially expressed pdp1 isoforms. furthermore, the similarities between pdp1 and the other par domain genes suggest that pdp1 is the homologue of the vertebrate genes.

"we have isolated the ""complete"" repertoire of genes encoding the odorant receptors in drosophila and employ these genes to provide a molecular description of the organization of the peripheral olfactory system. the repertoire of drosophila odorant receptors is encoded by 57 genes. individual sensory neurons are likely to express only a single receptor gene. neurons expressing a given gene project axons to one or two spatially invariant glomeruli in the antennal lobe. the insect brain therefore retains a two-dimensional map of receptor activation such that the quality of an odor may be encoded by different spatial patterns of activity in the antennal lobe."

body structures of drosophila develop through transient developmental units, termed parasegments, with boundaries lying between the adjacent expression domains of wingless and engrailed. parasegments are transformed into the morphologically distinct segments that remain fixed. segment borders are established adjacent and posterior to each engrailed domain. they are marked by single rows of stripe expressing cells that develop into epidermal muscle attachment sites. we show that the positioning of these cells is achieved through repression of hedgehog signal transduction by wingless signaling at the parasegment boundary. the nuclear mediators of the two signaling pathways, cubitus interruptus and pangolin, function as activator and symmetry-breaking repressor of stripe expression, respectively.

homeotic genes of drosophila melanogaster encode transcription factors that specify segment identity by activating the appropriate set of target genes required to produce segment-specific characteristics. advances in understanding target gene selection have been hampered by the lack of genes known to be directly regulated by the hom-c proteins. here we present evidence that the gene 1.28 is likely to be a direct target of deformed in the maxillary segment. we identified a 664-bp deformed response element (1.28 dre) that directs maxillary-specific expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos. the 1.28 dre contains in vitro binding sites for deformed and deaf-1. the deformed binding sites do not have the consensus sequence for cooperative binding with the cofactor extradenticle, and we do not detect cooperative binding to these sites, though we cannot rule out an independent role for extradenticle. removing the four deformed binding sites renders the 1.28 dre inactive in vivo, demonstrating that these sites are necessary for activation of this enhancer element, and supporting the proposition that 1.28 is activated by deformed. we show that the deaf-1 binding region is not required for enhancer function. comparisons of the 1.28 dre with other known deformed-responsive enhancers indicate that there are multiple ways to construct deformed response elements.

although often viewed as a simple pulsating tube, the drosophila dorsal vessel is intricate in terms of its structure, cell types, and patterns of gene expression. two nonidentical groups of cardial cells are observed in segments of the heart based on the differential expression of transcriptional regulators. these include sets of four cell pairs that express the homeodomain protein tinman (tin), alternating with groups of two cell pairs that express the orphan steroid hormone receptor seven up (svp). here we show that these myocardial cell populations are distinct in terms of their formation and gene expression profiles. the svp-expressing cells are generated by asymmetric cell divisions of precursor cells based on decreases or increases in their numbers in numb or sanpodo mutant embryos. in contrast, the numbers of tin-expressing cardial cells are unchanged in these genetic backgrounds, suggesting they arise from symmetric cell divisions. one function for svp in the two pairs of cardial cells is to repress the expression of the tin gene and at least one of its targets, the beta3 tubulin gene. further differences in the cells are substantiated by the identification of separable enhancers for d-mef2 gene transcription in the distinct cardioblast sets. taken together, these results demonstrate a greater cellular and genetic complexity of the drosophila heart than previously appreciated.

cyclin e is an essential regulator of s phase entry. we have previously shown that transcriptional regulation of the gene that encodes drosophila cyclin e, dmcyce, plays an important role in the control of the g(1) to s phase transition during development. we report here the first comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional regulation of a g(1 )phase cell cycle regulatory gene during embryogenesis. analysis of deficiencies, a genomic transformant and reporter gene constructs revealed that dmcyce transcription is controlled by a large and complex cis-regulatory region containing tissue- and stage-specific components. separate regulatory elements for transcription in epidermal cells during cell cycles 14-16, central nervous system cells and peripheral nervous system cells were found. an additional cis-regulatory element drives transcription in thoracic epidermal cells that undergo a 17th cell cycle when other epidermal cells have arrested in g(1 )phase prior to terminal differentiation. the complexity of dmcyce transcriptional regulation argues against a model in which dmcyce transcription is regulated simply and solely by g(1) to s phase transcription regulators such as rb, e2f and dp. rather, our study demonstrates that tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are important components of the control of cyclin e transcription and thus of cell proliferation in metazoans.

the tata box binding protein (tbp) is a general transcription factor required for initiation by all three eukaryotic rna polymerases. previously, we found that the promoter region of the drosophila melanogaster tbp gene contains three sequences similar to the dna replication-related element (dre) (5'-tatcgata). in the present study, we found that the dre-like sequences are also present in the promoter of the drosophila virilis tbp gene, suggesting a role for these sequences in tbp expression. band mobility shift assays revealed that oligonucleotides containing sequences similar to the dre of d. melanogaster tbp gene promoter form specific complexes with a factor in a kc cell nuclear extract and with recombinant dre-binding factor (dref). furthermore, these complexes were either supershifted or diminished by monoclonal antibodies to dref. transient luciferase assays demonstrated that induction of mutations in two dre-related sequences at positions -223 and -63 resulted in an extensive reduction of promoter activity. thus, the dre-dref system appears to be involved in the expression of the d. melanogaster tbp gene.

ras signaling elicits diverse outputs, yet how ras specificity is generated remains incompletely understood. we demonstrate that wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) confer competence for receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated induction of a subset of drosophila muscle and cardiac progenitors by acting both upstream of and in parallel to ras. in addition to regulating the expression of proximal ras pathway components, wg and dpp coordinate the direct effects of three signal-activated (dtcf, mad, and pointed-functioning in the wg, dpp, and ras/mapk pathways, respectively) and two tissue-restricted (twist and tinman) transcription factors on a progenitor identity gene enhancer. the integration of pointed with the combinatorial effects of dtcf, mad, twist, and tinman determines inductive ras signaling specificity in muscle and heart development.

how multifunctional signals combine to specify unique cell fates during pattern formation is not well understood. here, we demonstrate that together with the transcription factor lozenge, the nuclear effectors of the egfr and notch signaling pathways directly regulate d-pax2 transcription in cone cells of the drosophila eye disc. moreover, the specificity of d-pax2 expression can be altered upon genetic manipulation of these inputs. thus, a relatively small number of temporally and spatially controlled signals received by a set of pluripotent cells can create the unique combinations of activated transcription factors required to regulate target genes and ultimately specify distinct cell fates within this group. we expect that similar mechanisms may specify pattern formation in vertebrate developmental systems that involve intercellular communication.

regulated transcription of the prospero gene in the drosophila eye provides a model for how gene expression is specifically controlled by signals from receptor tyrosine kinases. we show that prospero is controlled by signals from the egf receptor der and the sevenless receptor. a direct link is established between der activation of a transcription enhancer in prospero and binding of two transcription factors that are targets of der signaling. binding of the cell-specific lozenge protein is also required for activation, and overlapping lozenge protein distribution and der signaling establishes expression in a subset of equivalent cells competent to respond to sevenless. we show that sevenless activates prospero independent of the enhancer and involves targeted degradation of tramtrack, a transcription repressor.

inactivation of either the secreted protein wingless (wg) or the forkhead domain transcription factor sloppy paired (slp) has been shown to produce similar effects in the developing drosophila embryo. in the ectoderm, both gene products are required for the formation of the segmental portions marked by naked cuticle. in the mesoderm, wg and slp activities are crucial for the suppression of bagpipe (bap), and hence visceral mesoderm formation, and the promotion of somatic muscle and heart formation within the anterior portion of each parasegment. in this report, we show that, during these developmental processes, wg and slp act in a common pathway in which slp serves as a direct target of wg signals that mediates wg effects in both germ layers. we present evidence that the induction of slp by wg involves binding of the wg effector pangolin (drosophila lef-1/tcf) to multiple binding sites within a wg-responsive enhancer that is located in 5' flanking regions of the slp1 gene. based upon our genetic and molecular analysis, we conclude that wg signaling induces striped expression of slp in the mesoderm. mesodermal slp is then sufficient to abrogate the induction of bagpipe by dpp/tinman, which explains the periodic arrangement of trunk visceral mesoderm primordia in wild type embryos. conversely, mesodermal slp is positively required, although not sufficient, for the specification of somatic muscle and heart progenitors. we propose that wg-induced slp provides striped mesodermal domains with the competence to respond to subsequent slp-independent wg signals that induce somatic muscle and heart progenitors. we also propose that in wg-expressing ectodermal cells, slp is an integral component in an autocrine feedback loop of wg signaling.

the gradient morphogen decapentaplegic (dpp) organizes pattern by inducing the transcription of different target genes at distinct threshold concentrations during drosophila development. an important, albeit indirect, mode by which dpp controls the spatial extent of its targets is via the graded downregulation of brinker, whose product in turn negatively regulates the expression of these targets. here we report the molecular dissection of the cis-regulatory sequences of optomotor-blind (omb), a dpp target gene in the wing. we identify a minimal 284 bp dpp response element and demonstrate that it is subject to brinker (brk) repression. using this omb wing enhancer, we show that brk is a sequence-specific dna binding protein. mutations in the high-affinity brk binding site abolish responsiveness of this omb enhancer to brk and also compromise the input of an unknown transcriptional activator. our results therefore identify brk as a novel transcription factor antagonizing dpp signalling by directly binding target genes and repressing their expression.

the steroid hormone ecdysone controls multiple aspects of insect development, including larval moults and metamorphosis, and can induce specific genetic responses in different tissues. the definition of the molecular mechanisms able to mediate this tissue-specific responsiveness may greatly contribute to understanding how such an accurate genetic response is achieved. in this work we have identified, by transgenic analysis, the regulatory elements directing the expression of ng-1, an ecdysone-regulated drosophila gene showing a highly specific developmental expression profile. our results show that an ecdysone-responsive element located within the ng-1 coding region is necessary for high-level gene expression, whereas the gene's spatial and temporal expression profile is fully controlled by a distinct upstream regulatory region. this region binds a set of transcriptional factors, including the fkh regulatory protein, which can potentially modulate the ecdysone genetic regulated response.

suppressor of hairless [su(h)]/lag-1/rbp-jkappa/cbf1 is the only known transducing transcription factor for notch receptor signaling. here, we show that su(h) has three distinct functions in the development of external mechanosensory organs in drosophila: notch-dependent transcriptional activation and a novel auto-repression function, both of which direct cell fate decisions, and a novel auto-activation function required for normal socket cell differentiation. this third phase of activity, the first known notch-independent activation function for su(h) in development, depends on a cell type-specific autoregulatory enhancer that is active throughout adult life and is required for proper mechanoreception. these results establish a direct link between a broadly deployed cell signaling pathway and an essential physiological function of the nervous system.

the nona gene of drosophila melanogaster is important for normal vision, courtship song, and viability and lies approximately 350 bp downstream of the dgpi1 gene. full rescue of nona mutant phenotypes can be achieved by transformation with a genomic clone that carries approximately 2 kb of 5' regulatory material and that encodes most of the coding sequence of dgpi1. we have analyzed this 5' region by making a series of deleted fragments, fusing them to yeast gal4 sequences, and driving uas-nona expression in a mutant nona background. regions that both silence and enhance developmental tissue-specific expression of nona and that are necessary for generating optomotor visual responses are identified. some of these overlap the dgpi1 sequences, revealing cis-regulation by neighboring gene sequences. the largest 5' fragment was unable to rescue the normal electroretinogram (erg) consistently, and no rescue at all was observed for the courtship song phenotype. we suggest that sequences within the nona introns that were missing in the uas-nona cdna may carry enhancer elements for these two phenotypes. finally, we speculate on the striking observation that some of the cis-regulatory regions of nona appear to be embedded within the coding regions of dgpi1.

cell-cell signaling mediated by notch is critical during many different developmental processes for the specification or restriction of cell fates. currently, the only known transduction pathway involves a dna binding protein, suppressor of hairless [su(h)] in drosophila and cbf1 in mammals, and results in the direct activation of target genes. it has been proposed that in the absence of notch, su(h)/cbf1 acts as a repressor and is converted into an activator through interactions with the notch intracellular domain [1--4]. recently, we have also suggested that the activation of specific target genes requires synergy between su(h) and other transcriptional activators [5]. here we have designed an assay that allows us to directly test these hypotheses in vivo. our results clearly demonstrate that su(h) is able to function as the core of a molecular switch, repressing transcription in the absence of notch and activating in the presence of notch. in its capacity as an activator, su(h) can cooperate synergistically with a dna-bound transcription factor, grainyhead. these interactions indicate a simple model for notch target-gene regulation that could explain the precision of gene activation elicited by notch signaling in different developmental fate decisions.

small hydrophobic hormones like steroids control many tissue-specific physiological responses in higher organisms. hormone response is characterized by changes in gene expression, but the molecular details connecting target-gene transcription to the physiology of responding cells remain elusive. the salivary glands of drosophila provide an ideal model system to investigate gaps in our knowledge, because exposure to the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20e) leads to a robust regulated secretion of glue granules after a stereotypical pattern of puffs (activated 20e-regulated genes) forms on the polytene chromosomes. here, we describe a convenient bioassay for glue secretion and use it to analyze mutants in components of the puffing hierarchy. we show that 20e mediates secretion through the ecr/usp receptor, and two early-gene products, the rbp(+) function of br-c and the ca2+ binding protein e63-1, are involved. furthermore, we demonstrate that 20e treatment of salivary glands leads to ca2+ elevations by a genomic mechanism and that elevated ca2+ levels are required for ectopically produced e63-1 to drive secretion. the results presented establish a connection between 20e exposure and changes in ca2+ levels that are mediated by ca2+ effector proteins, and thus establish a mechanistic framework for future studies.

the drosophila eye is widely used as a model system to study neuronal differentiation, survival and axon projection. photoreceptor differentiation starts with the specification of a founder cell r8, which sequentially recruits other photoreceptor neurons to the ommatidium. the eight photoreceptors that compose each ommatidium exist in two chiral forms organized along two axes of symmetry and this pattern represents a paradigm to study tissue polarity. we have developed a method of fluoroscopy to visualize the different types of photoreceptors and the organization of the ommatidia in living animals. this allowed us to perform an f(1) genetic screen to isolate mutants affecting photoreceptor differentiation, survival or planar polarity. we illustrate the power of this detection system using known genetic backgrounds and new mutations that affect ommatidial differentiation, morphology or chirality.

the drosophila rhodopsin genes (rh's) represent a unique family of highly regulated cell-specific genes, where each member has its own expression pattern in the visual system. extensive analysis of the rh's has revealed several functional elements that are involved in cell-specificity. we have investigated the functional role of the rcsi/p3 site that is found in the proximal promoter of all drosophila rh genes. this sequence is remarkably conserved in evolution and is located 15-30 bp upstream of the tata box. we have previously shown that, in the context of the rh1 promoter, this element is recognized in vivo by a pax6 protein, the master regulator of eye development. thus, rh regulation might represent the ancestral function of pax6. here, we investigated the role of the rcsi/p3 sequence in the other rh genes and show that they also mediate pax6 function. we also tested the potential impact of the various rcsi/p3 sequences on the precise cell-specific expression of rh genes. our results demonstrate that, even though all rcsi/p3 sequences bind pax6, they are clearly distinct in various rh promoters and these differences are conserved throughout evolution: rcsi/p3 appears to participate in the fine-tuning of cell-specificity. we also show that pax6 or a related pax protein may be involved in the regulation of olfactory genes. therefore, in addition to performing a global photoreceptor-specific function, rcsi also appears to mediate the combined action of pax6 and other factors and to contribute to rh regulation in subsets of photoreceptors.

the drosophila single-minded gene controls cns midline cell development by both activating midline gene expression and repressing lateral cns gene expression in the midline cells. the mechanism by which single-minded represses transcription was examined using the ventral nervous system defective gene as a target gene. transgenic-lacz analysis of constructs containing fragments of the ventral nervous system defective regulatory region identified sequences required for lateral cns transcription and midline repression. elimination of single-minded:tango binding sites within the ventral nervous system defective gene did not affect midline repression. mutants of single-minded that removed the dna binding and transcriptional activation regions abolished ventral nervous system defective repression, as well as transcriptional activation of other genes. the replacement of the single-minded transcriptional activation region with a heterologous vp16 transcriptional activation region restored the ability of single-minded to both activate and repress transcription. these results indicate that single-minded indirectly represses transcription by activating the expression of repressive factors. single-minded provides a model system for how regulatory proteins that act only as transcriptional activators can control lineage-specific transcription in both positive and negative modes.

a novel family of candidate gustatory receptors (grs) was recently identified in searches of the drosophila genome. we have performed in situ hybridization and transgene experiments that reveal expression of these genes in both gustatory and olfactory neurons in adult flies and larvae. this gene family is likely to encode both odorant and taste receptors. we have visualized the projections of chemosensory neurons in the larval brain and observe that neurons expressing different grs project to discrete loci in the antennal lobe and subesophageal ganglion. these data provide insight into the diversity of chemosensory recognition and an initial view of the representation of gustatory information in the fly brain.

hox genes control segment identity in the mesoderm as well as in other tissues. most evidence indicates that hox genes act cell-autonomously in muscle development, although this remains a controversial issue. we show that apterous expression in the somatic mesoderm is under direct hox control. we have identified a small enhancer element of apterous (apme680) that regulates reporter gene expression in the lt1-4 muscle progenitors. we show that the product of the hox gene antennapedia is present in the somatic mesoderm of the second and third thoracic segments. through complementary alterations in the antennapedia protein and in its binding sites on apme680, we show that antennapedia positively regulates apterous in a direct manner, demonstrating unambiguously its cell-autonomous role in muscle development. finally, we determine that lt1-4 muscles contain more nuclei in the thorax than in the abdomen and we propose that one of the segmental differences under hox control is the number of myoblasts allocated to the formation of specific muscles in different segments.

the drosophila innate immune system discriminates between pathogens and responds by inducing the expression of specific antimicrobial peptide-encoding genes through distinct signaling cascades. fungal infection activates nf-kappab-like transcription factors via the toll pathway, which also regulates innate immune responses in mammals. the pathways that mediate antibacterial defenses, however, are less defined. we have isolated loss-of-function mutations in the caspase encoding gene dredd, which block the expression of all genes that code for peptides with antibacterial activity. these mutations also render flies highly susceptible to infection by gram-negative bacteria. our results demonstrate that dredd regulates antibacterial peptide gene expression, and we propose that dredd, immune deficiency and the p105-like rel protein relish define a pathway that is required to resist gram-negative bacterial infections.

evolutionarily conserved ovo loci encode developmentally regulated, sequence-specific, dna-binding, c(2)h(2)-zinc-finger proteins required in the germline and epidermal cells of flies and mice. the direct targets of ovo activity are not known. genetic experiments suggest that ovo acts in the same regulatory network as ovarian tumor (otu), but the relative position of these genes in the pathway is controversial. three ovo-binding sites exist in a compact regulatory region that controls germline expression of the otu gene. interestingly, the strongest ovo-binding site is very near the otu transcription start, where basal transcriptional complexes must function. loss-of-function, gain-of-function and promoter swapping constructs demonstrate that ovo binding near the transcription start site is required for ovo-dependent otu transcription in vivo. these data unambiguously identify otu as a direct ovo target gene and raise the tantalizing possibility that an ovo site, at the location normally occupied by basal components, functions as part of a specialized core promoter.

the formation of many complex structures is controlled by a special class of transcription factors encoded by selector genes. it is shown that scalloped, the dna binding component of the selector protein complex for the drosophila wing field, binds to and directly regulates the cis-regulatory elements of many individual target genes within the genetic regulatory network controlling wing development. furthermore, combinations of binding sites for scalloped and transcriptional effectors of signaling pathways are necessary and sufficient to specify wing-specific responses to different signaling pathways. the obligate integration of selector and signaling protein inputs on cis-regulatory dna may be a general mechanism by which selector proteins control extensive genetic regulatory networks during development.

"transcription of genes coding for metazoan spliceosomal snrnas by rna polymerase ii (u1, u2, u4, u5) or rna polymerase iii (u6) is dependent upon a unique, positionally conserved regulatory element referred to as the proximal sequence element (pse). previous studies in the organism drosophila melanogaster indicated that as few as three nucleotide differences in the sequences of the u1 and u6 pses can play a decisive role in recruiting the different rna polymerases to transcribe the u1 and u6 snrna genes in vitro. those studies utilized constructs that contained only the minimal promoter elements of the u1 and u6 genes in an artificial context. to overcome the limitations of those earlier studies, we have now performed experiments that demonstrate that the drosophila u1 and u6 pses have functionally distinct properties even in the environment of the natural u1 and u6 gene 5'-flanking dnas. moreover, assays in cells and in transgenic flies indicate that expression of genes from promoters that contain the ""incorrect"" pse is suppressed in vivo. the drosophila u6 pse is incapable of recruiting rna polymerase ii to initiate transcription from the u1 promoter region, and the u1 pse is unable to recruit rna polymerase iii to transcribe the u6 gene."

background: the mammalian receptor protein tyrosine kinase (rtk), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk), was first described as the product of the t(2;5) chromosomal translocation found in non-hodgkin's lymphoma. while the mechanism of alk activation in non-hodgkin's lymphoma has been examined, to date, no in vivo role for this orphan insulin receptor family rtk has been described. results: we describe here a novel drosophila melanogaster rtk, dalk, which we have mapped to band 53 on the right arm of the second chromosome. full-length dalk cdna encodes a phosphoprotein of 200 kda, which shares homology not only with mammalian alk but also with the orphan rtk ltk. analysis of both mammalian and drosophila alk reveals that the alk family of rtks contains a newly identified mam domain within their extracellular domains. like its mammalian counterpart, dalk appears to be expressed in the developing cns by in situ analysis. however, in addition to expression of dalk in the drosophila brain, careful analysis reveals an additional early role for dalk in the developing visceral mesoderm where its expression is coincident with activated erk. conclusion: in this paper we describe a drosophila melanogaster alk rtk which is expressed in the developing embryonic mesoderm and cns. our data provide evidence for the existence of a dalk rtk pathway in drosophila. we show that erk participates in this pathway, and that it is activated by dalk in vivo. expression patterns of dalk, together with activated erk, suggest that dalk fulfils the criteria of the missing rtk pathway, leading to erk activation in the developing visceral mesoderm.

background: taste is an important sensory modality in most animals. in drosophila, taste is perceived by gustatory neurons located in sensilla distributed on several different appendages throughout the body of the animal. here we show that the gustatory receptors are encoded by a family of at least 54 genes (gr genes), most of which are expressed exclusively in a small subset of taste sensilla located in narrowly defined regions of the fly's body. results: blast searches with the predicted amino acid sequences of 6 7-transmembrane-receptor genes of unknown function and 20 previously identified, putative gustatory receptor genes led to the identification of a large gene family comprising at least 54 genes. we investigated the expression of eight genes by using a gal4 reporter gene assay and found that five of them were expressed in the gustatory system of the fly. four genes were expressed in 1%-4% of taste sensilla, located in well-defined regions of the proboscis, the legs, or both. the fifth gene was expressed in about 20% of taste sensilla in all major gustatory organs, including the taste bristles on the anterior wing margin. axon-tracing experiments demonstrated that neurons expressing a given gr gene project their axons to a spatially restricted domain of the subesophageal ganglion in the fly brain. conclusions: our findings suggest that each taste sensillum represents a discrete, functional unit expressing at least one gr receptor and that most gr genes are expressed in spatially restricted domains of the gustatory system. these observations imply the potential for high taste discrimination of the drosophila brain.

in the early drosophila embryo, a system of coordinates is laid down by segmentation genes and dorsoventral patterning genes. subsequently, these coordinates must be interpreted to define particular tissues and organs. to begin understanding this process for a single organ, we have studied how one of the first salivary gland genes, fork head (fkh), is turned on in the primordium of this organ, the salivary placode. a placode-specific fkh enhancer was identified 10 kb from the coding sequence. dissection of this enhancer showed that the apparently homogeneous placode is actually composed of at least four overlapping domains. these domains appear to be developmentally important because they predict the order of salivary invagination, are evolutionarily conserved, and are regulated by patterning genes that are important for salivary development. three dorsoventral domains are defined by egf receptor (egfr) signaling, while stripes located at the anterior and posterior edges of the placode depend on wingless signaling. further analysis identified sites in the enhancer that respond either positively to the primary activator of salivary gland genes, sex combs reduced (scr), or negatively to egfr signaling. these results show that fkh integrates spatial pattern directly, without reference to other early salivary gland genes. in addition, we identified a binding site for fkh protein that appears to act in fkh autoregulation, keeping the gene active after scr has disappeared from the placode. this autoregulation may explain how the salivary gland maintains its identity after the organ is established. although the fkh enhancer integrates information needed to define the salivary placode, and although fkh mutants have the most extreme effects on salivary gland development thus far described, we argue that fkh is not a selector gene for salivary gland development and that there is no master, salivary gland selector gene. instead, several genes independently sense spatial information and cooperate to define the salivary placode.

a central theme during development and homeostasis is the generation of cell type-specific responses to the action of a limited number of extant signaling cascades triggered by extracellular ligands. the molecular mechanisms by which information from such signals are integrated in responding cells in a cell-type specific manner remain poorly understood. we have undertaken a detailed characterization of an enhancer that is regulated by dpp signaling and by the homeotic protein labial and its partners, extradenticle and homothorax. the expression driven by this enhancer (lab550) and numerous deletions and point mutants thereof was studied in wild-type and mutant drosophila embryos as well as in cultured cells. we find that the lab550 enhancer is composed of two elements, a homeotic response element (homre) and a dpp response element (dppre) that synergize. none of these two elements can reproduce the expression of lab550, either with regard to expression level or with regard to spatial restriction. the isolated dppre of lab550 responds extremely weakly to dpp. interestingly, we found that the inducibility of this dppre is weak because it is tuned down by the action of a repressor element. this repressor element and an additional 50 bp element appear to be crucial for the cooperation of the homre and the dppre, and might tightly link the dpp response to the homeotic input. the cooperation between the different elements of the enhancer leads to the segmentally restricted activity of lab550 in the endoderm and provides a mechanism to create specific responses to dpp signaling with the help of a hox protein complex.

the subdivision of the lateral mesoderm into a visceral (splanchnic) and a somatic layer is a crucial event during early mesoderm development in both arthropod and vertebrate embryos. in drosophila, this subdivision leads to the differential development of gut musculature versus body wall musculature. here we report that biniou, the sole drosophila representative of the foxf subfamily of forkhead domain genes, has a key role in the development of the visceral mesoderm and the derived gut musculature. biniou expression is activated in the trunk visceral mesoderm primordia downstream of dpp, tinman, and bagpipe and is maintained in all types of developing gut muscles. we show that biniou activity is essential for maintaining the distinction between splanchnic and somatic mesoderm and for differentiation of the splanchnic mesoderm into midgut musculature. biniou is required not only for the activation of differentiation genes that are expressed ubiquitously in the trunk visceral mesoderm but also for the expression of dpp in parasegment 7, which governs proper midgut morphogenesis. activation of dpp is mediated by specific biniou binding sites in a dpp enhancer element, which suggests that biniou serves as a tissue-specific cofactor of homeotic gene products in visceral mesoderm patterning. based upon these and other data, we propose that the splanchnic mesoderm layers in drosophila and vertebrate embryos are homologous structures whose development into gut musculature and other visceral organs is critically dependent on foxf genes.

we report the molecular characterization of the immune deficiency (imd) gene, which controls antibacterial defense in drosophila. imd encodes a protein with a death domain similar to that of mammalian rip (receptor interacting protein), a protein that plays a role in both nf-kappab activation and apoptosis. we show that imd functions upstream of the dmikk signalosome and the caspase dredd in the control of antibacterial peptide genes. strikingly, overexpression of imd leads to constitutive transcription of these genes and to apoptosis, and both effects are blocked by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor p35. we also show that imd is involved in the apoptotic response to uv irradiation. these data raise the possibility that antibacterial response and apoptosis share common control elements in drosophila.

we identified a large family of putative odorant-binding protein (obp) genes in the genome of drosophila melanogaster. some of these genes are present in large clusters in the genome. most members are expressed in various taste organs, including gustatory sensilla in the labellum, the pharyngeal labral sense organ, dorsal and ventral cibarial organs, as well as taste bristles located on the wings and tarsi. some of the gustatory obps are expressed exclusively in taste organs, but most are expressed in both olfactory and gustatory sensilla. multiple binding proteins can be coexpressed in the same gustatory sensillum. cells in the tarsi that express obps are required for normal chemosensation mediated through the leg, as ablation of these cells dramatically reduces the sensitivity of the proboscis extension reflex to sucrose. finally, we show that obp genes expressed in the pharyngeal taste sensilla are still expressed in the poxneuro genetic background while obps expressed in the labellum are not. these findings support a broad role for members of the obp family in gustation and olfaction and suggest that poxneuro is required for cell fate determination of labellar but not pharyngeal taste organs.

unlike gap genes in the trunk region of drosophila embryos, gap genes in the head were presumed not to regulate each other's transcription. here, we show that in tailless (tll) loss-of-function mutants the empty spiracles (ems) expression domain in the head expands, whereas it retracts in tll gain-of-function embryos. we have identified a 304bp element in the ems-enhancer which is sufficient to drive expression in the head and brain and which contains two tll and two bcd binding sites. transgenic reporter gene lines containing mutations of the tll binding sites demonstrate that tll directly inhibits the expression of ems in the early embryonic head and the protocerebral brain anlage. these results are the first demonstration of direct transcriptional regulation between gap genes in the head.

to identify regulatory events occurring during myogenesis, we characterized the transcriptional regulation of a drosophila melanogaster actin gene, actin 57b. act57b transcription is first detected in visceral muscle precursors and is detectable in all embryonic muscles by the end of embryogenesis. through deletion analysis we identified a 595 bp promoter element that was sufficient for high levels of expression in all three muscle lineages. this fragment contained a mef2 binding site conserved between d. melanogaster and drosophila virilis which bound mef2 protein in embryo nuclear extracts. mutation of the mef2 site severely reduced promoter activity in embryos, and in mef2 mutants act57b expression was severely decreased, demonstrating mef2 is an essential regulator of act57b. we also showed that mef2 likely acts synergistically with factors bound to additional sequences within the 595 bp element. these findings underline the importance of mef2 in controlling differentiation in all muscle lineages. our experiments reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for a structural gene where high levels of expression in all embryonic muscles is regulated through a single transcription factor binding site.

vnd/nk-2 protein was detected in 11 neuroblasts per hemisegment in drosophila embryos, 9 medial and 2 intermediate neuroblasts. fragments of dna from the 5'-flanking region of the vnd/nk-2 gene were inserted upstream of an enhancerless betagalactosidase gene in a p-element and used to generate transgenic fly lines. antibodies directed against vnd/nk-2 and beta-galactosidase proteins then were used in double-label experiments to correlate the expression of beta-galactosidase and vnd/nk-2 proteins in identified neuroblasts. dna region a, which corresponds to the -4.0 to -2.8-kb fragment of dna from the 5'-flanking region of the vnd/nk-2 gene was shown to contain one or more strong enhancers required for expression of the vnd/nk-2 gene in ten neuroblasts. dna region b (-5.3 to -4.0 kb) contains moderately strong enhancers for vnd/nk-2 gene expression in four neuroblasts. hypothesized dna region c, whose location was not identified, contains one or more enhancers that activate vnd/nk-2 gene expression only in one neuroblast. these results show that nucleotide sequences in at least three regions of dna regulate the expression of the vnd/nk-2 gene, that the vnd/nk-2 gene can be activated in different ways in different neuroblasts, and that the pattern of vnd/nk-2 gene expression in neuroblasts of the ventral nerve cord is the sum of partial patterns.

"metazoan genomes contain vast tracts of cis-regulatory dna that have been identified typically through tedious functional assays. as a result, it has not been possible to uncover a cis-regulatory code that links primary dna sequences to gene expression patterns. in an initial effort to determine whether coordinately regulated genes share a common ""grammar,"" we have examined the distribution of dorsal recognition sequences in the drosophila genome. dorsal is one of the best-characterized sequence-specific transcription factors in drosophila. the homeobox gene zerknullt (zen) is repressed directly by dorsal, and this repression is mediated by a 600-bp silencer, the ventral repression element (vre), which contains four optimal dorsal binding sites. the arrangement and sequence of the dorsal recognition sequences in the vre were used to develop a computational algorithm to search the drosophila genome for clusters of optimal dorsal binding sites. there are 15 regions in the genome that contain three or more optimal sites within a span of 400 bp or less. three of these regions are associated with known dorsal target genes: sog, zen, and brinker. the dorsal binding cluster in sog is shown to mediate lateral stripes of gene expression in response to low levels of the dorsal gradient. two of the remaining 12 clusters are shown to be associated with genes that exhibit asymmetric patterns of expression across the dorsoventral axis. these results suggest that bioinformatics can be used to identify novel target genes and associated regulatory dnas in a gene network."

individual somatic muscles and heart progenitors are specified at defined positions within the mesodermal layer of drosophila. the expression of the homeobox gene even-skipped (eve) identifies one specific subset of cells in the dorsal mesoderm, which give rise to particular pericardial cells and dorsal body wall muscles. genetic analysis has shown that the induction of eve in these cells involves the combined activities of genes encoding mesoderm-intrinsic factors, such as tinman (tin), and spatially restricted signaling activities that are largely derived from the ectoderm, particularly those encoded by wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp). here we show that a dpp-activated smad protein, phosphorylated mad, is colocalized in eve-expressing cells during an extended developmental period. we demonstrate further that a mesodermally active enhancer of eve contains several smad and tin binding sites that are essential for enhancer activity in vivo. this enhancer also contains a number of binding sites for the wg-effector pangolin (pan/lef-1), which are required for full levels of enhancer activity. however, we find that their main function is to prevent ectopic enhancer activity in the dorsal mesoderm. this suggests that, in the absence of wg signaling, pan binding serves to abrogate the synergistic activities of smads and tin in eve activation while, in cells that receive wg signals, pan is converted into a coactivator that promotes eve induction. together, these data show that the eve enhancer integrates several regulatory pathways via the combinatorial binding of the mesoderm-intrinsic regulator tin and the effectors of the dpp and wg signals.

the drosophila pax gene paired encodes a transcription factor that is required for the activation of segment-polarity genes and proper segmentation of the larval cuticle, postembryonic viability and male fertility. we show that paired executes a dual role in the development of male accessory glands, the organ homologous to the human prostate. an early function is necessary to promote cell proliferation, whereas a late function, which regulates the expression of accessory gland products such as the sex peptide and acp26aa protein, is essential for maturation and differentiation of accessory glands. the late function exhibits in main and secondary secretory cells of accessory glands dynamic patterns of paired expression that depend in both cell types on the mating activity of adult males, possibly because paired expression is regulated by negative feedback. the early paired function depends on domains or motifs in its c-terminal moiety and the late function on the dna-binding specificity of its n-terminal paired-domain and/or homeodomain. both paired functions are absolutely required for male fertility, and both depend on an enhancer located within 0.8 kb of the downstream region of paired.

at the end of each developmental stage, insects perform a stereotypic behavioral sequence leading to ecdysis of the old cuticle. while ecdysis-triggering hormone (eth) is sufficient to trigger this sequence, it has remained unclear whether it is required. we show that deletion of eth, the gene encoding eth in drosophila, leads to lethal behavioral and physiological deficits. null mutants (eth(-)) fail to inflate the new respiratory system on schedule, do not perform the ecdysis behavioral sequence, and exhibit the phenotype buttoned-up, which is characterized by incomplete ecdysis and 98% mortality at the transition from first to second larval instar. precisely timed injection of synthetic dmeth1 restores all deficits and allows normal ecdysis to occur. these findings establish obligatory roles for eth and its gene products in initiation and regulation of the ecdysis sequence. the eth signaling system provides an opportunity for genetic analysis of a chemically coded physiological and behavioral sequence.

drosophila eye development is under the control of early eye specifying genes including eyeless (ey), twin of eyeless (toy), eyes absent (eya), dachshund (dac) and sine oculis (so). they are all conserved between vertebrates and insects and they interact in a combinatorial and hierarchical network to regulate each other expression. so has been shown to be directly regulated by ey through an eye-specific enhancer (so10). we further studied the regulation of this element and found that both drosophila pax6 proteins namely ey and toy bind and positively regulate so10 expression through different binding sites. by targeted mutagenesis experiments, we disrupted these ey and toy binding sites and studied their functional involvement in the so10 enhancer expression in the eye progenitor cells. we show a differential requirement for the ey and toy binding sites in activating so10 during the different stages of eye development. additionally, in a rescue experiment performed in the so(1) mutant, we show that the ey and toy binding sites are required for compound eye and ocellus development respectively. altogether, these results suggest a differential requirement for ey and toy to specify the development of the two types of adult visual systems, namely the compound eye and the ocellus.

the insect fat body is a dynamic tissue involved in maintaining homeostasis. it functions not only in energy storage and intermediary metabolism but also in detoxification, communication and the immune response. some of these functions are confined to distinct groups of fat body cells. in drosophila melanogaster, discrete precursor-cell clusters populate the fat body [hoshizaki, d.k., blackburn, t., price, c., ghosh, m., miles, k., ragucci, m. and sweis, r. (1994) embryonic fat-cell lineage in drosophila melanogaster. development 120: 2489-2499; hoshizaki, d.k., lunz, r., ghosh, m. and johnson, w. (1995) identification of fat-cell enhancer activity in drosophila melanogaster using p-element enhancer traps. genome 38: 497-506; riechmann, v., rehorn, k.p., reuter, r. and leptin, m. (1998) the genetic control of the distinction between fat body and gonadal mesoderm in drosophila. development 125: 713-723]. whether these clusters populate defined morphological regions or whether they represent the precursors to functionally similar groups of fat-body cells has not been formally demonstrated. we have identified a 2.1 kb enhancer region from serpent (srp), a gata transcription factor gene that is sufficient to induce fat-cell formation. this enhancer region drives expression in specific groups of precursor-cell clusters, which we show give rise to defined regions of the mature embryonic fat body. we present evidence that srp expression in different precursor fat cells is controlled by independent cis-acting regulatory regions, and we have tested the role of trans-acting factors in the specification of some of these cells. we suggest that the different positional cues regulating srp expression, and therefore general fat-cell specification, might also be involved in the functional specialization of fat cells. this may be a common mechanism in insects to explain the origin of biochemically distinct regions of the larval/adult fat body.

organogenesis requires coordination between developmental programs and cell cycle progression. the cip/kip families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cki) are main effectors linking these two programs. in many instances, expression of cip/kip ckis are increased abruptly in cells entering their last mitotic cycle, suggesting that cki expression is developmentally regulated. expression of dacapo (dap), a drosophila cip/kip cki, is transiently up-regulated immediately before cells enter g1 arrest. here we report that dap transcription is controlled by modular arrays of tissues specific cis-regulatory elements. furthermore, we identified pan-neural prospero as a regulator of dap transcription in the developing nervous system, providing an example how tissue-specific developmental programs can be linked to cell cycle progression.

the vasa gene (vas) is essential for germline development in drosophila melanogaster. zygotic vas is expressed in pole cells earlier than any other pole cell-expressing genes thus far identified, and vas protein is continuously present in germline cells throughout development. here, we report the identification of a regulatory region that directs germline-specific vas expression. a genomic fragment containing the vas locus was linked to enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp)-vas fusion gene, and the resulting gene was introduced into fly genome. developmental vas expression was assessed by monitoring the expression of egfp-vas in these transformants. the spatio-temporal expression pattern of egfp-vas is essentially identical to that of endogenous vas throughout germline development. by dissecting the vas promoter, we identified a 40-bp regulatory element, which is necessary and sufficient for germline-specific expression during oogenesis. this region interacts specifically with ovarian protein(s). furthermore, this region is also required for vas expression in pole cells during embryogenesis. these results suggest that a similar mechanism regulates vas expression both in oogenesis and embryogenesis.

brachyury proteins, a conserved subgroup of the t domain transcription factors, specify gut and posterior mesoderm derivatives throughout the animal kingdom. the t domain confers dna-binding properties to brachyury proteins, but little is known how these proteins regulate their target genes. we characterized a direct target gene of the drosophila brachyury-homolog brachyenteron. brachyenteron activates the homeobox gene orthopedia in a dose-dependent manner via multiple binding sites with the consensus (a/g)(a/t)(a/t)ntn(a/g)cac(c/t)t. the sites and their a/t-rich flanking regions are conserved between d. melanogaster and drosophila virilis. reporter assays and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that brachyenteron binding sites confer in part additive, in part synergistic effects on otp transcription levels. this suggests an interaction of brachyenteron proteins on the dna, which we could map to a conserved motif within the t domain. mouse brachyury also interacts with brachyenteron through this motif. we further show that the xenopus and mouse brachyury homologs activate orthopedia expression when expressed in drosophila embryonic cells. we propose that the mechanisms to achieve target gene expression through variable binding sites and through defined protein-protein interactions might be conserved for brachyury relatives.

receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) signaling plays an instructive role in cell fate decisions, whereas notch signaling is often involved in restricting cellular competence for differentiation. genetic interactions between these two evolutionarily conserved pathways have been extensively documented. the underlying molecular mechanisms, however, are not well understood. here, we show that yan, an ets transcriptional repressor that blocks cellular potential for specification and differentiation, is a target of notch signaling during drosophila eye development. the suppressor of hairless (su[h]) protein of the notch pathway is required for activating yan expression, and su(h) binds directly to an eye-specific yan enhancer in vitro. in contrast, yan expression is repressed by pointed (pnt), which is a key component of the rtk pathway. pnt binds specifically to the yan enhancer and competes with su(h) for dna binding. this competition illustrates a potential mechanism for rtk and notch signals to oppose each other. thus, yan serves as a common target of notch/su(h) and rtk/pointed signaling pathways during cell fate specification.

in the fruit fly drosophila, four insulin genes are coexpressed in small clusters of cells [insulin-producing cells (ipcs)] in the brain. here, we show that ablation of these ipcs causes developmental delay, growth retardation, and elevated carbohydrate levels in larval hemolymph. all of the defects were reversed by ectopic expression of a drosophila insulin transgene. on the basis of these functional data and the observation that ipcs release insulin into the circulatory system, we conclude that brain ipcs are the main systemic supply of insulin during larval growth. we propose that ipcs and pancreatic islet beta cells are functionally analogous and may have evolved from a common ancestral insulin-producing neuron. interestingly, the phenotype of flies lacking ipcs includes certain features of diabetes mellitus.

the steroid hormone ecdysone regulates both cell differentiation and cell death during insect metamorphosis, by hierarchical transcriptional regulation of a number of genes, including the broad-complex (br-c), the zinc finger family of transcription factors. these genes in turn regulate the transcription of a number of downstream genes. dronc, a key apical caspase in drosophila, is the only known caspase that is transcriptionally regulated by ecdysone during development. we demonstrate that dronc gene expression is ablated or reduced in br-c mutant flies. using rna interference in an ecdysone-responsive drosophila cell line, we show that dronc is essential for ecdysone-mediated cell death, and that dronc upregulation in these cells is controlled by br-c. finally, we show that the dronc promoter has br-c interaction sites, and that it can be transactivated by a specific isoform of br-c. these results indicate that br-c plays a key role in ecdysone-mediated caspase regulation.

the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene influences many developmental events in drosophila melanogaster. we have been analyzing dpp expression in two groups of dorsal ectoderm cells at the posterior end of the embryo, in abdominal segment 8 and the telson. these dpp-expressing cells become tracheal cells in the posterior-most branches of the tracheal system (dorsal branch10, spiracular branch10, and the posterior spiracle). these branches are not identified by reagents typically used in analyses of tracheal development, suggesting that dpp expression confers a distinct identity upon posterior tracheal cells. we have determined that dpp posterior ectoderm expression begins during germ band extension and continues throughout development. we have isolated the sequences responsible for these aspects of dpp expression in a reporter gene. we have determined that an unconventional form of wingless (wg) signaling, dpp signaling, and the transcriptional coactivator nejire (cbp/p300) are required for the initiation and maintenance of dpp expression in the posterior-most branches of the tracheal system. our data suggest a model for the integration of wg and dpp signals that may be applicable to branching morphogenesis in other developmental systems.

gene expression is regulated by transcription factors that interact with cis-regulatory elements. predicting these elements from sequence data has proven difficult. we describe here a successful computational search for elements that direct expression in a particular temporal-spatial pattern in the drosophila embryo, based on a single well characterized enhancer model. the fly genome was searched to identify sequence elements containing the same combination of transcription factors as those found in the model. experimental evaluation of the search results demonstrates that our method can correctly predict regulatory elements and highlights the importance of functional testing as a means of identifying false-positive results. we also show that the search results enable the identification of additional relevant sequence motifs whose functions can be empirically validated. this approach, combined with gene expression and phylogenetic sequence data, allows for genome-wide identification of related regulatory elements, an important step toward understanding the genetic regulatory networks involved in development.

a large fraction of the information content of metazoan genomes resides in the transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-regulatory elements that collectively provide the blueprint for using the protein-coding capacity of the dna, thus guiding the development and physiology of the entire organism. as successive whole-genome sequencing projects--including those of mice and humans--are completed, we have full access to the regulatory genome of yet another species. but our ability to decipher the cis-regulatory code, and hence to link genes into regulatory networks on a global scale, is currently very limited. here we describe score (site clustering over random expectation), a computational method for identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory modules based on the fact that they often contain, in statistically improbable concentrations, multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor. we have carried out a drosophila genomewide inventory of predicted binding sites for the notch-regulated transcription factor suppressor of hairless [su(h)] and found that the fly genome contains highly nonrandom clusterings of su(h) sites over a broad range of sequence intervals. we found that the most statistically significant clusters are very heavily enriched in both known and logical targets of su(h) binding and regulation. the utility of the score approach was validated by in vivo experiments showing that proper expression of the novel gene him in adult muscle precursor cells depends both on su(h) gene activity and sequences that include a previously unstudied cluster of four su(h) sites, indicating that him is a likely direct target of su(h).

in drosophila, the insecticide resistant 91-r strain is an overproducer and susceptible 91-c and ry(506) strains are the underproducers of cyp6a8 mrna encoded by a cytochrome p450 gene, cyp6a8. low expression of cyp6a8 in the underproducer strains is due to a downregulatory effect of a putative repressor locus, which is thought to be mutant in the overproducer strain. in the present investigation, organization of cyp6a8 and promoter activity of its upstream dna were analyzed. cyp6a8 has two introns of which intron ii is similar to the introns of other insect cyp genes with respect to its length and position. intron i is only 36 bp long and lacks consensus splice sites. it is also in-frame with the cyp6a8 open reading frame. therefore, inefficient splicing of intron i may produce two isoforms of cyp6a8. analysis of cyp6a8 upstream dna of the overproducer 91-r strain showed that dna sequences between -199 and -761 bp are required for the highest constitutive and barbital-induced expression of cyp6a8. this region has six barbie boxes and binding sites for various transcription factors. promoter activity of the -11/-761 dna of the overproducer 91-r strain was found to be 4-fold lower in the genome of underproducer ry(506) strain, which is wild type for the putative repressor gene, than in the genome of f1 hybrids of 91-r and ry(506) strains. these results suggest that -11/-761 cyp6a8 dna of the 91-r strain can respond to the active repressor present in the hybrid genome and further support our previous findings that overexpression of cyp6a8 is a result of mutation of a repressor gene rather than mutation of the cis-regulatory sequences.

elongation of the drosophila embryonic hindgut epithelium occurs by a process of oriented cell rearrangement requiring the genes drumstick (drm) and lines (lin). the elongating hindgut becomes subdivided into domains -- small intestine, large intestine and rectum -- each characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression dependent upon normal drm and lin function. we show that drm encodes an 81 amino acid (10 kda) zinc finger protein that is a member of the odd-skipped family. drm expression is localized to the developing midgut-hindgut junction and is required to establish the small intestine, while lin is broadly expressed throughout the gut primordium and represses small intestine fate. lin is epistatic to drm, suggesting a model in which localized expression of drm blocks lin activity, thereby allowing small intestine fate to be established. further supporting this model, ectopic expression of drm throughout the hindgut produces a lin phenotype. biochemical and genetic data indicate that the first conserved zinc finger of drm is essential for its function. we have thus defined a pathway in which a spatially localized zinc finger protein antagonizes a globally expressed protein, thereby leading to specification of a domain (the small intestine) necessary for oriented cell rearrangement.

previous studies have identified the nk homeobox gene bagpipe and the foxf fork head domain gene biniou as essential regulators of visceral mesoderm development in drosophila. here we present additional genetic and molecular information on the functions of these two genes during visceral mesoderm morphogenesis and differentiation. we show that both genes are required for the activation of beta 3tub60d in the visceral mesoderm, which encodes beta 3 tubulin. we demonstrate that a 254 bp derivative of a previously defined visceral mesoderm-specific enhancer element, vm1, from beta 3tub60d contains one specific in vitro binding site for bagpipe and two such sites for biniou. while the wild-type version of the 254 bp enhancer is able to drive significant levels of reporter gene expression within the entire trunk visceral mesoderm, mutation of either the bagpipe or the biniou binding sites within this element results in a severe decrease of enhancer activity. moreover, mutation of all three binding sites for bagpipe and biniou, respectively, results in the complete loss of enhancer activity. together, these observations suggest that bagpipe and biniou serve as direct, partially redundant, and tissue-specific activators of the terminal differentiation gene beta 3tub60d in the visceral mesoderm.

during drosophila metamorphosis, the 'early-late' genes constitute a unique class regulated by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. their induction is comprised of both a primary and a secondary response to ecdysone. previous work has suggested that the epidermal expression of the dopa decarboxylase gene (ddc) is likely that of a typical early-late gene. accumulation of the ddc transcript is rapidly initiated in the absence of protein synthesis, which implies that the ecdysone receptor plays a direct role in induction. however, full ddc expression requires the participation of one of the transcription factors encoded by the broad-complex. in this paper, we characterize an ecdysone response element (ecre) that contributes to the primary response. using gel mobility shift assays and transgenic assays, we identified a single functional ecre, located at position -97 to -83 bp relative to the transcription initiation site. this is the first report of an ecre associated with an early-late gene in drosophila. competition experiments indicated that the affinity of the ddc ecre for the ecdysone receptor complex was at least four-fold less than that of the canonical ecre of the hsp27 gene. using in vitro mutagenesis, we determined that the reduced affinity of the ecre resided at two positions where the nucleotides differed from those found in the canonical sequence. the ecdysone receptor, acting through this ecre, releases ddc from a silencing mechanism, whose cis-acting domain we have mapped to the 5'-upstream region between -2067 and -1427 bp. deletion of this repressive element resulted in precocious expression of ddc in both epidermis and imaginal discs. thus, epidermal ddc induction at pupariation is under the control of an extended genomic region that contains both positive and negative regulatory elements.

background: the insulin/igf-1 signaling pathway controls cellular and organismal growth in many multicellular organisms. in drosophila, genetic defects in components of the insulin signaling pathway produce small flies that are delayed in development and possess fewer and smaller cells as well as female sterility, reminiscent of the phenotypes of starved flies. results: here we establish a causal link between nutrient availability and insulin-dependent growth. we show that in addition to the drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (dilp2) gene, overexpression of dilp1 and dilp3-7 is sufficient to promote growth. three of the dilp genes are expressed in seven median neurosecretory cells (m-nscs) in the brain. these m-nscs possess axon terminals in the larval endocrine gland and on the aorta, from which dilps may be released into the circulatory system. although expressed in the same cells, the expression of the three genes is controlled by unrelated cis-regulatory elements. the expression of two of the three genes is regulated by nutrient availability. genetic ablation of these neurosecretory cells mimics the phenotype of starved or insulin signaling mutant flies. conclusions: these results point to a conserved role of the neuroendocrine axis in growth control in multicellular organisms.

gaga factor is involved in many nuclear transactions, notably in transcription as an activator in drosophila. the genomic region corresponding to the trl promoter has been obtained, and a minimal version of a fully active trl promoter has been defined using transient transfection assays in s2 cells. dnase i footprinting analysis has shown that this region contains multiple gaga binding sites, suggesting a potential regulatory role of gaga on its own promoter. the study shows that gaga down-regulates trl expression. the repression does not depend on the gaga isoform, but binding to dna is absolutely required. a fragment of the trl promoter can mediate repression to a heterologous promoter only upon gaga overexpression in transiently transfected s2 cells. chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of s2 cells confirmed that gaga factors are bound to the trl promoter over a region of 1.4 kbp. using a double-stranded rna interference approach, we show that endogenous gaga factors limit trl expression in s2 cells. our results open the possibility of observing similar gaga repressive effects on other promoters.

hox proteins control morphological diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals, but the cellular processes they directly regulate are poorly understood. we show that during early drosophila development, the hox protein deformed (dfd) maintains the boundary between the maxillary and mandibular head lobes by activating localized apoptosis. dfd accomplishes this by directly activating the cell death promoting gene reaper (rpr). one other hox gene, abdominal-b (abd-b), also regulates segment boundaries through the regional activation of apoptosis. thus, one mechanism used by drosophila hox genes to modulate segmental morphology is to regulate programmed cell death, which literally sculpts segments into distinct shapes. this and other emerging evidence suggests that hox proteins may often regulate the maintenance of segment boundaries.

--------------------

in drosophila, differences between segments, such as the presence or absence of appendages, are controlled by hox transcription factors. the hox protein ultrabithorax (ubx) suppresses limb formation in the abdomen by repressing the leg selector gene distalless, whereas antennapedia (antp), a thoracic hox protein, does not repress distalless. we show that the hox cofactors extradenticle and homothorax selectively enhance ubx, but not antp, binding to a distalless regulatory sequence. a c-terminal peptide in ubx stimulates binding to this site. however, dna binding is not sufficient for distalless repression. instead, an additional alternatively spliced domain in ubx is required for distalless repression but not dna binding. thus, the functional specificities of hox proteins depend on both dna binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

three classes of neurons form synapses in the antennal lobe of drosophila, the insect counterpart of the vertebrate olfactory bulb: olfactory receptor neurons, projection neurons, and inhibitory local interneurons. we have targeted a genetically encoded optical reporter of synaptic transmission to each of these classes of neurons and visualized population responses to natural odors. the activation of an odor-specific ensemble of olfactory receptor neurons leads to the activation of a symmetric ensemble of projection neurons across the glomerular synaptic relay. virtually all excited glomeruli receive inhibitory input from local interneurons. the extent, odor specificity, and partly interglomerular origin of this input suggest that inhibitory circuits assemble combinatorially during odor presentations. these circuits may serve as dynamic templates that extract higher order features from afferent activity patterns.

in this study, we sought to identify and characterize all the proteasome genes of drosophila melanogaster. earlier work led to the identification of two genes encoding alpha4-type 20s proteasome subunit isoforms that are expressed exclusively in the male germline. here we extend these results and show that six of the 20s proteasome subunits, and four of the 19s regulatory cap subunits, have gene duplications encoding male-specific isoforms. more detailed analyses of two of these male-specific subunits (prosalpha3t and prosalpha6t), using gfp-tagged reporter transgenes, revealed that they are predominantly localized to the nucleus at later stages of spermatogenesis and are present there in mature, motile sperm. these results suggest a possible role of a 'spermatogenesis-specific' proteasome in sperm differentiation and/or function.

we have dissected the entire cis-regulatory region of the drosophila pox neuro gene with regard to its enhancers, and have analyzed their functions by the selective addition to pox neuro null mutant flies of one or several functions, each regulated by a complete or partial enhancer. we have identified at least 15 enhancers with an astounding complexity in arrangement and substructure that regulate pox neuro functions required for the development of the peripheral and central nervous system and of most appendages. many of these functions are essential for normal male courtship behavior and fertility. two enhancers regulate the development of the penis, claspers and posterior lobes of male genitalia. three enhancers, two of which overlap, control the development of chemosensory bristles in the labellum, legs and wings, some or all of which are required for the transmission of gustatory signals elicited by female pheromones. an additional enhancer regulates in the developing brain the connectivity of two specific neuronal clusters entrusted with processing olfactory pheromone signals from the antennal nerve. finally, functions crucial for the ability of the male to copulate depend on an enhancer that activates pox neuro expression in the embryonic ventral cord. in addition to these male courtship and fertility functions of pox neuro, we have identified enhancers that regulate: (1) proper segmentation of tarsal segments in the leg disc and in homologous segments of the antennal disc; and (2) proper development of the wing hinge and hence the ability of the fly to fly.

the drosophila somatic sex-determination regulatory pathway has been well studied, but little is known about the target genes that it ultimately controls. in a differential screen for sex-specific transcripts expressed in fly heads, we identified a highly male-enriched transcript encoding takeout, a protein related to a superfamily of factors that bind small lipophilic molecules. we show that sex-specific takeout transcripts derive from fat body tissue closely associated with the adult brain and are dependent on the sex determination genes doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru). the male-specific doublesex and fruitless proteins together activate takeout expression, whereas the female-specific doublesex protein represses takeout independently of fru. when cells that normally express takeout are feminized by expression of the transformer-f protein, male courtship behavior is dramatically reduced, suggesting that male identity in these cells is necessary for behavior. a loss-of-function mutation in the takeout gene reduces male courtship and synergizes with fruitless mutations, suggesting that takeout plays a redundant role with other fru-dependent factors involved in male mating behavior. comparison of takeout sequences to the drosophila genome reveals a family of 20 related secreted factors. expression analysis of a subset of these genes suggests that the takeout gene family encodes multiple factors with sex-specific functions.

the maternal dorsal regulatory gradient initiates the differentiation of several tissues in the early drosophila embryo. whole-genome microarray assays identified as many as 40 new dorsal target genes, which encode a broad spectrum of cell signaling proteins and transcription factors. evidence is presented that a tissue-specific form of the nf-y transcription complex is essential for the activation of gene expression in the mesoderm. tissue-specific enhancers were identified for new dorsal target genes, and bioinformatics methods identified conserved cis-regulatory elements for coordinately regulated genes that respond to similar thresholds of the dorsal gradient. the new dorsal target genes and enhancers represent one of the most extensive gene networks known for any developmental process.

the induction of the dopa decarboxylase gene (ddc) in the epidermis of drosophila at pupariation is a receptor-mediated response to the steroid molting hormone, ecdysone. activity is also dependent on the broad-complex (br-c), an early ecdysone response gene that functions during metamorphosis. br-c encodes a family of zinc-finger protein isoforms, br-c(z1-z4). genetic experiments have shown that the z2 isoform is required for epidermal ddc to reach maximum expression at pupariation. in this paper, we report that br-c regulates ddc expression at two different developmental stages through two different cis-acting regions. at pupariation, br-c acts synergistically with the ecdysone receptor to up-regulate ddc. dnase i foot printing has identified four binding sites of the predominant z2 isoform within a distal regulatory element that is required for maximal ddc activity. the sites share a conserved core sequence with a set of br-c sites that had been mapped previously to within the first ddc intron. using variously deleted ddc genomic regions to drive reporter gene expression in transgenic organisms, we show that the intronic binding sites are required for ddc expression at eclosion. at both pupariation and eclosion, br-c releases ddc from an active silencing mechanism, operating through two distinct cis-acting regions of the ddc genomic domain at these stages. transgenes, bearing a ddc fragment from which one of the cis-acting silencers has been deleted, exhibit beta-galactosidase reporter activity in the epidermal cells prior to the appearance of endogenous ddc. our finding that br-c is required for ddc activation at eclosion is the first evidence to suggest that this important regulator of the early metamorphic events, also regulates target gene expression at the end of metamorphosis.

the adjacent knirps (kni) and knirps-related (knrl) genes encode functionally related zinc finger transcription factors that collaborate to initiate development of the second longitudinal wing vein (l2). kni and knrl are expressed in the third instar larval wing disc in a narrow stripe of cells just anterior to the broad central zone of cells expressing high levels of the related spalt genes. here, we identify a 1.4 kb cis-acting enhancer element from the kni locus that faithfully directs gene expression in the l2 primordium. we find that three independent ri alleles have alterations mapping within the l2-enhancer element and show that two of these observed lesions eliminate the ability of the enhancer element to direct gene expression in the l2 primordium. the l2 enhancer can be subdivided into distinct activation and repression domains. the activation domain mediates the combined action of the general wing activator scalloped and a putative locally provided factor, the activity of which is abrogated by a single nucleotide alteration in the ri(53j) mutant. we also find that misexpression of genes in l2 that are normally expressed in veins other than l2 results in abnormal l2 development. these experiments provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how kni and knrl link ap patterning to morphogenesis of the l2 vein by orchestrating the expression of a selective subset of vein-promoting genes in the l2 primordium.

the way in which spatially patterned cellular identities are generated is a central question of organogenesis. in the case of drosophila heart formation, the cardiac progenitors are specified in precise mesodermal positions, giving rise to multiple cell types in a highly ordered arrangement. here, we study the mechanisms by which positional information conveyed by signaling pathways and a combinatorial code of activating and repressing transcription factors work together to confine the expression of the homeobox gene even-skipped (eve) to a small region of the dorsal mesoderm. by manipulating both expression patterns and binding sites for transcription factors, we show that a complex combination of regulatory activities converge on a single enhancer of eve to generate precisely targeted gene expression within the cardiac mesoderm. in particular, ladybird early (lbe), a homeobox gene expressed adjacent to eve, restricts the positive actions of factors downstream of wingless, decapentaplegic, and ras to generate the eve pattern. mutation of a lbe binding site causes dramatic expansion of expression and abolishes the responsiveness to repression by lbe. conversely, eliminating eve in the mesoderm expands lbe expression into the normal eve-expressing territory, suggesting that mutual repression between eve and lbe is essential for delineating the spatial patterns of gene expression that specify cell types within the cardiac mesoderm.

e2f proteins control cell cycle progression by predominantly acting as either activators or repressors of transcription. how the antagonizing activities of different e2fs are integrated by cis-acting control regions into a final transcriptional output in an intact animal is not well understood. e2f function is required for normal development in many species, but it is not completely clear for which genes e2f-regulated transcription provides an essential biological function. to address these questions, we have characterized the control region of the drosophila pcna gene. a single e2f binding site within a 100-bp enhancer is necessary and sufficient to direct the correct spatiotemporal program of g1-s-regulated pcna expression during development. this dynamic program requires both e2f-mediated transcriptional activation and repression, which, in drosophila, are thought to be carried out by two distinct e2f proteins. our data suggest that functional antagonism between these different e2f proteins can occur in vivo by competition for the same binding site. an engineered pcna gene with mutated e2f binding sites supports a low level of expression that can partially rescue the lethality of pcna null mutants. thus, e2f regulation of pcna is dispensable for viability, but is nonetheless important for normal drosophila development.

background: it is widely accepted that comparative sequence data can aid the functional annotation of genome sequences; however, the most informative species and features of genome evolution for comparison remain to be determined. results: we analyzed conservation in eight genomic regions (apterous, even-skipped, fushi tarazu, twist, and rhodopsins 1, 2, 3 and 4) from four drosophila species (d. erecta, d. pseudoobscura, d. willistoni, and d. littoralis) covering more than 500 kb of the d. melanogaster genome. all d. melanogaster genes (and 78-82% of coding exons) identified in divergent species such as d. pseudoobscura show evidence of functional constraint. addition of a third species can reveal functional constraint in otherwise non-significant pairwise exon comparisons. microsynteny is largely conserved, with rearrangement breakpoints, novel transposable element insertions, and gene transpositions occurring in similar numbers. rates of amino-acid substitution are higher in uncharacterized genes relative to genes that have previously been studied. conserved non-coding sequences (cncss) tend to be spatially clustered with conserved spacing between cncss, and clusters of cncss can be used to predict enhancer sequences. conclusions: our results provide the basis for choosing species whose genome sequences would be most useful in aiding the functional annotation of coding and cis-regulatory sequences in drosophila. furthermore, this work shows how decoding the spatial organization of conserved sequences, such as the clustering of cncss, can complement efforts to annotate eukaryotic genomes on the basis of sequence conservation alone.

the drosophila circadian oscillator consists of interlocked period (per)/timeless (tim) and clock (clk) transcriptional/translational feedback loops. within these feedback loops, clk and cycle (cyc) activate per and tim transcription at the same time as they repress clk transcription, thus controlling the opposite cycling phases of these transcripts. clk-cyc directly bind e box elements to activate transcription, but the mechanism of clk-cyc-dependent repression is not known. here we show that a clk-cyc-activated gene, vrille (vri), encodes a repressor of clk transcription, thereby identifying vri as a key negative component of the clk feedback loop in drosophila's circadian oscillator. the blue light photoreceptor encoding cryptochrome (cry) gene is also a target for vri repression, suggesting a broader role for vri in the rhythmic repression of output genes that cycle in phase with clk.

an understanding of the logic of odor perception requires a functional analysis of odor-evoked patterns of activity in neural assemblies in the brain. we have developed a sensitive imaging system in the drosophila brain that couples two-photon microscopy with the specific expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, g-camp. at natural odor concentration, each odor elicits a distinct and sparse spatial pattern of activity in the antennal lobe that is conserved in different flies. patterns of glomerular activity are similar upon imaging of sensory and projection neurons, suggesting the faithful transmission of sensory input to higher brain centers. finally, we demonstrate that the response pattern of a given glomerulus is a function of the specificity of a single odorant receptor. the development of this imaging system affords an opportunity to monitor activity in defined neurons throughout the fly brain with high sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution.

dopamine (da) is the only catecholaminergic neurotransmitter in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster. dopaminergic neurons have been identified in the larval and adult central nervous system (cns) in drosophila and other insects, but no specific genetic tool was available to study their development, function, and degeneration in vivo. in drosophila as in vertebrates, the rate-limiting step in da biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (th). the drosophila th gene (dth) is specifically expressed in all dopaminergic cells and the corresponding mutant, pale (ple), is embryonic lethal. we have performed ple rescue experiments with modified dth transgenes. our results indicate that partially redundant regulatory elements located in dth introns are required for proper expression of this gene in the cns. based on this study, we generated a gal4 driver transgene, th-gal4, containing regulatory sequences from the dth 5' flanking and downstream coding regions. th-gal4 specifically expresses in dopaminergic cells in embryos, larval cns, and adult brain when introduced into the drosophila genome. as a first application of this driver, we observed that in vivo inhibition of da release induces a striking hyperexcitability behavior in adult flies. we propose that th-gal4 will be useful for studies of the role of da in behavior and disease models in drosophila.

the drosophila germline lineage depends on a complex microenvironment of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate the self-renewing and asymmetric divisions of dedicated stem cells. germline stem cells (gscs) must express components of the dpp cassette and the translational repressors nanos and pumilio, whereas cystoblasts require the bam and bgcn genes. bam is especially attractive as a target of gsc differentiation factors because current evidence indicates that bam is both necessary and sufficient for cystoblast differentiation. in this paper, we have sought to distinguish between mutually exclusive transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms as the primary regulators of bam expression in gscs and cystoblasts. we find that bam transcription is active in young germ cells but is repressed specifically in gscs. activation depends on a 50 bp fragment that carries at least one germ cell-specific enhancer element. a non-overlapping 18 bp sequence carries a transcriptional silencer that prevents bam expression in the gsc. promoters lacking this silencer cause bam expression in the gsc and concomitant gsc loss. thus, asymmetry of the gsc division can be reduced to identifying the mechanism that selectively activates the silencer element in gscs.

the drosophila circadian clock consists of two interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. in one loop, dclock/cycle activates period expression, and period protein then inhibits dclock/cycle activity. dclock is also rhythmically transcribed, but its regulators are unknown. vrille (vri) and par domain protein 1 (pdp1) encode related transcription factors whose expression is directly activated by dclock/cycle. we show here that vri and pdp1 proteins feed back and directly regulate dclock expression. repression of dclock by vri is separated from activation by pdp1 since vri levels peak 3-6 hours before pdp1. rhythmic vri transcription is required for molecular rhythms, and here we show that the clock stops in a pdp1 null mutant, identifying pdp1 as an essential clock gene. thus, vri and pdp1, together with dclock itself, comprise a second feedback loop in the drosophila clock that gives rhythmic expression of dclock, and probably of other genes, to generate accurate circadian rhythms.

we use the drosophila melanogaster larval hematopoietic system as an in vivo model for the genetic and functional genomic analysis of oncogenic cell overproliferation. ras regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes. to further elucidate the role of activated ras in cell overproliferation, we generated a collagen promoter-gal4 strain to overexpress ras(v12) in drosophila hemocytes. activated ras causes a dramatic increase in the number of circulating larval hemocytes (blood cells), which is caused by cellular overproliferation. this phenotype is mediated by the raf/mapk pathway. the mutant hemocytes retain the ability to phagocytose bacteria as well as to differentiate into lamellocytes. microarray analysis of hemocytes overexpressing ras(v12) vs. ras(+) identified 279 transcripts that are differentially expressed threefold or more in hemocytes expressing activated ras. this work demonstrates that it will be feasible to combine genetic and functional genomic approaches in the drosophila hematopoietic system to systematically identify oncogene-specific downstream targets.

we investigate how the molecular and cellular maps of the drosophila olfactory system are integrated. a correspondence is established between individual odor receptors, neurons, and odors. we describe the expression of the or22a and or22b receptor genes, show localization to dendritic membranes, and find sexual dimorphism. or22a maps to the ab3a neuron, which responds to ethyl butyrate. analysis of a deletion mutant lacking or22a, along with transgenic rescue experiments, confirms the mapping and demonstrates that an or gene is required for olfactory function in vivo. ectopic expression of or47a in a mutant cell identifies the neuron from which it derives and its odor ligands. ectopic expression in a wild-type cell shows that two receptors can function in a single cell. the ab3a neuron does not depend on normal odor receptor gene expression to navigate to its target in the cns.

yan is a nuclear dna-binding protein that acts as a general inhibitor of cellular differentiation and proliferation in drosophila melanogaster. the genetic and biochemical mechanisms required for regulating yan protein function are well understood, however, the molecular mechanism of yan gene transcriptional regulation has not been fully elucidated. here we show that the dynamic expression of the yan gene is specified by distinct spatial and temporal cis-acting regulatory elements in embryos and larval tissues. each of these distinct elements is thus capable of replicating vital aspects of endogenous yan gene expression.

the proteasome regulator reg (pa28gamma) is a conserved complex present in metazoan nuclei and is able to stimulate the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome in a non-atp dependent manner. however, the in vivo function for reggamma in metazoan cells is currently unknown. to understand the role of drosophila reggamma we have attempted to identify the type of promoter elements regulating its transcription. mapping the site of the transcription initiation revealed a tata-less promoter, and a sequence search identified elements found typically in drosophila genes involved in cell cycle progression and dna replication. in order to test the relevance of the motifs, reggamma transcriptional assays were carried out with mutations in the proposed promoter. our results indicate that a single drosophila replication-related element sequence, dre, is essential for reggamma transcription. to confirm that reggamma has a role in cell cycle progression, the effect of removing reggamma from s2 cells was tested using rna interference. drosophila cells depleted of reggamma showed partial arrests in g1/s cell cycle transition. immuno-staining of drosophila embryos revealed that reggamma is typically localized to the nucleus during embryogenesis with increased levels present in invaginating cells during gastrulation. the reggamma was found dispersed throughout the cell volume within mitotic domains undergoing cell division. finally, database searches suggest that the dre system may regulate key members of the proteasome system in drosophila.

cis-regulatory modules (crms) are transcription regulatory dna segments (approximately 1 kb range) that control the expression of developmental genes in higher eukaryotes. we analyzed clustering of known binding motifs for transcription factors (tfs) in over 60 known crms from 20 drosophila developmental genes, and we present evidence that each type of recognition motif forms significant clusters within the regulatory regions regulated by the corresponding tf. we demonstrate how a search with a single binding motif can be applied to explore gene regulatory networks and to discover coregulated genes in the genome. we also discuss the potential of the clustering method in interpreting the differential response of genes to various levels of transcriptional regulators.

morphogen gradients control body pattern by differentially regulating cellular behavior. here, we analyze the molecular events underlying the primary response to the dpp/bmp morphogen in drosophila. throughout development, dpp transduction causes the graded transcriptional downregulation of the brinker (brk) gene. we first provide significance for the brk expression gradient by showing that different brk levels repress distinct combinations of wing genes expressed at different distances from dpp-secreting cells. we then dissect the brk regulatory region and identify two separable elements with opposite properties, a constitutive enhancer and a dpp morphogen-regulated silencer. furthermore, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that the brk silencer serves as a direct target for a protein complex consisting of the smad homologs mad/medea and the zinc finger protein schnurri. together, our results provide the molecular framework for a mechanism by which the extracellular dpp/bmp morphogen establishes a finely tuned, graded read-out of transcriptional repression.

insect growth and metamorphosis is punctuated by molts, during which a new cuticle is produced. every molt culminates in ecdysis, the shedding of the remains of the old cuticle. both the timing of ecdysis relative to the molt and the actual execution of this vital insect behavior are under peptidergic neuronal control. based on studies in the moth, manduca sexta, it has been postulated that the neuropeptide crustacean cardioactive peptide (ccap) plays a key role in the initiation of the ecdysis motor program. we have used drosophila bearing targeted ablations of ccap neurons (ccap ko animals) to investigate the role of ccap in the execution and circadian regulation of ecdysis. ccap ko animals showed specific defects at ecdysis, yet the severity and nature of the defects varied at different developmental stages. the majority of ccap ko animals died at the pupal stage from the failure of pupal ecdysis, whereas larval ecdysis and adult eclosion behaviors showed only subtle defects. interestingly, the most severe failure seen at eclosion appeared to be in a function required for abdominal inflation, which could be cardioactive in nature. although ccap ko populations exhibited circadian eclosion rhythms, the daily distribution of eclosion events (i.e., gating) was abnormal. effects on the execution of ecdysis and its circadian regulation indicate that ccap is a key regulator of the behavior. nevertheless, an unexpected finding of this work is that the primary functions of ccap as well as its importance in the control of ecdysis behaviors may change during the postembryonic development of drosophila.

the genetic analysis of spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster has led to the identification of several genes that control the onset of meiosis, spermatid differentiation, or both. we described two tightly linked and nearly identical homeobox genes of the tgif (tg-interacting factor) subclass called vismay and achintya that are essential for spermatogenesis in drosophila. in flies deficient for both genes, spermatogenesis is blocked prior to any spermatid differentiation and before the first meiotic division. this suggests that vismay and achintya function at the same step as two previously characterized meiotic arrest genes, always early and cookie monster. consistent with this idea, both always early and cookie monster are still expressed in flies deficient in vismay and achintya. conversely, vismay and achintya proteins are present in always early mutant testes. co-immunoprecipitation experiments further suggest that vismay and achintya proteins exist in a complex with always early and cookie monster proteins. because vismay and achintya are likely to be sequence-specific dna binding factors, these results suggest that they help to specify the spermatogenesis program by recruiting or stabilizing always early and cookie monster to specific target genes that need to be transcriptionally regulated during testes development.

a dna replication-related element (dre)-binding factor (dref) has been revealed to be an important transcription factor for activating promoters of cell proliferation and differentiation related genes. the amino acid sequences of dref are conserved in evolutionary separate drosophila species, drosophila melanogaster (dm) and drosophila virilis (dv) in three regions. in the present study, evidence was obtained that there are several highly conserved regions in the 5' flanking region between the dmdref and dvdref genes. band mobility shift assays using oligonucleotides corresponding to these conserved regions revealed that specific trans-acting factors can bind to at least three regions -554 to -543 (5'-tttgttcttgcg), -81 to -70 (5'-gcccacgtggct) and +225 to +234 (5'-gcaatcagtg). using a transient luciferase expression assay, we demonstrated that the region -554 to -543 functions as a negative regulatory element for dmdref promoter activity, while the regions -77 to -70 (5'-acgtggct) and +225 to +236 (5'-gcaatcagtgtt) function as positive regulatory elements. in previous studies, we observed that expression of the homeodomain protein zerknüllt (zen) represses pcna gene transcription, by reducing the dna binding activity of dref. here we show zen downregulates dref gene promoter activity through action on the region between +241 and +254 (5'-agaatactcaaca). in addition, the dmdref promoter contains five dres. using a double stranded rna-mediated interference method, we generated evidence that expression of dmdref could be auto-regulated by dref through the third dre located at +211 to +218. in living flies we obtained results consistent with those obtained in vitro and in cultured cells. the study thus indicates that dmdref is effectively regulated via highly conserved regions between the dmdref and dvdref promoters, suggesting the existence of common regulatory factors, and that dmdref can be positively regulated by itself via the third dre located in its most highly conserved region.

the drosophila compound eye consists of approximately 750 independently functioning ommatidia, each containing two photoreceptor subpopulations. the outer photoreceptors participate in motion detection, while the inner photoreceptors contribute to color vision. although the inner photoreceptors, r7 and r8, terminally differentiate into functionally related cells, they differ in their molecular and morphological makeup. our data indicates that several aspects of r7 versus r8 cell fate determination are regulated by the transcription factor prospero (pros). pros is specifically expressed in r7 cells, and r7 cells mutant for pros derepress r8 rhodopsins, lose r7 rhodopsins and acquire an r8-like morphology. this suggests that r7 inner photoreceptor cell fate is acquired from a default r8-like fate that is regulated, in part, via the direct transcriptional repression of r8 rhodopsins in r7 cells. furthermore, this study provides transcriptional targets for pros that may lend insight into its role in regulating neuronal development in flies and vertebrates.

the many types of insect ear share a common sensory element, the chordotonal organ, in which sound-induced antennal or tympanal vibrations are transmitted to ciliated sensory neurons and transduced to receptor potentials. however, the molecular identity of the transducing ion channels in chordotonal neurons, or in any auditory system, is still unknown. drosophila that are mutant for nompc, a transient receptor potential (trp) superfamily ion channel, lack receptor potentials and currents in tactile bristles but retain most of the antennal sound-evoked response, suggesting that a different channel is the primary transducer in chordotonal organs. here we describe the drosophila nanchung (nan) protein, an ion channel subunit similar to vanilloid-receptor-related (trpv) channels of the trp superfamily. nan mediates hypo-osmotically activated calcium influx and cation currents in cultured cells. it is expressed in vivo exclusively in chordotonal neurons and is localized to their sensory cilia. antennal sound-evoked potentials are completely absent in mutants lacking nan, showing that it is an essential component of the chordotonal mechanotransducer.

in drosophila, the homologue of the proto-oncogene myc is a key regulator of both cell size and cell growth. the identities and roles of dmyc target genes in these processes, however, remain largely unexplored. here, we investigate the function of the modulo (mod) gene, which encodes a nucleolus localized protein. in gain of function or loss of function experiments, we demonstrate that mod is directly controlled by dmyc. strikingly, in proliferative imaginal cells, mod loss-of-function impairs both cell growth and cell size, whereas larval endoreplicative tissues grow normally. in contrast to dmyc, over-expressing mod in wing imaginal discs is not sufficient to induce cell growth. taken together, our results indicate that mod does not possess the full spectrum of dmyc activities, but is required selectively in proliferative cells to sustain their growth and to maintain their specific size.

the expression and organization of the phototransduction signaling proteins into a specialized light-sensing organelle, the rhabdomere, is required for photoreceptor cells to detect light. we report the characterization of the mutant pph13(hazy). pph13 is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed only in photoreceptor cells. pph13 expression correlates with the differentiation and not specification of photoreceptor cells. in agreement with its expression profile, we find pph13 is required for both rhabdomere morphogenesis and for the proper detection of light. in addition, we demonstrate that pph13 exerts its effect by the regulation of photoreceptor specific gene expression.

long-range enhancer-promoter interactions are commonly seen in complex genetic loci such as hox genes and globin genes. in the case of the drosophila antennapedia complex, the t1 enhancer bypasses the neighboring ftz gene and interacts with the distant scr promoter to activate expression in posterior head segments. previous studies identified a 450-bp promoter-proximal sequence, the tethering element, which is essential for t1-scr interactions. to obtain a more comprehensive view of how individual enhancers selectively interact with appropriate target genes, we used bioinformatic methods to identify new cis-regulatory dnas in the approximately 50-kb scr-antp interval. three previously uncharacterized regulatory elements were identified: a distal t1 tethering sequence mapping >40 kb from the proximal tethering sequence, a repressor element that excludes activation of scr by inappropriate enhancers, and a new ftz enhancer that directs expression within the limits of stripes 1 and 5. many of the regulatory dnas in the scr-antp interval are transcribed, including the proximal and distal tethering elements. we suggest that homotypic interactions between the tethering elements stabilize long-range t1-scr interactions during development.

comparison between the inputs of photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivities is required for color vision. in drosophila, this is achieved in each ommatidium by the inner photoreceptors r7 and r8. two classes of ommatidia are distributed stochastically in the retina: 30% contain uv-rh3 in r7 and blue-rh5 in r8, while the remaining 70% contain uv-rh4 in r7 and green-rh6 in r8. we show here that the distinction between the rhodopsins expressed in the two classes of ommatidia depends on a series of highly conserved homeodomain binding sites present in the rhodopsin promoters. the homeoprotein orthodenticle acts through these sites to activate rh3 and rh5 in their specific ommatidial subclass and through the same sites to prevent rh6 expression in outer photoreceptors. therefore, otd is a key player in the terminal differentiation of subtypes of photoreceptors by regulating rhodopsin expression, a function reminiscent of the role of one of its mammalian homologs, crx, in eye development.

to characterize the features of jak/stat signaling in drosophila immune response, we have identified tota as a gene that is regulated by the jak/stat pathway in response to septic injury. we show that septic injury triggers the hemocyte-specific expression of upd3, a gene encoding a novel upd-like cytokine that is necessary for the jak/stat-dependent activation of tota in the drosophila counterpart of the mammalian liver, the fat body. in addition, we demonstrate that tota activation also requires the nf-kb-like relish pathway, indicating that fat body cells integrate the activity of nf-kb and jak/stat signaling pathways upon immune response. this study reveals that, in addition to the pattern recognition receptor-mediated nf-kb-dependent immune response, drosophila undergoes a complex systemic response that is mediated by the production of cytokines in blood cells, a process that is similar to the acute phase response in mammals.

the 205-kd microtubule-associated protein (205k map) is one of the principal maps in drosophila. 205k map is similar to the hela 210k/map4 family of maps since it shares the following biochemical properties: it is present in several isoforms, has a molecular mass of approximately 200 kd, and is thermostable. furthermore, immuno-crossreactivity has been observed between mouse map4, hela 210k, and drosophila 205k map. currently, there is little information concerning the biological function of this group of nonmotor maps. we have used a classical genetic approach to try to identify the role of the 205k map in drosophila by isolating mutations in the 205k map gene. an f2 lethal screen was used to acquire deficiencies of 100ef, the chromosomal location of the 205k map gene. drosophila bearing a homozygous deficiency for the 205k map region are fully viable and show no obvious phenotype. a recently developed polymerase chain reaction screen was also used to recover five p-element insertions upstream from the 205k map gene. western blot analysis has shown that these insertions result in hypomorphic mutations of the 205k map gene. as was seen with animals that have no 205k map, these mutations appear to have no phenotype. these data unambiguously demonstrate that the 205k map gene is inessential for development. these results also suggest that there may exist protein(s) with redundant function that can substitute for 205k map.

rhomboid (rho) encodes a putative transmembrane receptor that is required for the differentiation of the ventral epidermis. it is initially expressed before the completion of cellularization in lateral stripes within the presumptive neuroectoderm. here, we present evidence that the maternal morphogen dorsal (dl) acts in concert with basic helix-loop-helix (b-hlh) proteins, possibly including twist (twi), to activate rho in both lateral and ventral regions. expression is blocked in ventral regions (the presumptive mesoderm) by snail (sna), which is also a direct target of the dl morphogen. a 300-bp region of the rho promoter (the nee), which is sufficient for neuroectoderm expression, contains a cluster of dl and b-hlh activator sites that are closely linked to sna repressor sites. mutations in these binding sites cause genetically predicted changes in the levels and limits of rho expression. in particular, the disruption of sna-binding sites causes a derepression of the pattern throughout ventral regions, providing evidence that sna is directly responsible for establishing the mesoderm/neuroectoderm boundary before gastrulation. the tight linkage of activator and repressor sites in the rho nee is similar to the arrangement of binding sites observed in the even-skipped stripe 2 element, which is regulated by bicoid (bcd). this suggests that the dl and bcd morphogens use a similar mechanism to make stripes in the drosophila embryo.

in an effort to determine how crude gradients of transcriptional activators and repressors specify sharp stripes of gene expression in the early embryo, we have conducted a detailed study of even-skipped (eve) stripe 2. a combination of promoter fusions and p-transformation assays were used to show that a 480 bp region of the eve promoter is both necessary and sufficient to direct a stripe of lacz expression within the limits of the endogenous eve stripe 2. the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd) and the gap proteins hunchback (hb), kruppel (kr) and giant (gt) all bind with high affinity to closely linked sites within this small promoter element. activation appears to depend on cooperative interactions among bcd and hb proteins, since disrupting single binding sites cause catastrophic reductions in expression. gt is directly involved in the formation of the anterior border, although additional repressors may participate in this process. forming the posterior border of the stripe involves a delicate balance between limiting amounts of the bcd activator and the kr repressor. we propose that the clustering of activator and repressor binding sites in the stripe 2 element is required to bring these weakly interacting regulatory factors into close apposition so that they can function both cooperatively and synergistically to control transcription.

the mechanisms that generate precise patterns of discrete cell types within developing fields are not well understood. one model for analyzing how cells interpret positional information in two dimensions is the regulation of proneural cluster formation within insect segments. two adjacent proneural regulatory genes, achaete and scute, are expressed coincidently in cell clusters at reproducible anteroposterior (ap) and dorsoventral (dv) coordinates within the drosophila embryo from which single neuroblasts later arise. here, we show that the ap and dv position of these clusters is regulated through a common cis-acting region between the genes under the initial control of the products of the pair-rule and dv polarity genes and is later maintained by selected segment polarity genes. the combination of proneural gene activation/repression in ap stripes and repression within specific dv domains positions each cluster of achaete/scute expressing cells within segments; interactions between these cells then determine individual cell fates.

parasegmental boundaries in the drosophila embryo are delimited by the products of the fushi tarazu (ftz) and even-skipped (eve) genes. we show here that these act through particular key control regions of the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) to generate ftz- or eve-like stripe patterns of beta-galactosidase expression. footprint analysis and tests in transformed embryos of constructs bearing mutated footprint regions suggest that ftz protein acts directly as a transcriptional activator of ubx. its activity outside the ubx expression domain is suppressed by hunchback (hb), a repressor of ubx. some dna binding sites for ftz protein are adjacent to, others overlap binding sites for hb protein, and we provide evidence that ftz protein competes with hb protein for dna binding and/or for transcriptional activation. this competition mechanism results in a sharp anterior expression boundary. direct activation of homeotic gene control regions by ftz (or eve) protein may be a regulatory step which is generally used to align expression of homeotic genes with parasegmental boundaries.

homeotic genes encode transcription factors that are thought to specify segmental identity by regulating expression of subordinate genes. limb development is repressed in the abdominal segments of the drosophila embryo by the hometic genes of the bithorax complex (bx-c). localized expression of the homeobox gene distal-less (dii) is required for leg development in thoracic segments. we have identified a minimal cis-regulatory enhancer element that directs dii expression in the larval leg primordia. we present evidence that the bx-c proteins repress dii expression in abdominal segments by binding to a small number of specific sites in this element. mutating these sites eliminates bx-c protein binding and renders the element insensitive to bx-c-mediated repression in vivo. repression of limb development in the abdomen appears to be controlled at the dii enhancer. thus dii may serve as a downstream target gene through which the homeotic genes control abdominal segment identity in the drosophila embryo.

we dissected an upstream control region (a bxd fragment) from the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) of drosophila which confers a ubx-like expression pattern in the embryonic ectoderm. we found several distinct enhancer elements spread through the whole bxd fragment each of which is active in transformed embryos, mediating a different pattern of beta-galactosidase expression in the ventral nerve cord. the strongest of these patterns mimics ubx expression within the ubx domain. this pattern is strictly dependent on ubx function. thus, the bxd control region contains a ubx response element, suggesting that positive autoregulation of ubx may occur in the central nervous system of the developing embryo.

extracellular signal proteins induce the homeotic gene labial (lab) to high levels of localised expression in the endoderm of drosophila embryos. we aimed to identify cis-regulatory elements within the lab gene that respond to this induction by analysing the activity of stably integrated reporter gene constructs. dissection of lab 5' flanking sequences reveals two types of response elements. one of these mediates lab dependent activity, providing evidence that lab induction in the endoderm is autoregulatory. the other element, to a large extent independent of lab function, responds to decapentaplegic (dpp), a signal molecule related to mammalian tgf-beta. our evidence suggests that lab induction in the endoderm reflects coordinate action of two distinct factors one of which may be lab protein itself, and another whose localised activity or expression in the midgut depends on the dpp signal.

beta 3 tubulin expression accompanies the specification and differentiation of the drosophila mesoderm. the genetic programs involved in these processes are largely unknown. our previous studies on the regulation of the beta 3 tubulin gene have shown that upstream sequences guide the expression in the somatic musculature, while regulatory elements in the first intron are necessary for expression in the visceral musculature. to further analyse this mode of regulation, which reflects an early embryonic specification program, we undertook a more detailed analysis of the regulatory capabilities of the intron. the results reveal not only a certain degree of redundancy in the cis-acting elements, which act at different developmental stages in the same mesodermal derivatives, but they also demonstrate in the visceral mesoderm, which forms a continuous epithelium along the body axis of the embryo, an early action of regulators guiding gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo: an enhancer element in the intron leads to expression in a subdomain restricted along the anterior-posterior axis. this pattern is altered in mutants in the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx), whereas ectopic ubx expression leads to activity of the enhancer in the entire visceral mesoderm. so this element is likely to be a target of homeotic genes, which would define the beta 3 tubulin gene as a realisator gene under the control of selector genes.

the homeotic genes of drosophila encode transcription factors that specify morphological differences between segments. to identify the genes that they control, we developed a chromatin immunopurification approach designed to isolate in vivo binding sites for the products of the homeotic gene ultrabithorax. here, we report the analysis of one immunopurified binding site. this 110 bp fragment maps within a regulatory region of a gene under homeotic control, connectin. a 4 kb dna fragment, including the immunopurified binding site, is sufficient to reproduce the appropriate homeotic control within a subset of the full tissue distribution of connectin. analysis of the role of the 110 bp binding site indicates that it mediates transcriptional controls by ultrabithorax and other homeotic genes. this is the first report of a functional in vivo binding site isolated using the chromatin immunopurification method. we also show that the protein product of the connectin gene is predicted to be a cell-surface molecule containing leucine-rich repeats. the protein, connectin, can mediate cell-cell adhesion thus suggesting a direct link between homeotic gene function and processes of cell-cell recognition.

diptericins are 9 kda inducible antibacterial peptides initially isolated from immune haemolymph of phormia (diptera). following the isolation of a drosophila cdna encoding a diptericin homologue, we have now cloned a genomic fragment containing the drosophila diptericin gene. to dissect the regulation of this gene, we have transformed flies with a fusion gene in which the reporter beta-galactosidase gene is under the control of 2.2 kb upstream sequences of the diptericin gene. we show that such a fusion gene is inducible by injection of live bacteria or complete freund's adjuvant and respects the tissue specific expression pattern of the resident diptericin gene. our analysis reveals at least four distinct phases in the regulation of this gene: young larvae, late third instar larvae, pupae and adults. this complexity may be related to the presence in the upstream sequences of multiple copies of response elements previously characterized in genes encoding acute phase response proteins in mammals (e.g. nk-kappa b, nf-kappa b related, nf-il6 response elements).

we have analyzed the cis-regulatory elements in the 5' flanking region of the drosophila choline acetyltransferase gene (chat, e.c.2.3.1.6). dna fragments were fused to the escherichia coli lacz reporter gene and introduced into the drosophila germ line by p-element-mediated transformation. a 7.4 kb 5' flanking sequence directed beta-galactosidase expression in the adult optic lobes and other well-defined cns structures with a pattern very similar to the distribution of endogenous chat protein. in contrast, the proximal 3.3 kb and 1.2 kb of 5' flanking dna directed lacz expression in only selected subsets of the structures seen with the 7.4 kb lacz construct. our results indicate that both qualitative and quantitative regulatory elements are present in the 5' flanking dna and that these elements distinguish various subsets of cholinergic neurons. we have also fused the same 5' flanking dna sequences to wild-type chat cdna and used these constructs to transform chatsl mutant flies. not only the 7.4 kb cdna construct, but also the 3.3 and 1.2 kb constructs, rescued chatsl from temperature-dependent paralysis and adult lethality, indicating that the regulatory information in any of these genomic fragments can drive sufficient wild-type chat expression to overcome these mutant phenotypes.

glial expression of the drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene (ddc) is repressed by a regulatory region located approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. we have used in vitro mutagenesis and germ line transformation to determine which elements within the ddc promoter mediate repression. our evidence suggests that the hypodermal cell activator elements iia and iib play a major role in the transcriptional regulation of ddc in glial cells. a variety of mutations demonstrate that element iia is a strong glial activator element and that element iib is necessary for glial repression. although these two regulatory elements are nearly identical in sequence, our data suggest that they are not redundant. altering the wild-type number and spacing of elements iia and iib indicates that the wild-type arrangement of this repeat is critical for repression. we conclude that these key elements of the ddc promoter regulate both activation and repression in glia.

hox proteins play fundamental roles in generating pattern diversity during development and evolution, acting in broad domains but controlling localized cell diversification and pattern. much remains to be learned about how hox selector proteins generate cell-type diversity. in this study, regulatory specificity was investigated by dissecting the genetic and molecular requirements that allow the hox protein abdominal a to activate wingless in only a few cells of its broad expression domain in the drosophila visceral mesoderm. we show that the dpp/tgfbeta signal controls abdominal a function, and that hox protein and signal-activated regulators converge on a wingless enhancer. the signal, acting through mad and creb, provides spatial information that subdivides the domain of abdominal a function through direct combinatorial action, conferring specificity and diversity upon abdominal a activity.

during germ band elongation, widespread decapentaplegic (dpp) expression in the dorsal ectoderm patterns the underlying mesoderm. these dpp signals specify cardial and pericardial cell fates in the developing heart. at maximum germ band extension, dpp dorsal ectoderm expression becomes restricted to the dorsal-most or leading edge cells (le). a second round of dpp signaling then specifies cell shape changes in ectodermal cells leading to dorsal closure. here we show that a third round of dpp dorsal ectoderm expression initiates during germ band retraction. this round of dpp expression is also restricted to le cells but dpp signaling specifies the repression of the transcription factor zfh-1 in a subset of pericardial cells in the underlying mesoderm. surprisingly, we found that cis-regulatory sequences that activate the third round of dpp dorsal ectoderm expression are found in the dpp disk region. we also show that the activation of this round of dpp expression is dependent upon prior dpp signals, the signal transducer medea, and possibly release from dtcf-mediated repression. our results demonstrate that a second round of dpp signaling from the dorsal ectoderm to the mesoderm is required to pattern the developing heart and that this round of dpp expression may be activated by combinatorial interactions between dpp and wingless.

recent studies have suggested that drosophila taste receptors are encoded by a family of g protein-coupled receptor genes comprising at least 56 members. one of these genes, gr5a, has been shown by genetic analysis to be required by the fly for behavioral and sensory responses to a sugar, trehalose. here, we show that gr5a is expressed in neurons of taste sensilla located on the labellum and legs. expression is observed in most if not all labellar sensilla and suggests that many taste neurons express more than one receptor. we demonstrate by heterologous expression in a drosophila s2 cell line that gr5a encodes a receptor tuned to trehalose. this is the first functional expression of an invertebrate taste receptor.

we are interested in the mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity within the drosophila central nervous system (cns), and in particular in the development of a single identified motoneuron called rp2. expression of the homeodomain transcription factor even-skipped (eve) is required for rp2 to establish proper connectivity with its muscle target. here we investigate the mechanisms by which eve is specifically expressed within the rp2 motoneuron lineage. within the nb4-2 lineage, expression of eve first occurs in the precursor of rp2, called gmc4-2a. we identify a small 500 base pair eve enhancer that mediates eve expression in gmc4-2a. we show that four different transcription factors (prospero, huckebein, fushi tarazu, and pdm1) are all expressed in gmc4-2a, and are required to activate eve via this minimal enhancer, and that one transcription factor (klumpfuss) represses eve expression via this element. all four positively acting transcription factors act independently, regulating eve but not each other. thus, the eve enhancer integrates multiple positive and negative transcription factor inputs to restrict eve expression to a single precursor cell (gmc4-2a) and its rp2 motoneuron progeny.

the drosophila pax-6 homologs eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy) are expressed in the eyes and in the central nervous system (cns). in addition to the pivotal functions in eye development, previous studies revealed that ey also plays important roles in axonal development of the mushroom bodies, centers for associative learning and memory. it has been reported that a second intron enhancer that contains several pax-6 binding sites mainly controls the eye-specific expression, but the dna sequences that control cns expression are unknown. in this work, we have dissected transcriptional enhancer elements of the ey gene that are required for the cns expression in various developmental stages. we first show that cns expression is independent of the eye-specific enhancer of the second intron. by systematic reporter studies, we have identified several discrete dna elements in the 5' upstream region and in the second intron that cooperatively interact to generate most of the ey expression pattern in the cns. dna sequence comparison between the ey genes of distant drosophila species has identified conserved modules that might be bound by the upstream regulatory factors of the ey gene in cns development. furthermore, by rna interference and mutant studies, we show that ey expression in the brain is independent of the activity of toy and ey itself whereas in the eye primordia it requires both, supporting the notion that ey and toy are regulated by parallel and independent regulatory cascades in brain development.

lozenge (lz) is a multifunctional transcription factor that is activated in a pool of pluripotent cells at the beginning of a wave of morphogenesis during drosophila eye development. lozenge belongs to the runx class of transcription factors that includes the mammalian proteins aml1, runx 2, and runx 3. these proteins allow a tissue-specific precursor population of cells to attain multiple terminally differentiated fates. we investigated the transcriptional control of lz to determine the mechanism by which precursor populations achieve their identity. we have identified a 251-bp region in the second intron of the lz gene that functions as a minimal eye-specific enhancer. we provide evidence that sine oculis and glass are the two major activators of lz expression during eye development. this work establishes a bridge between early eye specification genes and late cell-specific transcription factors required for terminal determination of cone cells in the eye.

the drosophila segmentation gene krüppel (kr) is redeployed to play a critical role for the establishment of the larval visual system. using reporter gene expression conducted by a specific kr cis-acting element, we were able to trace back the origin of the larval photoreceptor organ, the bolwig organ, to a single progenitor neuron and to examine kr function in bolwig organ development when kr+ activity is absent from embryos due to specific mutations or reduced by neuron-specific and temporally restricted kr antisense rna expression. our results show that kr is required for neurons to differentiate into bolwig organs, for fasciculation of the bolwig nerve, and for this nerve to follow a specific pathway toward the synaptic targets in the larval brain. the transcription factor encoded by kr is likely to regulate surface molecules necessary for neuronal cell adhesion and recognition in the developing larval visual system.

we have previously identified and characterized drosophila hemolectin (hml) in the conditioned medium of a drosophila cell line. the deduced amino acids sequence contains a number of domains conserved in human von willebrand factor, coagulation factor v/viii, and complement factors. to characterize hml localization and function, we have established two transgenic lines (hml-gal4 and uas-hmlrnai). by crossing hml-gal4 with uas-egfp, we observed that hml is specifically expressed in embryonic and in larval hemocytes. we determined that hml is expressed in a subpopulation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells but not in lamellocytes. hml rnai larvae are viable and do not display obvious developmental defects under normal conditions. however, they show a bleeding defect upon injury. we confirmed that the failure to seal a wound is not due to a defect in melanin production or in phenoloxidase activity. the expression of antimicrobial peptides was not significantly affected on hml rnai adults. altogether, our data strongly suggest that hml is involved in hemostasis and/or coagulation in drosophila larvae.

during sensory organ precursor (sop) specification, a single cell is selected from a proneural cluster of cells. here, we present evidence that senseless (sens), a zinc-finger transcription factor, plays an important role in this process. we show that sens is directly activated by proneural proteins in the presumptive sops and a few cells surrounding the sop in most tissues. in the cells that express low levels of sens, it acts in a dna-binding-dependent manner to repress transcription of proneural genes. in the presumptive sops that express high levels of sens, it acts as a transcriptional activator and synergizes with proneural proteins. we therefore propose that sens acts as a binary switch that is fundamental to sop selection.

drosophila wing development is a useful model to study organogenesis, which requires the input of selector genes that specify the identity of various morphogenetic fields (weatherbee, s. d. and carroll, s. b. (1999) cell 97, 283-286) and cell signaling molecules. in order to understand how the integration of multiple signaling pathways and selector proteins can be achieved during wing development, we studied the regulatory network that controls the expression of serrate (ser), a ligand for the notch (n) signaling pathway, which is essential for the development of the drosophila wing, as well as vertebrate limbs. here, we show that a 794 bp cis-regulatory element located in the 3' region of the ser gene can recapitulate the dynamic patterns of endogenous ser expression during wing development. using this enhancer element, we demonstrate that apterous (ap, a selector protein), and the notch and wingless (wg) signaling pathways, can sequentially control wing development through direct regulation of ser expression in early, mid and late third instar stages, respectively. in addition, we show that later ser expression in the presumptive vein cells is controlled by the egfr pathway. thus, a cis-regulatory element is sequentially regulated by multiple signaling pathways and a selector protein during drosophila wing development. such a mechanism is possibly conserved in the appendage outgrowth of other arthropods and vertebrates.

the drosophila wings-up a gene encodes troponin i. two regions, located upstream of the transcription initiation site (upstream regulatory element) and in the first intron (intron regulatory element), regulate gene expression in specific developmental and muscle type domains. based on lacz reporter expression in transgenic lines, upstream regulatory element and intron regulatory element yield identical expression patterns. both elements are required for full expression levels in vivo as indicated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. three myocyte enhancer factor-2 binding sites have been functionally characterized in each regulatory element. using exon specific probes, we show that transvection is based on transcriptional changes in the homologous chromosome and that zeste and suppressor of zeste 3 gene products act as repressors for wings-up a. critical regions for transvection and for zeste effects are defined near the transcription initiation site. after in silico analysis in insects (anopheles and drosophila pseudoobscura) and vertebrates (ratus and coturnix), the regulatory organization of drosophila seems to be conserved. troponin i (tni) is expressed before muscle progenitors begin to fuse, and sarcomere morphogenesis is affected by tni depletion as z discs fail to form, revealing a novel developmental role for the protein or its transcripts. also, abnormal stoichiometry among tni isoforms, rather than their absolute levels, seems to cause the functional muscle defects.

"infection results in the rapid activation of immunity genes in the drosophila fat body. two classes of transcription factors have been implicated in this process: the rel-containing proteins, dorsal, dif, and relish, and the gata factor serpent. here we present evidence that rel-gata synergy plays a pervasive role in the immune response. selex assays identified consensus binding sites that permitted the characterization of several immunity regulatory dnas. the distribution of rel and gata sites within these dnas suggests that most or all fat-specific immunity genes contain a common organization of regulatory elements: closely linked rel and gata binding sites positioned in the same orientation and located near the transcription start site. aspects of this ""regulatory code"" are essential for the immune response. these results suggest that immunity regulatory dnas contain constrained organizational features, which may be a general property of eukaryotic enhancers."

in drosophila, glial cell differentiation requires the expression of glial cells missing (gcm) in multiple neural cell lineages, where gcm acts as a binary switch for glial vs. neuronal fate. thus, the primary event controlling gliogenesis in neural progenitors is the transcription of gcm. in addition, gcm is also required for the differentiation of macrophages, and is expressed in the hemocyte lineage. this dual role of gcm in glial cell and blood cell development underscores the need for the precise temporal and spatial regulation of gcm transcription. to understand how gcm transcription is regulated, we have undertaken an analysis of the cis-regulatory dna elements of gcm using lacz reporter activity in transgenic embryos, testing the activity of approximately 35 kilobases of dna from the gcm locus. we have identified several distinct dna regions that promote most of the elements of gcm expression. these include elements for general neural expression, gcm-independent and gcm-dependent glial-specific expression, as well as early and late hemocyte expression. we show that expression of an abdominal glial-specific element is dependent on the homeotic gene abdominal-a. our results indicate that gcm transcription is controlled by a combination of general and lineage-specific elements, positive autoregulation, and neuronal repression.

reactive oxygen species (ros) cause oxidative stress and aging. the catalase gene is a key component of the cellular antioxidant defense network. however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate catalase gene expression are poorly understood. in this study, we have identified a dna replication-related element (dre; 5'-tatcgata) in the 5'-flanking region of the drosophila catalase gene. gel mobility shift assays revealed that a previously identified factor called dref (dre- binding factor) binds to the dre sequence in the drosophila catalase gene. we used site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transient transfection assays to establish that expression of the catalase gene is regulated by dref through the dre site. to explore the role of dre/dref in vivo, we established transgenic flies carrying a catalase-lacz fusion gene with or without mutation in the dre. the beta-galactosidase expression patterns of these reporter transgenic lines demonstrated that the catalase gene is upregulated by dref through the dre sequence. in addition, we observed suppression of the ectopic dref-induced rough eye phenotype by a catalase amorphic cat(n1) allele, indicating that dref activity is modulated by the intracellular redox state. these results indicate that the dre/dref system is a key regulator of catalase gene expression and provide evidence of cross-talk between the dre/dref system and the antioxidant defense system.

the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) transcription factor plays a central role in the activation and maintenance of muscle gene expression in fruit flies and vertebrates. the mechanism of action and downstream target genes of mef2 have been defined in considerable detail, but relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate mef2 expression during muscle development. here we demonstrate that mef2 maintains its own expression in all differentiated muscle cell types during late embryonic and larval development in drosophila by binding a conserved mef2 site in a muscle-specific regulatory enhancer. ectopic expression of mef2 is sufficient to directly activate this enhancer in some, but not all, non-muscle cells. furthermore, activation of the mef2 enhancer normally in muscle cells and ectopically in non-muscle cells is dependent upon the integrity of the mef2 binding site. these findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism whereby mef2 can stabilize the muscle phenotype by sustaining its own expression through a myogenic autoregulatory loop.

the heartless (htl) fgf receptor is required for the differentiation of a variety of mesodermal tissues in the drosophila embryo, yet its ligand is not known. here we identify two new fgf genes, thisbe (ths) and pyramus (pyr), which probably encode the elusive ligands for this receptor. the two genes exhibit dynamic patterns of expression in epithelial tissues adjacent to htl-expressing mesoderm derivatives, including the neurogenic ectoderm, stomadeum, and hindgut. embryos that lack ths+ and pyr+ exhibit defects related to those seen in htl mutants, including delayed mesodermal migration during gastrulation and a loss of cardiac tissues and hindgut musculature. the misexpression of ths in wild-type and mutant embryos suggests that fgf signaling is required for both cell migration and the transcriptional induction of cardiac gene expression. the characterization of htl and ths regulatory dnas indicates that high levels of the maternal dorsal gradient directly activate htl expression, whereas low levels activate ths. it is therefore possible to describe fgf signaling and other aspects of gastrulation as a direct manifestation of discrete threshold readouts of the dorsal gradient.

pattern formation depends on the acquisition of precise cellular identities due to the differential expression of transcription factors. enhancers within regulatory regions integrate the positive and negative regulatory signals directing gene transcription. here, we analyze the enhancer that drives expression of the drosophila gene spalt in the wing blade. this enhancer integrates positive signals, mediated by the decapentaplegic signaling effector protein medea, with the repressor activity of brinker. the enhancer functions in the absence of binding sites for the wing-specific factor scalloped. the molecular analysis of this enhancer indicates that there are additional factors yet unknown involved in the activation of spalt in the wing blade and that the mechanism of repression by brinker does not rely on competition with mad-medea overlapping sites. the comparisons with other enhancers that respond to decapentaplegic suggest that there are different possibilities to integrate the positive and negative inputs triggered by this signaling pathway.

selenophosphate synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of selenophosphate which is a selenium donor for sec biosynthesis. in drosophila melanogaster, there are two types of selenophosphate synthetases designated dsps1 and dsps2, where dsps2 is a selenoprotein. the mechanism of gene expression of dsps2 as well as other selenoproteins in drosophila has not been elucidated. herein, we report an essential regulator system that regulates the transcription of the dsps2 gene (dsps2). through deletion/substitution mutagenesis, the downstream dna replication-related element (dre) located at +71 has been identified as an essential element for dsps2 promoter activity. furthermore, double-stranded rna interference (dsrnai) experiments were performed to ablate transcription factors such as tbp, trf1, trf2 and dref in schneider cells. the dsrnai experiments showed that dsps2 promoter activities in dref- and trf2-depleted cells were significantly decreased by 90% and 50%, respectively. however, the depletion of tbp or trf1 did not affect the expression level of dsps2 even though there is a putative tata box at -20. these results strongly suggest that the dre/dref system controls the basal level of transcription of dsps2 by interacting with trf2.

the sensory organs of the drosophila adult leg provide a simple model system with which to investigate pattern-forming mechanisms. in the leg, a group of small mechanosensory bristles is organized into a series of longitudinal rows, a pattern that depends on periodic expression of the hairy gene (h) and the proneural genes achaete (ac) and scute (sc). expression of ac in longitudinal stripes in prepupal leg discs defines the positions of the mechanosensory bristle rows. the ac/sc expression domains are delimited by the hairy repressor, which is itself periodically expressed. in order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in leg sensory organ patterning, we have analyzed a hedgehog (hh)- and decapentaplegic (dpp)-responsive enhancer of the h gene, which directs expression of h in a narrow stripe in the dorsal leg imaginal disc (the d-h stripe). our studies suggest that the domain of d-h expression is defined by the overlap of hh and high-level dpp signaling. we find that the d-h enhancer consists of a hh-responsive activation element (hhre) and a repression element (repe), which responds to the transcriptional repressor brinker (brk). the hhre directs expression of h in a broad stripe along the anteroposterior (ap) compartment boundary. hhre-directed expression is refined along the ap and dorsoventral axes by brk1, acting through the repe. in d-h-expressing cells, dpp signaling is required to block brk-mediated repression. this study elucidates a molecular mechanism for integration of the hh and dpp signals, and identifies a novel function for brk as a repressor of hh-target genes.

one of the first steps in embryonic mesodermal differentiation is allocation of cells to particular tissue fates. in drosophila, this process of mesodermal subdivision requires regulation of the bhlh transcription factor twist. during subdivision, twist expression is modulated into stripes of low and high levels within each mesodermal segment. high twist levels direct cells to the body wall muscle fate, whereas low levels are permissive for gut muscle and fat body fate. we show that su(h)-mediated notch signaling represses twist expression during subdivision and thus plays a critical role in patterning mesodermal segments. our work demonstrates that notch acts as a transcriptional switch on mesodermal target genes, and it suggests that notch/su(h) directly regulates twist, as well as indirectly regulating twist by activating proteins that repress twist. we propose that notch signaling targets two distinct 'repressors of twist' - the proteins encoded by the enhancer of split complex [e(spl)c] and the hlh gene extra machrochaetae (emc). hence, the patterning of drosophila mesodermal segments relies on notch signaling changing the activities of a network of bhlh transcriptional regulators, which, in turn, control mesodermal cell fate. since this same cassette of notch, su(h) and bhlh regulators is active during vertebrate mesodermal segmentation and/or subdivision, our work suggests a conserved mechanism for notch in early mesodermal patterning.

bioinformatics methods have identified enhancers that mediate restricted expression in the drosophila embryo. however, only a small fraction of the predicted enhancers actually work when tested in vivo. in the present study, co-regulated neurogenic enhancers that are activated by intermediate levels of the dorsal regulatory gradient are shown to contain several shared sequence motifs. these motifs permitted the identification of new neurogenic enhancers with high precision: five out of seven predicted enhancers direct restricted expression within ventral regions of the neurogenic ectoderm. mutations in some of the shared motifs disrupt enhancer function, and evidence is presented that the twist and su(h) regulatory proteins are essential for the specification of the ventral neurogenic ectoderm prior to gastrulation. the regulatory model of neurogenic gene expression defined in this study permitted the identification of a neurogenic enhancer in the distant anopheles genome. we discuss the prospects for deciphering regulatory codes that link primary dna sequence information with predicted patterns of gene expression.

in drosophila, neurons and glial cells are produced by neural precursor cells called neuroblasts (nbs), which can be individually identified. each nb generates a characteristic cell lineage specified by a precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression within the nb and its progeny. here we show that the homeobox genes ladybird early and ladybird late are expressed in subsets of cells deriving from neuroblasts nb 5-3 and nb 5-6 and are essential for their correct development. our analysis revealed that ladybird in drosophila, like their vertebrate orthologous lbx1 genes, play an important role in cell fate specification processes. among those cells that express ladybird are nb 5-6-derived glial cells. in ladybird loss-of-function mutants, the nb 5-6-derived exit glial cells are absent while overexpression of these genes leads to supernumerary glial cells of this type. furthermore, aberrant glial cell positioning and aberrant spacing of axonal fascicles in the nerve roots observed in embryos with altered ladybird function suggest that the ladybird genes might also control directed cell movements and cell-cell interactions within the developing drosophila ventral nerve cord.

proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) proteins initiate neurogenesis in both vertebrates and invertebrates. the drosophila achaete (ac) and scute (sc) proteins are among the first identified members of the large bhlh proneural protein family. phyllopod (phyl), encoding an ubiquitin ligase adaptor, is required for ac- and sc-dependent external sensory (es) organ development. expression of phyl is directly activated by ac and sc. forced expression of phyl rescues es organ formation in ac and sc double mutants. phyl and senseless, encoding a zn-finger transcriptional factor, depend on each other in es organ development. our results provide the first example that bhlh proneural proteins promote neurogenesis through regulation of protein degradation.

adipokinetic hormones (akhs) are metabolic neuropeptides, mediating mobilization of energy substrates from the fat body in many insects. in delving into the roles of the drosophila akh (dakh) gene, its developmental expression patterns were examined and the physiological functions of the akh-producing neurons were investigated using animals devoid of akh neurons and ones with ectopically expressing dakh. the dakh gene is expressed exclusively in the corpora cardiaca from late embryos to adult stages. projections emanating from the akh neurons indicated that akh has multiple target tissues as follows: the prothoracic gland and aorta in the larva and the crop and brain in the adult. studies using transgenic manipulations of the dakh gene demonstrated that akh induced both hypertrehalosemia and hyperlipemia. starved wild-type flies displayed prolonged hyperactivity prior to death; this novel behavioral pattern could be associated with food-searching activities in response to starvation. in contrast, flies devoid of akh neurons not only lacked this type of hyperactivity, but also displayed strong resistance to starvation-induced death. from these findings, we propose another role for akh in the regulation of starvation-induced foraging behavior.

background: discrimination between edible and contaminated foods is crucial for the survival of animals. in drosophila, a family of gustatory receptors (grs) expressed in taste neurons is thought to mediate the recognition of sugars and bitter compounds, thereby controlling feeding behavior. results: we have characterized in detail the expression of eight gr genes in the labial palps, the fly's main taste organ. these genes fall into two distinct groups: seven of them, including gr66a, are expressed in 22 or fewer taste neurons in each labial palp. additional experiments show that many of these genes are coexpressed in partially overlapping sets of neurons. in contrast, gr5a, which encodes a receptor for trehalose, is expressed in a distinct and larger set of taste neurons associated with most chemosensory sensilla, including taste pegs. mapping the axonal targets of cells expressing gr66a and gr5a reveals distinct projection patterns for these two groups of neurons in the brain. moreover, tetanus toxin-mediated inactivation of gr66a- or gr5a-expressing cells shows that these two sets of neurons mediate distinct taste modalities-the perception of bitter (caffeine) and sweet (trehalose) taste, respectively. conclusion: discrimination between two taste modalities-sweet and bitter-requires specific sets of gustatory receptor neurons that express different gr genes. unlike the drosophila olfactory system, where each neuron expresses a single olfactory receptor gene, taste neurons can express multiple receptors and do so in a complex gr gene code that is unique for small sets of neurons.

the caudal-related homeobox transcription factors are required for the normal development and differentiation of intestinal cells. recent reports indicate that misregulation of homeotic gene expression is associated with gastrointestinal cancer in mammals. however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the caudal-related homeobox genes are poorly understood. in this study, we have identified a dna replication-related element (dre) in the 5' flanking region of the drosophila caudal gene. gel-mobility shift analysis reveals that three of the four dre-related sequences in the caudal 5'-flanking region are recognized by the dre-binding factor (dref). deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of these dre sites results in a considerable reduction in caudal gene promoter activity. analyses with transgenic flies carrying a caudal-lacz fusion gene bearing wild-type or mutant dre sites indicate that the dre sites are required for caudal expression in vivo. these findings indicate that dre/dref is a key regulator of drosophila caudal homeobox gene expression and suggest that dres and dref contribute to intestinal development by regulating caudal gene expression.

roughest (rst) is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily with pleiotropic functions during the development of drosophila melanogaster. it has been shown to be involved in cell sorting before apoptosis in the developing compound eye, in fusion processes of embryonic muscle development and in axonal pathfinding. in accordance with its multiple functions, the rst gene shows a dynamic expression pattern throughout the development of drosophila. in order to understand the transcriptional regulation of rst expression we have identified rst cis regulatory sequences in an enhancer detection screen. by dissection of the identified rst cis regulatory sequences we identified several distinct rst regulatory modules. among others these include elements for expression in interommatidial cells of the pupal eye disc at a time when apoptotic decisions are made in these cells and elements for expression in the embryonic mesoderm. the expression of rst in the embryonic mesoderm is regulated by at least two separate modules.

photoreceptor development begins in the larval eye imaginal disc, where eight distinct photoreceptor cells (r1-r8) are sequentially recruited into each of the developing ommatidial clusters. final photoreceptor differentiation, including rhabdomere formation and rhodopsin expression, is completed during pupal life. during pupation, spalt was previously proposed to promote r7 and r8 terminal differentiation. here we show that spalt is required for proper r7 differentiation during the third instar larval stage since the expression of several r7 larval markers (prospero, enhancer of split mdelta0.5, and runt) is lost in spalt mutant clones. in r8, spalt is not required for cell specification or differentiation in the larval disc but promotes terminal differentiation during pupation. we show that spalt is necessary for senseless expression in r8 and sufficient to induce ectopic senseless in r1-r6 during pupation. moreover, misexpression of spalt or senseless is sufficient to induce ectopic rhodopsin 6 expression and partial suppression of rhodopsin 1. we demonstrate that spalt and senseless are part of a genetic network, which regulates rhodopsin 6 and rhodopsin 1. taken together, our results suggest that while spalt is required for r7 differentiation during larval stages, spalt and senseless promote terminal r8 differentiation during pupal stages, including the regulation of rhodopsin expression.

drosophila immune response involves three types of hemocytes ('blood cells'). one cell type, the lamellocyte, is induced to differentiate only under particular conditions, such as parasitization by wasps. here, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying the specification of lamellocytes. we first show that collier (col), the drosophila orthologue of the vertebrate gene encoding early b-cell factor (ebf), is expressed very early during ontogeny of the lymph gland, the larval hematopoietic organ. in this organ, col expression prefigures a specific posterior region recently proposed to act as a signalling centre, the posterior signalling centre (psc). the complete lack of lamellocytes in parasitized col mutant larvae revealed the critical requirement for col activity in specification of this cell type. in wild-type larvae, col expression remains restricted to the psc following parasitization, despite the massive production of lamellocytes. we therefore propose that col endows psc cells with the capacity to relay an instructive signal that orients hematopoietic precursors towards the lamellocyte fate in response to parasitization. considered together with the role of ebf in lymphopoiesis, these findings suggest new parallels in cellular immunity between drosophila and vertebrates. further investigations on col/ebf expression and function in other phyla should provide fresh insight into the evolutionary origin of lymphoid cells.

the drosophila snail gene is required for proper mesodermal development. genetic studies suggest that it functions by repressing adjacent ectodermal gene expression including that of the single-minded (sim) gene. the snail gene encodes a protein with a zinc-finger motif, and here we report that the snail gene product is a sequence-specific dna binding protein. the snail protein recognizes a 14-base-pair consensus sequence that is found nine times in a 2.8-kilobase sim regulatory region. these results provide evidence for the direct control of sim transcription by snail.

to understand the function and evolution of genes with complex patterns of expression, such as the drosophila wingless gene, it is essential to know how their transcription is regulated. however, extracting the relevant regulatory information from a genome is still a complex task. we used a combination of comparative genomics and functional approaches to identify putative regulatory sequences in two introns (1 and 3) of the wingless gene and to infer their evolution. comparison of the sequences obtained from several drosophila species revealed colinear and well-conserved sequence blocks in both introns. drosophila willistoni showed a rate of evolution, in both introns, faster than expected from its phylogenetic position. intron 3 appeared to be composed of two separate modules, one of them lost in the willistoni group. we tested whether sequence conservation in noncoding regions is a reliable indicator of regulatory function and, if this function is conserved, by analyzing d. melanogaster transgenic reporter lines harboring intron 3 sequences from d. melanogaster (sophophora subgenus) and the species from the drosophila subgenus presenting the most divergent sequence, d. americana. the analysis indicated that intron 3 contains pupal enhancers conserved during the evolution of the genus, despite the fact that only 30% of the d. melanogaster intron 3 sequences lie in conserved blocks. additional analysis of d. melanogaster transgenic reporter lines harboring intron 3 sequences from d. willistoni revealed the absence of an abdomen-specific expression pattern, probably due to the above-mentioned loss of a regulatory module in this species.

the segmentation gene network of drosophila consists of maternal and zygotic factors that generate, by transcriptional (cross-) regulation, expression patterns of increasing complexity along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. using known binding site information for maternal and zygotic gap transcription factors, the computer algorithm ahab recovers known segmentation control elements (modules) with excellent success and predicts many novel modules within the network and genome-wide. we show that novel module predictions are highly enriched in the network and typically clustered proximal to the promoter, not only upstream, but also in intronic space and downstream. when placed upstream of a reporter gene, they consistently drive patterned blastoderm expression, in most cases faithfully producing one or more pattern elements of the endogenous gene. moreover, we demonstrate for the entire set of known and newly validated modules that ahab's prediction of binding sites correlates well with the expression patterns produced by the modules, revealing basic rules governing their composition. specifically, we show that maternal factors consistently act as activators and that gap factors act as repressors, except for the bimodal factor hunchback. our data suggest a simple context-dependent rule for its switch from repressive to activating function. overall, the composition of modules appears well fitted to the spatiotemporal distribution of their positive and negative input factors. finally, by comparing ahab predictions with different categories of transcription factor input, we confirm the global regulatory structure of the segmentation gene network, but find odd skipped behaving like a primary pair-rule gene. the study expands our knowledge of the segmentation gene network by increasing the number of experimentally tested modules by 50%. for the first time, the entire set of validated modules is analyzed for binding site composition under a uniform set of criteria, permitting the definition of basic composition rules. the study demonstrates that computational methods are a powerful complement to experimental approaches in the analysis of transcription networks.

background: the identification of sequences that control transcription in metazoans is a major goal of genome analysis. in a previous study, we demonstrated that searching for clusters of predicted transcription factor binding sites could discover active regulatory sequences, and identified 37 regions of the drosophila melanogaster genome with high densities of predicted binding sites for five transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior embryonic patterning. nine of these clusters overlapped known enhancers. here, we report the results of in vivo functional analysis of 27 remaining clusters. results: we generated transgenic flies carrying each cluster attached to a basal promoter and reporter gene, and assayed embryos for reporter gene expression. six clusters are enhancers of adjacent genes: giant, fushi tarazu, odd-skipped, nubbin, squeeze and pdm2; three drive expression in patterns unrelated to those of neighboring genes; the remaining 18 do not appear to have enhancer activity. we used the drosophila pseudoobscura genome to compare patterns of evolution in and around the 15 positive and 18 false-positive predictions. although conservation of primary sequence cannot distinguish true from false positives, conservation of binding-site clustering accurately discriminates functional binding-site clusters from those with no function. we incorporated conservation of binding-site clustering into a new genome-wide enhancer screen, and predict several hundred new regulatory sequences, including 85 adjacent to genes with embryonic patterns. conclusions: measuring conservation of sequence features closely linked to function--such as binding-site clusterin--makes better use of comparative sequence data than commonly used methods that examine only sequence identity.

"utilization of tightly linked ovo-a vs. ovo-b germline promoters results in the expression of ovo-a and ovo-b, c(2)h(2) transcription factors with different n -termini, and different effects on target gene transcription and on female germline development. we show that two sex-determination signals, the x chromosome number within the germ cells and a female soma, differentially regulate ovo-b and ovo-a. we have previously shown that ovo regulates ovarian tumor transcription by binding the transcription start site. we have explored the regulation of the ovo-b promoter using an extensive series of transgenic reporter gene constructs to delimit cis-regulatory sequences as assayed in wild-type and sex-transformed flies and flies with altered ovo dose. minimum regulated expression of ovo-b requires a short region flanking the transcription start site, suggesting that the ovo-b core promoter bears regulatory information in addition to a ""basal"" activity. in support of this idea, the core promoter region binds distinct factors in ovary and testis extracts, but not in soma extracts, suggesting that regulatory complexes form at the start site. this idea is further supported by the evolutionarily conserved organization of ovo binding sites at or near the start sites of ovo loci in other flies."

antagonistic activities of glucagon and insulin control metabolism in mammals, and disruption of this balance underlies diabetes pathogenesis. insulin-producing cells (ipcs) in the brain of insects such as drosophila also regulate serum glucose, but it remains unclear whether insulin is the sole hormonal regulator of glucose homeostasis and whether mechanisms of glucose-sensing and response in ipcs resemble those in pancreatic islets. here we show, by targeted cell ablation, that drosophila corpora cardiaca (cc) cells of the ring gland are also essential for larval glucose homeostasis. unlike ipcs, cc cells express drosophila cognates of sulphonylurea receptor (sur) and potassium channel (ir), proteins that comprise atp-sensitive potassium channels regulating hormone secretion by islets and other mammalian glucose-sensing cells. they also produce adipokinetic hormone, a polypeptide with glucagon-like functions. glucose regulation by cc cells is impaired by exposure to sulphonylureas, drugs that target the sur subunit. furthermore, ubiquitous expression of an akh transgene reverses the effect of cc ablation on serum glucose. thus, drosophila cc cells are crucial regulators of glucose homeostasis and they use glucose-sensing and response mechanisms similar to islet cells.

an attack by a parasitic wasp activates a vigorous cellular immune response in drosophila larvae. this response is manifested by an increased number of circulating cells, the hemocytes, and by the appearance of a specialized class of hemocyte, the lamellocytes, which participate in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. to study the molecular mechanisms of this response, we have overexpressed different genes in the hemocytes, by using the gal4-upstream activating sequence system and a hemocyte-specific hemese-gal4 driver. multiple transgenes were tested, representing several important signaling pathways. we found that the proliferation response and the activation of lamellocyte formation are independent phenomena. a drastic increase in the number of circulating hemocytes is caused by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as egfr, pvr, and alk, as well as by the downstream signaling components ras85d and pointed, supporting the notion that the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates hemocyte numbers. in the case of pvr and alk, this phenotype also is accompanied by lamellocyte formation. by contrast, constitutively active hopscotch and hemipterous give massive activation of lamellocyte formation with little or no increase in total hemocyte numbers. this finding indicates that both the jak/stat and the jun kinase pathways affect lamellocyte formation. still other signals, mediated by aop(act), toll(10b), and rac1 expression, cause a simultaneous increase in lamellocyte and total cell numbers, and the same effect is seen when wnt signaling is suppressed. we conclude that the activation of a cellular response is complex and affected by multiple signaling pathways.

the gap genes of drosophila are the first zygotic genes to respond to the maternal positional signals and establish the body pattern along the anterior-posterior axis. the gap gene knirps, required for patterning in the posterior region of the embryo, can be activated throughout the wild-type embryo and is normally repressed from the anterior and posterior sides. these results provide direct molecular evidence that the posterior morphogen system interacts in a fundamentally different manner than do hunchback and bicoid, which are responsible for anterior pattern formation.

in both vertebrates and invertebrates, members of the lim-homeodomain (lim-hd) family of transcription factors act in combinatorial codes to specify motoneuron subclass identities. in the developing drosophila embryo, the lim-hd factors islet (tailup) and lim3, specify the set of motoneuron subclasses that innervate ventral muscle targets. however, as several subclasses express both islet and lim3, this combinatorial code alone cannot explain how these motoneuron groups are further differentiated. to identify additional factors that may act to refine this lim-hd code, we have analyzed the expression of pou genes in the drosophila embryonic nerve cord. we find that the class iii pou protein, drifter (ventral veinless), is co-expressed with islet and lim3 specifically in the isnb motoneuron subclass. loss-of-function and misexpression studies demonstrate that the lim-hd combinatorial code requires drifter to confer target specificity between the isnb and tn motoneuron subclasses. to begin to elucidate molecules downstream of the lim-hd code, we examined the involvement of the beaten path (beat) family of immunoglobulin-containing cell-adhesion molecules. we find that beat ic genetically interacts with islet and lim3 in the tn motoneuron subclass and can also rescue the tn fasciculation defects observed in islet and lim3 mutants. these results suggest that in the tn motoneuron context, islet and lim3 may specify axon target selection through the actions of igsf call-adhesion molecules.

during drosophila embryogenesis, segments, each with an anterior and posterior compartment, are generated by the segmentation genes while the hox genes provide each segment with a unique identity. these two processes have been thought to occur independently. here we show that abdominal hox proteins work directly with two different segmentation proteins, sloppy paired and engrailed, to repress the hox target gene distalless in anterior and posterior compartments, respectively. these results suggest that segmentation proteins can function as hox cofactors and reveal a previously unanticipated use of compartments for gene regulation by hox proteins. our results suggest that these two classes of proteins may collaborate to directly control gene expression at many downstream target genes.

for drosophila, the choice between male and female development is made by the switch gene, sxl, in response to the x:a ratio. once sxl is turned on in females, it actively maintains the determined state, independent of the x:a signal, by a positive autoregulatory feedback loop in which sxl proteins direct the female-specific splicing of sxl transcripts. in this paper we have investigated the mechanism controlling pathway initiation. our results suggest a two-step model for the initial activation of sxl in females. in the first step, a special class of sxl mrnas is expressed in female embryos from an early promoter that responds to the genes signaling the x:a ratio. the proteins produced from these early mrnas then initiate the autoregulatory loop by directing the female-specific processing of transcripts from the late sxl promoter.

mitochondrial biogenesis is a complex and highly regulated process that requires the controlled expression of hundreds of genes encoded in two separated genomes, namely the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. to identify regulatory proteins involved in the transcriptional control of key nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, we have performed a detailed analysis of the promoter region of the alpha subunit of the drosophila melanogaster f1f0 atp synthase complex. using transient transfection assays, we have identified a 56 bp cis-acting proximal regulatory region that contains binding sites for the gaga factor and the alcohol dehydrogenase distal factor 1. in vitro mutagenesis revealed that both sites are functional, and phylogenetic footprinting showed that they are conserved in other drosophila species and in anopheles gambiae. the 56 bp region has regulatory enhancer properties and strongly activates heterologous promoters in an orientation-independent manner. in addition, northern blot and rt-pcr analysis identified two alpha-f1-atpase mrnas that differ in the length of the 3' untranslated region due to the selection of alternative polyadenylation sites.

the drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene is expressed in a specific set of tissues during larval development and in adults. expression in the adult fat body is controlled by the adh adult enhancer (aae). previous studies identified a negative regulatory element in the aae and a protein that binds specifically to this sequence [adult enhancer factor-1 (aef-1)]. here, we show that the aef-1-binding site in the aae and in two other drosophila fat body enhancers overlaps a sequence recognized by the mammalian transcription factor ccaat/enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp). remarkably, these two proteins also bind specifically to overlapping sites in a liver-specific regulatory element of the human adh gene. cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells reveal that c/ebp stimulates the activity of the aae by 50-fold, and this activity can be suppressed by aef-1. in addition, aef-1 prevents c/ebp binding in vitro, and displaces prebound c/ebp. thus, a tissue-specific regulatory unit consisting of one positive and one negative regulatory element has been conserved between drosophila and man.

tetraspanins are evolutionary conserved transmembrane proteins thought to facilitate cell proliferation, movement or fusion by acting as organizers of different signaling events. despite their prevalence and conservation, their specific role and functions remain largely elusive, as their redundancy in various organisms has hindered loss of function studies. here, we take a gain of function approach to study drosophila tetraspanin tsp68c and its effect on larval hemocytes. we recently characterized a lethal mutation in ytr, a conserved gene that encodes a nuclear arginine-rich protein of unknown function, which is accompanied by abnormal differentiation and proliferation of the larval hematopoietic tissue in flies. a hemolectin (hml)-gal4 construct carried by hml-gal4 transgenic flies was sufficient by itself to abrogate the hematopoietic defects in ytr mutant larvae. this rescue correlated with the overexpression of tsp68c, a tetraspanin gene nested in the hml promoter. the suppression of abnormal proliferation by the hml-gal4 construct was not restricted to ytr-deficient hemocytes, but was also observed in hemocytes expressing the oncogenic forms of raf or ras proteins. however, it had no effect on overproliferation mediated by a constitutively active form of jak. new hml-gal4 lines, in which the tsp68c gene was silenced or deleted from the promoter, no longer rescued the hematopoietic defect in ytr mutants nor suppressed the activated raf-induced overproliferation. therefore, change in tetraspanin tsp68c expression has a strong suppressor effect on abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hemocytes in the context of specific lesions, such as overactivation of the ras/raf/mapk pathway.

for a particular functional family of basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors, there is ample evidence that different factors regulate different target genes but little idea of how these different target genes are distinguished. we investigated the contribution of dna binding site differences to the specificities of two functionally related proneural bhlh transcription factors required for the genesis of drosophila sense organ precursors (atonal and scute). we show that the proneural target gene, bearded, is regulated by both scute and atonal via distinct e-box consensus binding sites. by comparing with other ato-dependent enhancer sequences, we define an ato-specific binding consensus that differs from the previously defined scute-specific e-box consensus, thereby defining distinct e(ato) and e(sc) sites. these e-box variants are crucial for function. first, tandem repeats of 20-bp sequences containing e(ato) and e(sc) sites are sufficient to confer atonal- and scute-specific expression patterns, respectively, on a reporter gene in vivo. second, interchanging e(ato) and e(sc) sites within enhancers almost abolishes enhancer activity. while the latter finding shows that enhancer context is also important in defining how proneural proteins interact with these sites, it is clear that differential utilization of dna binding sites underlies proneural protein specificity.

ets transcription factors play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. coordinated regulation of the drosophila ets transcription factors yan and pointed is required for eliciting appropriate responses to receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) signaling. yan, a transcriptional repressor, and pointed, a transcriptional activator, compete for regulatory regions of common target genes, with the ultimate outcome likely influenced by context-specific interactions with binding partners such as mae. previous work in cultured cells has led us to propose that mae attenuates the transcriptional activity of both yan and pointed, although its effects on pointed remain controversial. here we describe a new layer of complexity to this regulatory hierarchy whereby mae expression is itself directly regulated by the opposing action of yan and pointed. in addition, we report that mae can antagonize pointed function during eye development; a finding that suggests mae operates as a dual positive and negative regulator of rtk-mediated signaling in vivo. together our results lead us to propose that a combination of protein-protein and transcriptional interactions between mae, yan and pointed establishes a complex regulatory circuit that ensures that both down-regulation and activation of the rtk pathway occur appropriately according to specific developmental context.

in drosophila, commitment of a cell to a sense organ precursor (sop) fate requires bhlh proneural transcription factor upregulation, a process that depends in most cases on the interplay of proneural gene autoregulation and inhibitory notch signaling. a subset of sops are selected by a recruitment pathway involving egfr signaling to ectodermal cells expressing the proneural gene atonal. we show that egfr signaling drives recruitment by directly facilitating atonal autoregulation. pointed, the transcription factor that mediates egfr signaling, and atonal protein itself bind cooperatively to adjacent conserved binding sites in an atonal enhancer. recruitment is therefore contingent on the combined presence of atonal protein (providing competence) and egfr signaling (triggering recruitment). thus, autoregulation is the nodal control point targeted by signaling. this exemplifies a simple and general mechanism for regulating the transition from competence to cell fate commitment whereby a cell signal directly targets the autoregulation of a selector gene.

"background: cell-specific gene regulation is often controlled by specific combinations of dna binding sites in target enhancers or promoters. a key question is whether these sites are randomly arranged or if there is an organizational pattern or ""architecture"" within such regulatory modules. during notch signaling in drosophila proneural clusters, cell-specific activation of certain notch target genes is known to require transcriptional synergy between the notch intracellular domain (nicd) complexed with csl proteins bound to ""s"" dna sites and proneural bhlh activator proteins bound to nearby ""a"" dna sites. previous studies have implied that arbitrary combinations of s and a dna binding sites (an ""s+a"" transcription code) can mediate the notch-proneural transcriptional synergy. results: by contrast, we show that the notch-proneural transcriptional synergy critically requires a particular dna site architecture (""sps""), which consists of a pair of specifically-oriented s binding sites. native and synthetic promoter analysis shows that the sps architecture in combination with proneural a sites creates a minimal dna regulatory code, ""sps+a"", that is both sufficient and critical for mediating the notch-proneural synergy. transgenic drosophila analysis confirms the sps orientation requirement during notch signaling in proneural clusters. we also present evidence that csl interacts directly with the proneural daughterless protein, thus providing a molecular mechanism for this synergy. conclusions: the sps architecture functions to mediate or enable the notch-proneural transcriptional synergy which drives notch target gene activation in specific cells. thus, sps+a is an architectural dna transcription code that programs a cell-specific pattern of gene expression."

thermotaxis is important for animal survival, but the molecular identities of temperature sensors controlling this behavior have not been determined. we demonstrate dtrpa1, a heat-activated transient receptor potential (trp) family ion channel, is essential for thermotaxis in drosophila. dtrpa1 knockdown eliminates avoidance of elevated temperatures along a thermal gradient. we observe dtrpa1 expression in cells without previously ascribed roles in thermosensation and implicate dtrpa1-expressing neurons in mediating thermotaxis. our data suggest that thermotaxis relies upon neurons and molecules distinct from those required for high-temperature nociception. we propose dtrpa1 may control thermotaxis by sensing environmental temperature.

the gain, loss or modification of morphological traits is generally associated with changes in gene regulation during development. however, the molecular bases underlying these evolutionary changes have remained elusive. here we identify one of the molecular mechanisms that contributes to the evolutionary gain of a male-specific wing pigmentation spot in drosophila biarmipes, a species closely related to drosophila melanogaster. we show that the evolution of this spot involved modifications of an ancestral cis-regulatory element of the yellow pigmentation gene. this element has gained multiple binding sites for transcription factors that are deeply conserved components of the regulatory landscape controlling wing development, including the selector protein engrailed. the evolutionary stability of components of regulatory landscapes, which can be co-opted by chance mutations in cis-regulatory elements, might explain the repeated evolution of similar morphological patterns, such as wing pigmentation patterns in flies.

aa robust inflammatory response to tissue damage and infection is conserved across almost all animal phyla. neutrophils and macrophages, or their equivalents, are drawn to the wound site where they engulf cell and matrix debris and release signals that direct components of the repair process. this orchestrated cell migration is clinically important, and yet, to date, leukocyte chemotaxis has largely been studied in vitro. here, we describe a genetically tractable in vivo wound model of inflammation in the drosophila melanogaster embryo that is amenable to cinemicroscopy. for the first time, we are able to examine the roles of rho-family small gtpases during inflammation in vivo and show that rac-mediated lamellae are essential for hemocyte motility and rho signaling is necessary for cells to retract from sites of matrix- and cell-cell contacts. cdc42 is necessary for maintaining cellular polarity and yet, despite in vitro evidence, is dispensable for sensing and crawling toward wound cues.

condensation is a process whereby a tissue undergoes a coordinated decrease in size and increase in cellular density during development. although it occurs in many developmental contexts, the mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. here, we investigate condensation in the embryonic drosophila ventral nerve cord (vnc). two major events coincide with condensation during embryogenesis: the deposition of extracellular matrix by hemocytes, and the onset of central nervous system activity. we find that preventing hemocyte migration by removing the function of the drosophila vegf receptor homologue, pvr, or by disrupting rac1 function in these cells, inhibits condensation. in the absence of hemocytes migrating adjacent to the developing vnc, the extracellular matrix components collagen iv, viking and peroxidasin are not deposited around this tissue. blocking neural activity by targeted expression of tetanus toxin light chain or an inwardly rectifying potassium channel also inhibits condensation. we find that disrupting rac1 function in either glia or neurons, including those located in the nerve cord, causes a similar phenotype. our data suggest that condensation of the vnc during drosophila embryogenesis depends on both hemocyte-deposited extracellular matrix and neural activity, and allow us to propose a mechanism whereby these processes work together to shape the developing central nervous system.

"neurogenesis depends on a family of proneural transcriptional activator proteins, but the ""proneural"" function of these factors is poorly understood, in part because the ensemble of genes they activate, directly or indirectly, has not been identified systematically. we have taken a direct approach to this problem in drosophila. fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to recover a purified population of the cells that comprise the ""proneural clusters"" from which sensory organ precursors of the peripheral nervous system (pns) arise. whole-genome microarray analysis and in situ hybridization was then used to identify and verify a set of genes that are preferentially expressed in proneural cluster cells. genes in this set encode proteins with a diverse array of implied functions, and loss-of-function analysis of two candidate genes shows that they are indeed required for normal pns development. bioinformatic and reporter gene studies further illuminate the cis-regulatory codes that direct expression in proneural clusters."

tissue induction during embryonic development relies to a significant degree on the integration of combinatorial regulatory inputs at the enhancer level of target genes. during mesodermal tissue induction in drosophila, various combinations of inductive signals and mesoderm-intrinsic transcription factors cooperate to induce the progenitors of different types of muscle and heart precursors at precisely defined positions within the mesoderm layer. dpp signals are required in cooperation with the mesoderm-specific nk homeodomain transcription factor tinman (tin) to induce all dorsal mesodermal tissue derivatives, which include dorsal somatic muscles, the dorsal vessel and visceral muscles of the midgut. wingless (wg) signals modulate the responses to dpp/tin along anteroposterior positions by cooperating with dpp/tin during dorsal vessel and somatic muscle induction while antagonizing dpp/tin during visceral mesoderm induction. as a result, dorsal muscle and cardiac progenitors form in a pattern that is reciprocal to that of visceral muscle precursors along the anteroposterior axis. our present study addresses how positive dpp signals and antagonistic wg inputs are integrated at the enhancer level of bagpipe (bap), a nk homeobox gene that serves as an early regulator of visceral mesoderm development. we show that an evolutionarily conserved bap enhancer element requires combinatorial binding sites for tin and dpp-activated smad proteins for its activity. adjacent binding sites for the foxg transcription factors encoded by the sloppy paired genes (slp1 and slp2), which are direct targets of the wg signaling cascade, serve to block the synergistic activity of tin and activated smads during bap induction. in addition, we show that binding sites for yet unknown repressors are essential to prevent the induction of the bap enhancer by dpp in the dorsal ectoderm. our data illustrate how the same signal combinations can have opposite effects on different targets in the same cells during tissue induction.

the regulation of development by hox proteins is important in the evolution of animal morphology, but how the regulatory sequences of hox-regulated target genes function and evolve is unclear. to understand the regulatory organization and evolution of a hox target gene, we have identified a wing-specific cis-regulatory element controlling the knot gene, which is expressed in the developing drosophila wing but not the haltere. this regulatory element contains a single binding site that is crucial for activation by the transcription factor cubitus interruptus (ci), and a cluster of binding sites for repression by the hox protein ultrabithorax (ubx). the negative and positive control regions are physically separable, demonstrating that ubx does not repress by competing for occupancy of ci-binding sites. although knot expression is conserved among drosophila species, this cluster of ubx binding sites is not. we isolated the knot wing cis-regulatory element from d. pseudoobscura, which contains a cluster of ubx-binding sites that is not homologous to the functionally defined d. melanogaster cluster. it is, however, homologous to a second d. melanogaster region containing a cluster of ubx sites that can also function as a repressor element. thus, the knot regulatory region in d. melanogaster has two apparently functionally redundant blocks of sequences for repression by ubx, both of which are widely separated from activator sequences. this redundancy suggests that the complete evolutionary unit of regulatory control is larger than the minimal experimentally defined control element. the span of regulatory sequences upon which selection acts may, in general, be more expansive and less modular than functional studies of these elements have previously indicated.

hox genes encode evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators, which define regional identities along the anteroposterior axis of multicellular animals. in drosophila, hox proteins bind to target dna sequences in association with the extradenticle (exd) and homothorax (hth) co-factors. the current model of hox-binding selectivity proposes that the nucleotide sequence identity defines the hox protein engaged in the trimeric complex, implying that distinct hox/exd/hth complexes select different binding sites and that a given hox/exd/hth complex recognizes a consensus dna sequence. here, we report that the regulation of a newly identified lab target gene does not rely on the previously established consensus lab/exd/hth-binding site, but on a strongly divergent sequence. thus lab, and most probably other hox proteins, selects different dna sequences in regulating downstream target genes. these observations have implications with regard to the current model of hox-binding selectivity.

pimt, a transcriptional coactivator which interacts with and enhances nuclear receptor coactivator prip function, was identified recently in mammalian cells and suggested to function as a link between two major multiprotein complexes anchored by cbp/p300 and pbp. here we describe that the gene of the drosophila homologue of pimt, designated as dtl, is closely associated and has an overlapping promoter with a gene encoding another transcriptional coactivator, ada2a, which in turn participates in gcn5 hat-containing complexes. ada2a also produces an rna polii subunit, rpb4, via alternative splicing; consequently, an overlapping regulatory region serves for the production of three proteins, each involved in transcription. by studying expression of reporter gene fusions in tissue culture cells and transgenic animals we have demonstrated that the regulatory regions of ada2a/rpb4 and dtl overlap and the dtl promoter is partly within the ada2a/rpb4 coding region. the shared regulatory region contains a dre element, binding site of dref, the protein factor involved in the regulation of a number of genes which play a role in dna replication and cell proliferation. despite the perfectly symmetrical dre, dref seems to have a more decisive role in ada2a/rpb4 transcription than in the transcription of dtl.

"the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd) is distributed in an embryonic gradient that is critical for patterning the anterior-posterior (ap) body plan in drosophila. previous work identified several target genes that respond directly to bcd-dependent activation. positioning of these targets along the ap axis is thought to be controlled by cis-regulatory modules (crms) that contain clusters of bcd-binding sites of different ""strengths."" here we use a combination of bcd-site cluster analysis and evolutionary conservation to predict bcd-dependent crms. we tested 14 predicted crms by in vivo reporter gene assays; 11 show bcd-dependent activation, which brings the total number of known bcd target elements to 21. some crms drive expression patterns that are restricted to the most anterior part of the embryo, whereas others extend into middle and posterior regions. however, we do not detect a strong correlation between ap position of target gene expression and the strength of bcd site clusters alone. rather, we find that binding sites for other activators, including hunchback and caudal correlate with crm expression in middle and posterior body regions. also, many bcd-dependent crms contain clusters of sites for the gap protein kruppel, which may limit the posterior extent of activation by the bcd gradient. we propose that the key design principle in ap patterning is the differential integration of positive and negative transcriptional information at the level of individual crms for each target gene."

"dorsal is a sequence-specific transcription factor that is distributed in a broad nuclear gradient across the dorsal-ventral (dv) axis of the early drosophila embryo. it initiates gastrulation by regulating at least 30-50 target genes in a concentration-dependent fashion. previous studies identified 18 enhancers that are directly regulated by different concentrations of dorsal. here, we employ computational methods to determine the basis for these distinct transcriptional outputs. orthologous enhancers were identified in a variety of divergent drosophila species, and their comparison revealed several conserved sequence features responsible for dv patterning. in particular, the quality of dorsal and twist recognition sequences correlates with the dv coordinates of gene expression relative to the dorsal gradient. these findings are entirely consistent with a gradient threshold model for dv patterning, whereby the quality of individual dorsal binding sites determines in vivo occupancy of target enhancers by the dorsal gradient. linked dorsal and twist binding sites constitute a conserved composite element in certain ""type 2"" dorsal target enhancers, which direct gene expression in ventral regions of the neurogenic ectoderm in response to intermediate levels of the dorsal gradient. similar motif arrangements were identified in orthologous loci in the distant mosquito genome, anopheles gambiae. we discuss how dorsal and twist work either additively or synergistically to activate different target enhancers."

the distinct muscles of an organism accumulate different quantities of structural proteins, but always maintaining their stoichiometry. however, the mechanisms that control the levels of these proteins and that co-ordinate muscle gene expression remain to be defined. the paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene encodes two thick filament proteins transcribed from two different promoters. we have analysed the regulatory regions that control expression of this gene and that are situated in the two promoters, the 5' and the internal promoters, both in vivo and in silico. a distal muscle enhancer containing three conserved mef2 motifs is essential to drive high levels of paramyosin expression in all the major embryonic, larval and adult muscles. this enhancer shares sequence motifs, as well as its structure and organisation, with at least four co-regulated muscle enhancers that direct similar patterns of expression. however, other elements located downstream of the enhancer are also required for correct gene expression. other muscle genes with different patterns of expression, such as miniparamyosin, are regulated by other basic mechanisms. the expression of miniparamyosin is controlled by two enhancers, ab and tx, but a bf modulator is required to ensure the correct levels of expression in each particular muscle. we propose a mechanism of transcriptional regulation in which similar enhancers are responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of co-regulated genes. however, it is the interaction between enhancers which ensures that the correct amounts of protein are expressed at any particular time in a cell, adapting these levels to their specific needs. these mechanisms may not be exclusive to neural or muscle tissue and might represent a general mechanism for genes that are spatially and temporally co-regulated.

we used wounded drosophila embryos to define an evolutionarily conserved pathway for repairing the epidermal surface barrier. this pathway includes a wound response enhancer from the ddc gene that requires grainy head (grh) function and binding sites for the grh transcription factor. at the signaling level, tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) activities are induced in epidermal cells near wounds, and activated erk is required for a robust wound response. the conservation of this grh-dependent pathway suggests that the repair of insect cuticle and mammal skin is controlled by an ancient, shared control system for constructing and healing the animal body surface barrier.

early heart development in drosophila and vertebrates involves the specification of cardiac precursor cells within paired progenitor fields, followed by their movement into a linear heart tube structure. the latter process requires coordinated cell interactions, migration, and differentiation as the primitive heart develops toward status as a functional organ. in the drosophila embryo, cardioblasts emerge from bilateral dorsal mesoderm primordia, followed by alignment as rows of cells that meet at the midline and morph into a dorsal vessel. genes that function in coordinating cardioblast organization, migration, and assembly are integral to heart development, and their encoded proteins need to be understood as to their roles in this vital morphogenetic process. here we prove the toll transmembrane protein is expressed in a secondary phase of heart formation, at lateral cardioblast surfaces as they align, migrate to the midline, and form the linear tube. the toll dorsal vessel enhancer has been characterized, with its activity controlled by dorsocross and tinman transcription factors. consistent with the observed protein expression pattern, phenotype analyses demonstrate toll function is essential for normal dorsal vessel formation. such findings implicate toll as a critical cell adhesion molecule in the alignment and migration of cardioblasts during dorsal vessel morphogenesis.

we show that reducing the activity of the drosophila runx protein lozenge (lz) during pupal development causes a decrease in cell death in the eye. we identified lz-binding sites in introns of argos (aos) and klumpfuss (klu) and demonstrate that these genes are directly activated targets of lz. loss of either aos or klu reduces cell death, suggesting that lz promotes apoptosis at least in part by regulating aos and klu. these results provide novel insights into the control of programmed cell death (pcd) by lz during drosophila eye development.

the dorsal gradient produces sequential patterns of gene expression across the dorsoventral axis of early embryos, thereby establishing the presumptive mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and dorsal ectoderm. spatially localized repressors such as snail and vnd exclude the expression of neurogenic genes in the mesoderm and ventral neuroectoderm, respectively. however, no repressors have been identified that establish the dorsal limits of neurogenic gene expression. to investigate this issue, we have conducted an analysis of the ind gene, which is selectively expressed in lateral regions of the presumptive nerve cord. a novel silencer element was identified within the ind enhancer that is essential for eliminating expression in the dorsal ectoderm. evidence is presented that the associated repressor can function over long distances to silence neighboring enhancers. the ind enhancer also contains a variety of known activator and repressor elements. we propose a model whereby dorsal and egf signaling, together with the localized schnurri repressor, define a broad domain of ind expression throughout the entire presumptive neuroectoderm. the ventral limits of gene expression are defined by the snail and vnd repressors, while the dorsal border is established by the newly defined silencer element.

understanding how organs acquire the capacity to perform their respective functions is important for both cell and developmental biology. here, we have examined the role of early-expressed transcription factors in activating genes crucial for secretory function in the drosophila salivary gland. we show that expression of genes encoding proteins required for er targeting and translocation, and proteins that mediate transport between the er and golgi is very high in the early salivary gland. this high level expression requires two early salivary gland transcription factors; creba is required throughout embryogenesis and fkh is required only during late embryonic stages. as fkh is required to maintain late creba expression in the salivary gland, fkh probably works through creba to affect secretory pathway gene expression. in support of these regulatory interactions, we show that creba is important for elevated secretion in the salivary gland. additionally, creba is required for the expression of the secretory pathway genes in the embryonic epidermis, where creba had previously been shown to be essential for cuticle development. we show that zygotic mutations in several individual secretory pathway genes result in larval cuticle phenotypes nearly identical to those of creba mutants. thus, creba activity is linked to secretory function in multiple tissues.

in drosophila, the sine oculis (so) gene is important for the development of the entire visual system, including bolwig's organ, compound eyes and ocelli. together with twin of eyeless, eyeless, eyes absent and dachshund, so belongs to a network of genes that by complex interactions initiate eye development. although much is known about the genetic interactions of the genes belonging to this retinal determination network, only a few such regulatory interactions have been analysed down to the level of dna-protein interactions. previous work in our laboratory identified an eye/ocellus specific enhancer of the sine oculis gene that is directly regulated by eyeless and twin of eyeless. we further characterized this regulatory element and identified a minimal enhancer fragment of so that sets up an autoregulatory feedback loop crucial for proper ocelli development. by systematic analysis of the dna-binding specificity of so we identified the most important nucleotides for this interaction. using the emerging consensus sequence for so-dna binding we performed a genome-wide search and have thereby been able to identify eyeless as well as the signalling gene hedgehog as putative targets of so. our results strengthen the general assumption that feedback loops among the genes of the retinal determination network are crucial for proper development of eyes and ocelli.

drosophila eye development is controlled by a conserved network of retinal determination (rd) genes. the rd genes encode nuclear proteins that form complexes and function in concert with extracellular signal-regulated transcription factors. identification of the genomic regulatory elements that govern the eye-specific expression of the rd genes will allow us to better understand how spatial and temporal control of gene expression occurs during early eye development. we compared conserved non-coding sequences (cncss) between five drosophilids along the approximately 40 kb genomic locus of the rd gene dachshund (dac). our analysis uncovers two separate eye enhancers in intron eight and the 3' non-coding regions of the dac locus defined by clusters of highly conserved sequences. loss- and gain-of-function analyses suggest that the 3' eye enhancer is synergistically activated by a combination of eya, so and dpp signaling, and only indirectly activated by ey, whereas the 5' eye enhancer is primarily regulated by ey, acting in concert with eya and so. disrupting conserved so-binding sites in the 3' eye enhancer prevents reporter expression in vivo. our results suggest that the two eye enhancers act redundantly and in concert with each other to integrate distinct upstream inputs and direct the eye-specific expression of dac.

reversed polarity (repo) is a putative target gene of glial cells missing (gcm), the primary regulator of glial cell fate in drosophila. transient expression of gcm is followed by maintained expression of repo. multiple gcm binding sites are found in repo upstream dna. however, while repo is expressed in gcm positive glia, it is not expressed in gcm positive hemocytes. these observations suggest factors in addition to gcm are required for repo expression. here we have undertaken an analysis of the cis-regulatory dna elements of repo using lacz reporter activity in transgenic embryos. we have found that a 4.2 kb dna region upstream of the repo start site drives the wild-type repo expression pattern. we show that expression is dependent on multiple gcm binding sites. by ectopically expressing repo, we show that repo can regulate its own enhancer. finally, by systematically analyzing fragments of repo upstream dna, we show that expression is dependent on multiple elements that are responsible for activity in subsets of glia, as well as repressing inappropriate expression in the epidermis. our results suggest that gcm acts synergistically with other factors to control repo transcription in glial cells.

lateral inhibition, wherein a single cell signals to its neighbors to prevent them from adopting its own fate, is the best-known setting for cell-cell communication via the notch (n) pathway. during peripheral neurogenesis in drosophila, sensory organ precursor (sop) cells arise within proneural clusters (pncs), small groups of cells endowed with sop fate potential by their expression of proneural transcriptional activators. sops use n signaling to activate in neighboring pnc cells the expression of multiple genes that inhibit the sop fate. these genes respond transcriptionally to direct regulation by both the proneural proteins and the n pathway transcription factor suppressor of hairless [su(h)], and their activation is generally highly asymmetric; i.e. only in the inhibited (non-sop) cells of the pnc, and not in sops. we show that the substantially higher proneural protein levels in the sop put this cell at risk of inappropriately activating the sop-inhibitory genes, even without input from n-activated su(h). we demonstrate that this is prevented by direct ;default' repression of these genes by su(h), acting through the same binding sites it uses for activation in non-sops. we show that de-repression of even a single n pathway target gene in the sop can extinguish the sop cell fate. finally, we define crucial roles for the adaptor protein hairless and the co-repressors groucho and ctbp in conferring repressive activity on su(h) in the sop. our work elucidates the regulatory logic by which n signaling and the proneural proteins cooperate to create the neural precursor/epidermal cell fate distinction during lateral inhibition.

the existence of hemangioblasts, which serve as common progenitors for hematopoietic cells and cardioblasts, has suggested a molecular link between cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis in drosophila. however, the molecular mediators that might link hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis remain unknown. here, we show that the highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factor hand is expressed in cardioblasts, pericardial nephrocytes and hematopoietic progenitors. the homeodomain protein tinman and the gata factors pannier and serpent directly activate hand in these cell types through a minimal enhancer, which is necessary and sufficient to drive hand expression in these different cell types. hand is activated by tinman and pannier in cardioblasts and pericardial nephrocytes, and by serpent in hematopoietic progenitors in the lymph gland. these findings place hand at a nexus of the transcriptional networks that govern cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis, and indicate that the transcriptional pathways involved in development of the cardiovascular, excretory and hematopoietic systems may be more closely related than previously appreciated.

chromatin condensation is a typical feature of sperm cells. during mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then by protamines, while little is known for drosophila melanogaster. here we characterize three genes in the fly genome, mst35ba, mst35bb, and mst77f. the results indicate that mst35ba and mst35bb encode dprota and dprotb, respectively. these are considerably larger than mammalian protamines, but, as in mammals, both protamines contain typical cysteine/arginine clusters. mst77f encodes a linker histone-like protein showing significant similarity to mammalian hils1 protein. protaminea-enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp), protamineb-egfp, and mst77f-egfp carrying drosophila lines show that these proteins become the important chromosomal protein components of elongating spermatids, and his2avdgfp vanishes. mst77f mutants [ms(3)nc3] are characterized by small round nuclei and are sterile as males. these data suggest the major features of chromatin condensation in drosophila spermatogenesis correspond to those in mammals. during early fertilization steps, the paternal pronucleus still contains protamines and mst77f but regains a nucleosomal conformation before zygote formation. in eggs laid by sesame-deficient females, the paternal pronucleus remains in a protamine-based chromatin status but mst77f-egfp is removed, suggesting that the sesame gene product is essential for removal of protamines while mst77f removal is independent of sesame.

wnt signaling controls important aspects of animal development, and its deregulation has been causally linked to cancer. transduction of wnt signals entails the association of beta-catenin with nuclear tcf dna binding proteins and the subsequent activation of target genes. the transcriptional activity of armadillo (arm, the drosophila beta-catenin homolog) largely depends on two recently discovered components, legless (lgs) and pygopus (pygo). lgs functions as an adaptor between arm/beta-catenin and pygo, but different mechanisms have been proposed as to how arm/beta-catenin is controlled by lgs and pygo. although lgs and pygo were originally thought to serve as nuclear cofactors for arm/beta-catenin to enhance its transactivation capacity, a recent analysis argued that they function instead to target arm/beta-catenin to the nucleus. here, we used genetic assays in cultured cells and in vivo to discriminate between the two paradigms. regardless of the measures taken to maintain the nuclear presence of arm/beta-catenin, a transcriptional-activation function of pygo could not be bypassed. our findings therefore indicate that arm/beta-catenin depends on lgs and pygo primarily for its transcriptional output rather than for its nuclear import.

during insect metamorphosis, a pulse of ecdysteroids induces many different morphological changes depending on different parts of the body. in drosophila, although a number of transcription factors are expressed in a stage-specific manner in response to an ecdysteroid pulse, little is known on the regulatory mechanism for space-specific gene expression during metamorphosis. the edg84a gene encoding pupal cuticle protein is one of the targets of ecdysteroid-inducible transcription factor betaftz-f1 and is expressed only in anterior epidermis of the body during mid- to late prepupal period, whereas betaftz-f1 is expressed in almost all tissues. to address the regulatory mechanism of the tissue-specific expression of the edg84a gene, we established transgenic fly lines which carry various upstream regions of the gene fused to the lacz gene and examined the expression pattern of the reporter gene. results of the transgenic fly reporter assays showed that the space-specific expression is controlled by at least four positive and two negative elements within a 263-bp region near the transcription start site, and at least three of them showed space-specific effects to the anterior body trunk. these results suggest that both high expression level and differential expression are achieved through many cis-regulatory elements.

the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein sumo to lysine side chains plays widespread roles in the regulation of nuclear protein function. since little information is available about the roles of sumo in development, we have screened a collection of chromosomal deficiencies to identify developmental processes regulated by sumo. we found that flies heterozygous for a deficiency uncovering vestigial (vg) and mutations in any of several genes encoding components of the sumo conjugation machinery exhibit severe wing notching. this phenotype is due to an interaction between sumo and vg since it is suppressed by expression of vg from a transgene, and is also observed in flies doubly heterozygous for vg hypomorphic alleles and sumo. in addition, the ability of vg to direct the formation of ectopic wings when misexpressed in the eye field is enhanced by simultaneous misexpression of sumo. in s2 cell transient transfection assays, overexpression of sumo and the sumo conjugating enzyme ubc9, but not a catalytically inactive form of ubc9, results in sumoylation of vg and augments the activation of a vg-responsive reporter. these findings are consistent with the idea that sumoylation stimulates vg function during wing morphogenesis.

the cytokine-activated janus kinase (jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) pathway plays an important role in the control of a wide variety of biological processes. when misregulated, jak/stat signaling is associated with various human diseases, such as immune disorders and tumorigenesis. to gain insights into the mechanisms by which jak/stat signaling participates in these diverse biological responses, we carried out a genome-wide rna interference (rnai) screen in cultured drosophila cells. we identified 121 genes whose double-stranded rna (dsrna)-mediated knockdowns affected stat92e activity. of the 29 positive regulators, 13 are required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of stat92e. furthermore, we found that the drosophila homologs of ranbp3 and ranbp10 are negative regulators of jak/stat signaling through their control of nucleocytoplasmic transport of stat92e. in addition, we identified a key negative regulator of drosophila jak/stat signaling, protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp61f, and showed that it is a transcriptional target of jak/stat signaling, thus revealing a novel negative feedback loop. our study has uncovered many uncharacterized genes required for different steps of the jak/stat signaling pathway.

signalling pathways mediating the transduction of information between cells are essential for development, cellular differentiation and homeostasis. their dysregulation is also frequently associated with human malignancies. the janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (jak/stat) pathway represents one such signalling cascade whose evolutionarily conserved roles include cell proliferation and haematopoiesis. here we describe a systematic genome-wide survey for genes required for jak/stat pathway activity. analysis of 20,026 rna interference (rnai)-induced phenotypes in cultured drosophila melanogaster haemocyte-like cells identified interacting genes encoding 4 known and 86 previously uncharacterized proteins. subsequently, cell-based epistasis experiments were used to classify these proteins on the basis of their interaction with known components of the signalling cascade. in addition to multiple human disease gene homologues, we have found the tyrosine phosphatase ptp61f and the drosophila homologue of brwd3, a bromo-domain-containing protein disrupted in leukaemia. moreover, in vivo analysis demonstrates that disrupted dbrwd3 and overexpressed ptp61f function as suppressors of leukaemia-like blood cell tumours. this screen represents a comprehensive identification of novel loci required for jak/stat signalling and provides molecular insights into an important pathway relevant for human cancer. human homologues of identified pathway modifiers may constitute targets for therapeutic interventions.

we have studied the spatio-temporal pattern of expression of the gene encoding the h(+) adenosine triphosphate (atp) synthase beta subunit (beta-f1-atpase) during drosophila melanogaster development. the beta-f1-atpase mrna is stored in the egg; as development proceeds it is distributed in most embryonic cellular territories, including the mesoderm, and in late embryos it is highly abundant in the ventral cord and midgut. using a combination of transfection assays in schneider cells and p-element transformation in flies, we have identified a proximal 5' upstream region of 258 bp essential for the transcriptional activity of the gene during d. melanogaster embryogenesis that is virtually inactive in adult tissues. electrophoretic mobility shift assays using specific dna fragments from the 258-bp region detect in embryonic nuclear extracts a complex set of dna binding proteins that are largely absent in adults. the transcription factor cf2-ii has been identified as a potential candidate in the regulation of the beta-f1-atpase gene.

feeding is a fundamental activity of all animals that can be regulated by internal energy status or external sensory signals. we have characterized a zinc finger transcription factor, klumpfuss (klu), which is required for food intake in drosophila larvae. microarray analysis indicates that expression of the neuropeptide gene hugin (hug) in the brain is altered in klu mutants and that hug itself is regulated by food signals. neuroanatomical analysis demonstrates that hug-expressing neurons project axons to the pharyngeal muscles, to the central neuroendocrine organ, and to the higher brain centers, whereas hug dendrites are innervated by external gustatory receptor-expressing neurons, as well as by internal pharyngeal chemosensory organs. the use of tetanus toxin to block synaptic transmission of hug neurons results in alteration of food intake initiation, which is dependent on previous nutrient condition. our results provide evidence that hug neurons function within a neural circuit that modulates taste-mediated feeding behavior.

"background: olfactory receptor neurons (orns) convey chemical information into the brain, producing internal representations of odors detected in the periphery. a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms of odor detection and processing requires complete maps of odorant receptor (or) expression and orn connectivity, preferably at single-cell resolution. results: we have constructed near-complete maps of or expression and orn targeting in the drosophila olfactory system. these maps confirm the general validity of the ""one neuron--one receptor"" and ""one glomerulus--one receptor"" principles and reveal several additional features of olfactory organization. orns in distinct sensilla types project to distinct regions of the antennal lobe, but neighbor relations are not preserved. orns grouped in the same sensilla do not express similar receptors, but similar receptors tend to map to closely appositioned glomeruli in the antennal lobe. this organization may serve to ensure that odor representations are dispersed in the periphery but clustered centrally. integrated with electrophysiological data, these maps also predict glomerular representations of specific odorants. representations of aliphatic and aromatic compounds are spatially segregated, with those of aliphatic compounds arranged topographically according to carbon chain length. conclusions: these or expression and orn connectivity maps provide further insight into the molecular, anatomical, and functional organization of the drosophila olfactory system. our maps also provide an essential resource for investigating how internal odor representations are generated and how they are further processed and transmitted to higher brain centers."

olfactory systems confer the recognition and discrimination of a large number of structurally distinct odor molecules. recent molecular analysis of odorant receptor (or) genes and circuits has led to a model of odor coding in which a population of olfactory sensory neurons (osns) expressing a single or converges upon a unique olfactory glomerulus. activation of the or can thus be read out by the activation of its cognate glomerulus. drosophila is a powerful system in which to test this model because the entire repertoire of 62 ors can be manipulated genetically. however, a complete understanding of how fly olfactory circuits are organized is lacking. here, we present a nearly complete map of or projections from osns to the antennal lobe (al) in the fly brain. four populations of osns coexpress two ors along with or83b, and a fifth expresses one or and one gustatory receptor (gr) along with or83b. one glomerulus receives coconvergent input from two separate populations of osns. three ors label sexually dimorphic glomeruli implicated in sexual courtship and are thus candidate drosophila pheromone receptors. this olfactory sensory map provides an experimental framework for relating ors to glomeruli and ultimately behavior.

color vision in drosophila relies on the comparison between two color-sensitive photoreceptors, r7 and r8. two types of ommatidia in which r7 and r8 contain different rhodopsins are distributed stochastically in the retina and appear to discriminate short (p-subset) or long wavelengths (y-subset). the choice between p and y fates is made in r7, which then instructs r8 to follow the corresponding fate, thus leading to a tight coupling between rhodopsins expressed in r7 and r8. here, we show that warts, encoding large tumor suppressor (lats) and melted encoding a ph-domain protein, play opposite roles in defining the yr 8 or pr8 fates. by interacting antagonistically at the transcriptional level, they form a bistable loop that insures a robust commitment of r8 to a single fate, without allowing ambiguity. this represents an unexpected postmitotic role for genes controlling cell proliferation (warts and its partner hippo and salvador) and cell growth (melted).

hunger elicits diverse, yet coordinated, adaptive responses across species, but the underlying signaling mechanism remains poorly understood. here, we report on the function and mechanism of the drosophila insulin-like system in the central regulation of different hunger-driven behaviors. we found that overexpression of drosophila insulin-like peptides (dilps) in the nervous system of fasted larvae suppressed the hunger-driven increase of ingestion rate and intake of nonpreferred foods (e.g., a less accessible solid food). moreover, up-regulation of drosophila p70/s6 kinase activity in dilp neurons led to attenuated hunger response by fasted larvae, whereas its down-regulation triggered fed larvae to display motivated foraging and feeding. finally, we provide evidence that neural regulation of food preference but not ingestion rate may involve direct signaling by dilps to neurons expressing neuropeptide f receptor 1, a receptor for neuropeptide y-like neuropeptide f. our study reveals a prominent role of neural drosophila p70/s6 kinase in the modulation of hunger response by insulin-like and neuropeptide y-like signaling pathways.

"suppressor of hairless (su(h)) is required at two stages of adult sensory organ development in drosophila. complete loss of su(h) function results in a ""neurogenic"" phenotype in imaginal discs, in which too many cells adopt the sensory organ precursor cell fate. su(h) is also involved in controlling the fates of sensillum accessory cells and is specifically expressed in two of these cells. su(h) is the drosophila homolog of the mouse j kappa rbp gene, whose product binds specifically to the recombination signal sequence of immunoglobulin j kappa segments. the su(h) and j kappa rbp proteins are 82% identical over most of their length, and share with bacteriophage integrates and yeast recombinases a motif that includes residues directly involved in catalyzing recombination."

drosophila development depends on stable boundaries between cellular territories, such as the embryonic parasegment boundaries and the compartment boundaries in the imaginal discs. patterning in the compound eye is fundamentally different: the boundary is not stable, but moves (the morphogenetic furrow). paradoxically, hedgehog signaling is essential to both: hedgehog is expressed in the posterior compartments in the embryo and in imaginal discs, and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye. therefore, uniquely in the eye, cells receiving a hedgehog signal will eventually produce the same protein. we report that the mechanism that underlies this difference is the special regulation of hedgehog (hh) transcription through the dual regulation of an eye specific enhancer. we show that this enhancer requires the egfr/ras pathway transcription factor pointed. recently, others have shown that this same enhancer also requires the eye determining transcription factor sine oculis (so). we discuss these data in terms of a model for a combinatorial code of furrow movement.

micrornas (mirnas) regulate posttranscriptional gene activity by binding to specific sequences in the 3' utrs of target mrnas. a number of metazoan mirnas have been shown to exhibit tissue-specific patterns of expression. here, we investigate the possibility that localized expression is mediated by tissue-specific enhancers, comparable to those seen for protein-coding genes. two mirna loci in drosophila melanogaster are investigated, the mir-309-6 polycistron (8-mir) and the mir-1 gene. the 8-mir locus contains a cluster of eight distinct mirnas that are transcribed in a common precursor rna. the 8-mir primary transcript displays a dynamic pattern of expression in early embryos, including repression at the anterior and posterior poles. an 800-bp 5' enhancer was identified that recapitulates this complex pattern when attached to a rna polymerase ii core promoter fused to a lacz-reporter gene. the mir-1 locus is specifically expressed in the mesoderm of gastrulating embryos. bioinformatics methods were used to identify a mesoderm-specific enhancer located approximately 5 kb 5' of the mir-1 transcription unit. evidence is presented that the 8-mir enhancer is regulated by the localized huckebein repressor, whereas mir-1 is activated by dorsal and twist. these results provide evidence that restricted activities of the 8-mir and mir-1 mirnas are mediated by classical tissue-specific enhancers.

the precise regulation of wingless (wg) expression in the drosophila eye disc is key to control the anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning of this disc. here, we identify an eye disc-specific wg cis-regulatory element that functions as a regulatory rheostat. pannier (pnr), a transcription factor previously proposed to act as an upstream activator of wg, is sufficient to activate the eye disc enhancer but required for wg expression only in the peripodial epithelium of the disc. we propose that this regulation of wg by pnr appeared associated to the development of the peripodial epithelium in higher dipterans and was added to an existing mechanism regulating the deployment of wingless in the dorsal region of the eye primordium. in addition, our analysis identifies a separate ventral disc enhancer that lies adjacent to the eye-specific one, and thus altogether, they define a 1-kb genomic region where disc-specific enhancers of the wg gene are located.

the characterisation of ligands that activate the jak/stat pathway has the potential to throw light onto a comparatively poorly understood aspect of this important signal transduction cascade. here, we describe our analysis of the only invertebrate jak/stat pathway ligands identified to date, the drosophila unpaired-like family. we show that upd2 is expressed in a pattern essentially identical to that of upd and demonstrate that the proteins encoded by this region activate jak/stat pathway signalling. mutational analysis demonstrates a mutual semi-redundancy that can be visualised in multiple tissues known to require jak/stat signalling. in order to better characterise the in vivo function of these ligands, we developed a reporter based on a natural jak/stat pathway responsive enhancer and show that ectopic upd2 expression can effectively activate the jak/stat pathway. while both upd and upd2 are secreted jak/stat pathway agonists, tissue culture assays show that the signal-sequences of upd and upd2 confer distinct properties, with upd associated primarily with the extracellular matrix and upd2 secreted into the media. the differing biophysical characteristics identified for upd-like molecules have implications for their function in vivo and adds another aspect to our understanding of cytokine signalling in drosophila.

the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) activates a relatively small number of immediate-early genes during drosophila pupal development, yet is able to orchestrate distinct differentiation events in a wide variety of tissues. here, we demonstrate that expression of the muscle differentiation gene myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) is normally delayed in twist-expressing adult myoblasts until the end of the third larval instar. the late up-regulation of mef2 transcription in larval myoblasts is an ecdysone-dependent event which acts upon an identified mef2 enhancer, and we identify enhancer sequences required for up-regulation. we also present evidence that the ecdysone-induced broad complex of zinc finger transcription factor genes is required for full activation of the myogenic program in these cells. since forced early expression of mef2 in adult myoblasts leads to premature muscle differentiation, our results explain how and why the adult muscle differentiation program is attenuated prior to pupal development. we propose a mechanism for the initiation of adult myogenesis, whereby twist expression in myoblasts provides a cellular context upon which an extrinsic signal builds to control muscle-specific differentiation events, and we discuss the general relevance of this model for gene regulation in animals.

mapping the regulatory modules to which transcription factors bind in vivo is a key step toward understanding of global gene expression programs. we have developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip)-chip strategy for identifying factor-specific regulatory regions acting in vivo. this method, called the chip-enriched in silico targets (chest) approach, combines immunoprecipitation of cross-linked protein-dna complexes (x-chip) with in silico prediction of targets and generation of computed dna microarrays. we report the use of chest in drosophila to identify several previously unknown targets of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2), a key regulator of myogenic differentiation. our approach was validated by demonstrating that the identified sequences act as enhancers in vivo and are able to drive reporter gene expression specifically in mef2-positive muscle cells. presented here, the chest strategy was originally designed to identify regulatory modules in drosophila, but it can be adapted for any sequenced and annotated genome.

dna replication-related element (dre) and the dre-binding factor (dref) play an important role in regulating dna replication-related genes such as pcna and dna polymerase alpha in drosophila. we have previously reported that overexpression of dref in developing eye imaginal discs induced ectopic dna synthesis and apoptosis, which results in rough eyes. to identify genetic interactants with the dref gene, we have carried out a screen for modifiers of the rough eye phenotype. one of the suppressor genes identified was the drosophila orc2 gene. a search for known transcription factor recognition sites revealed that the orc2 gene contains three dres, named dre1 (+14 to +21), dre2 (-205 to -198), and dre3 (-709 to -702). band mobility shift analysis using kc cell nuclear extracts detected the specific complex formed between dref and the dre1 or dre2. specific binding of dref to genomic region containing the dre1 or dre2 was further demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting that these are the genuine complexes formed in vivo. the luciferase assay in kc cells indicated that the dre sites in the orc2 promoter are involved in a transcriptional regulation of the orc2 gene. the results, taken together, demonstrate that the orc2 gene is under the control of dref pathway.

the first step in the differentiation of the drosophila mesoderm is the activation of two regulatory genes, twist (twi) and snail (sna), in ventral regions of early embryos. sna is a transcriptional repressor that is uniformly expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm. its sharp lateral limits help to establish the boundary between the mesoderm and neuroectoderm. genetic studies suggest that sna is a target of the dorsal (dl) morphogen, and this interaction provides a model for determining how a morphogen gradient establishes a sharp, on/off threshold response. we present evidence that dl and twi directly activate sna expression. site-directed mutagenesis of dl- and twi-binding sites within defined regions of the sna promoter suggest that the two proteins (containing the rel and helix-loop-helix domains, respectively) function multiplicatively to ensure strong, uniform expression of sna, particularly in ventral-lateral regions where there are diminishing amounts of dl. these results are consistent with the possibility that the sharp sna borders are formed by multiplying the shallow dl gradient and the steeper twi gradient.

we have constructed hybrid genes in which the coding region of the bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) has been linked to varying lengths of upstream sequences of drosophila genes for larval serum sequence 1 (lsp1). these have been inserted into a p-element transformation vector and subsequently transferred into the germ-line of recipient flies. transformants carrying the cat gene linked to 1650 bp, 570 bp or 377 bp of upstream lsp1alpha sequences, or 745 bp or 471 bp of upstream beta sequences express cat with the same developmental and tissue specificity as the endogenous lsp1 genes. constructs having only 66 bp of upstream lsp1beta sequences, however, show extremely low levels of cat expression in tissues and at developmental stages in which lsp1 is not expressed. we discuss the significance of short regions of homology between the dna upstream of the alpha and beta genes, which lie within the regions identified by the transformation experiments as being required for the cis-regulation of lsp1 synthesis.

drosophila melanogaster has become one of the important model systems to investigate the development and differentiation of the heart. after 24h after egg deposition (h aed), a simple tube-like organ is formed, consisting of essentially only two cell types, the contractile cardioblasts and non-myogenic pericardial cells. in contrast to the detailed knowledge of heart formation during embryogenesis, only a few studies deal with later changes in heart morphology and/or function. this is mainly due to the difficulties to carry out whole mount stainings in later stages without complicated dissections or treatments of the cuticle and puparium. in this paper we describe the identification of a hand genomic region, which is fully sufficient to drive gfp expression in heart cells of embryos, larvae, and adults. this serves as an initial step to understand the position of hand in the early regulatory network in heart development. furthermore, we demonstrate that our newly created gfp reporter line is extremely useful to study postembryonic heart differentiation. for the first time we document heart differentiation in living animals throughout all developmental stages of drosophila melanogaster, including embryogenesis, all three larval stages, metamorphosis, and the adult life with respect to pericardial cells and cardiomyocytes.

the genes don juan (dj) and don juan like (djl) encode basic proteins expressed in the male germline. both proteins show a similar expression pattern being localized in the sperm heads during chromatin condensation and along the flagella. prematurely expressed don juan-egfp and myc-don juan like localize to the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and in mitochondrial derivatives from the nebenkern stage onward suggesting that both proteins associate with the mitochondria along the flagella in elongated spermatids. premature expression of myc-don juan like does not impair spermatogenesis where-as don juan-egfp when prematurely expressed causes male sterility as spermatids fail to individualize. in spite of the sequence identity of 72% on the nucleotide level and 42% on the protein level, the presumptive promoter regions and the untranslated regions of the mrna are diverged. our in vivo analysis revealed that don juan and don juan like are transcriptionally and translationally controlled by distinct short cis regulatory regions. transcription of don juan and don juan like depends on the male germ line specific taf(ii)80, cannonball (can). translational repression elements for both mrnas are localized in the 5' utr and are capable to form distinct secondary structures in close proximity to the translational initiation codon.

the discovery of direct downstream targets of transcription factors (tfs) is necessary for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying complex, highly regulated processes such as development. in this report, we have used a combinatorial strategy to conduct a genome-wide search for novel direct targets of eyeless (ey), a key transcription factor controlling early eye development in drosophila. to overcome the lack of high-quality consensus binding site sequences, phylogenetic shadowing of known ey binding sites in sine oculis (so) was used to construct a position weight matrix (pwm) of the ey protein. this pwm was then used for in silico prediction of potential binding sites in the drosophila melanogaster genome. to reduce the false positive rate, conservation of these potential binding sites was assessed by comparing the genomic sequences from seven drosophila species. in parallel, microarray analysis of wild-type versus ectopic ey-expressing tissue, followed by microarray-based epistasis experiments in an atonal (ato) mutant background, identified 188 genes induced by ey. intersection of in silico predicted conserved ey binding sites with the candidate gene list produced through expression profiling yields a list of 20 putative ey-induced, eye-enriched, ato-independent, direct targets of ey. the accuracy of this list of genes was confirmed using both in vitro and in vivo methods. initial analysis reveals three genes, eyes absent, shifted, and optix, as novel direct targets of ey. these results suggest that the integrated strategy of computational biology, genomics, and genetics is a powerful approach to identify direct downstream targets for any transcription factor genome-wide.

a gradient of the maternal morphogen dorsal (dl) initiates the differentiation of various tissues along the dorsal-ventral axis of early drosophila embryos. dl is a sequence-specific dna-binding protein that is related to the mammalian regulatory factor nf-kappa b. previous studies suggest that dl can function as a transcriptional repressor. to determine how dl functions as an activator we have examined the promoter of the mesoderm determinant gene twist (twi). genetic studies suggest that peak levels of dl protein in ventral regions of early embryos initiate twi expression. using a combination of promoter fusion-p-transformation assays, and in vitro dna-binding assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we establish a direct link between dl-binding sites and twi expression in the early embryo. we also present evidence that the dorsal-ventral limits of twi expression depend on the number and affinity of dl-binding sites present in its promoter. a comparison of twi with a second dl target gene, zen, suggests a correlation between the affinities of dl-binding sites and response to different thresholds of dl morphogen.

twist is one of the earliest expressed zygotically active genes required for dorsal-ventral pattern formation in the drosophila embryo. genetic studies suggest that this gene is activated in the ventral part of the blastoderm by maternally expressed dorsal gene product. using p-element-mediated germ-line transformation, we have mapped a small (260 bp) dorsal-dependent ventral activator region (var) in the 5'-flanking region of the twist promoter that can direct the early ventral expression of a heterologous promoter. the var contains binding sites for a number of proteins present in extracts of drosophila embryos. one of these sites bears homology to known binding sites for the dorsal transcription factor and is specifically bound by bacterially expressed dorsal protein. furthermore, a 37-bp deletion that removes the dorsal-binding sequences abolishes the ventral-specific activity of the twist promoter constructs. our data also show that additional sequences within the var are required to render the dorsal-binding sites functional. finally, reverse genetic and biochemical data suggest that the transcription factor, encoded by the zeste gene may help control the overall level, if not the pattern, of twist expression.

patterning of the drosophila embryonic mesoderm requires the regulation of cell type-specific factors in response to dorsoventral and anteroposterior axis information. for the dorsoventral axis, the homeodomain gene, tinman, is a key patterning mediator for dorsal mesodermal fates like the heart. however, equivalent mediators for more ventral fates are unknown. we show that d-six4, which encodes a six family transcription factor, is required for the appropriate development of most cell types deriving from the non-dorsal mesoderm - the fat body, somatic cells of the gonad, and a specific subset of somatic muscles. misexpression analysis suggests that d-six4 and its likely cofactor, eyes absent, are sufficient to impose these fates on other mesodermal cells. at stage 10, the mesodermal expression patterns of d-six4 and tin are complementary, being restricted to the dorsal and non-dorsal regions respectively. our data suggest that d-six4 is a key mesodermal patterning mediator at this stage that regulates a variety of cell-type-specific factors and hence plays an equivalent role to tin. at stage 9, however, d-six4 and tin are both expressed pan-mesodermally. at this stage, tin function is required for full d-six4 expression. this may explain the known requirement for tin in some non-dorsal cell types.

the molecular basis of programmed cell death (pcd) of neurons during early metamorphic development of the central nervous system (cns) in drosophila melanogaster are largely unknown, in part owing to the lack of appropriate model systems. here, we provide evidence showing that a group of neurons (vcrz) that express neuropeptide corazonin (crz) gene in the ventral nerve cord of the larval cns undergo programmed death within 6 hours of the onset of metamorphosis. the death was prevented by targeted expression of caspase inhibitor p35, suggesting that these larval neurons are eliminated via a caspase-dependent pathway. genetic and transgenic disruptions of ecdysone signal transduction involving ecdysone receptor-b (ecr-b) isoforms suppressed vcrz death, whereas transgenic re-introduction of either ecr-b1 or ecr-b2 isoform into the ecr-b-null mutant resumed normal death. expression of reaper in vcrz neurons and suppression of vcrz-cell death in a reaper-null mutant suggest that reaper functions are required for the death, while no apparent role was found for hid or grim as a death promoter. our data further suggest that diap1 does not play a role as a central regulator of the pcd of vcrz neurons. significant delay of vcrz-cell death was observed in mutants that lack dronc or dark functions, indicating that formation of an apoptosome is necessary, but not sufficient, for timely execution of the death. these results suggest that activated ecdysone signaling determines precise developmental timing of the neuronal degeneration during early metamorphosis, and that subsequent reaper-mediated caspase activation occurs through a novel diap1-independent pathway.

to examine whether caffeine, the most widely used xenobiotic compound, would induce insect cytochrome p450 or cyp gene expression, upstream dna fragments of cyp6a2 (0.12, 0.26, 0.52 and 0.98-kb) and cyp6a8 (0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8-kb) genes of drosophila melanogaster were individually fused to the firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene. promoter activities of these constructs were examined in drosophila sl-2 cells using luciferase assays. activity of 0.2- and 0.8-kb upstream dna of cyp6a8 was also measured in transgenic female flies. when these flies were treated with 2 mm pure caffeine or vivarin caffeine, both dna fragments showed a 4-5-fold induction of promoter activity. endogenous cyp6a8 and cyp6a2 genes in these flies also showed caffeine-induced expression. in addition, both 0.2- and 0.8-kb dnas showed differential basal and caffeine-induced activity in head, ovaries, gut, cuticle plus fat body and malpighian tubules. however, in all tissues 0.8-kb dna always showed higher basal and caffeine-induced activities compared to the 0.2-kb dna, suggesting that the additional dna present in the 0.8-kb fragment has sequences that enhance both activities. in sl-2 cells, all reporter constructs of each cyp6 gene showed significantly higher basal activity than the empty vector. sequences that boost basal activity are located in -265/-129 and -983/-522 dna of cyp6a2, and -199/-109 and -491/-199 dna of cyp6a8 genes. while the 0.12- and 0.1-kb upstream dnas of cyp6a2 and cyp6a8 genes respectively did not show caffeine-inducibility in sl-2 cells, the longest upstream dna of each gene gave the highest level of induction. caffeine-responsive sequences are not clustered at one place; they appear to be dispersed in -983/-126 and -761/-109 regions of cyp6a2 and cyp6a8 genes which also contain many binding sites for activator protein 1 (ap1) and cyclic amp response element binding protein (cre-bp). significance of these binding sites in caffeine-inducibility has been discussed.

autoregulation has been implicated in the expression of many patterning genes in drosophila, but the molecular details of this process are largely unknown. in the case of the segmentation gene even-skipped (eve), autoregulation is important for the specification of sharp stripes of gene expression at the onset of gastrulation. here, we use a combination of dna binding and p-transformation assays to characterize the cis- and trans-acting factors responsible for autoregulation. we show that eve autoregulation is mediated, at least in part, by a 100-bp minimal autoregulatory sequence (mas) located approximately 5 kb upstream from the eve transcription start site. multimerization of a 200-bp dna fragment that encompasses the mas drives optimal autoregulatory activity, comparable to that obtained with the native distal enhancer element located between -5.9 and -5.2 kb. the mas contains two eve protein-binding sites, as well as binding sites for two nuclear factors present in early embryos. directed mutagenesis of these binding sites suggests that both the eve protein and nuclear factors are essential for autoregulation. these results provide evidence that the eve protein acts combinatorially with other transcription factors to enhance its own expression.

friend of gata proteins interact with gata factors to regulate development in a variety of tissues. we analyzed cis- and trans-regulation of the drosophila gene, u-shaped, to better understand the transcriptional control of this important gene family during hematopoiesis. using overlapping genomic fragments driving tissue-specific reporter-gene (lacz) expression, we identified two minimal hematopoietic enhancers within the 7.4 kb region upstream of the transcription start site. one enhancer was active in all classes of hemocytes, whereas the other was active in hemocyte precursors and plasmatocytes only. the gata factor, serpent, directly regulated the activity of both enhancers. however, activity in the crystal cell lineage not only required serpent but also the runx homologue, lozenge. this is the first demonstration of gata and runx direct regulation of friend of gata gene expression and provides additional evidence for the combinatorial control of crystal cell lineage commitment by serpent, lozenge, and u-shaped. in addition, we analyzed cis-regulation of ush expression in the lymph gland and identified similarities and differences between regulatory strategies used during embryonic and lymph gland hematopoiesis. the results of these studies provide information to analyze further the regulation of this conserved gene family and its role during hematopoietic lineage commitment.

"while combinatorial models of transcriptional regulation can be inferred for metazoan systems from a priori biological knowledge, validation requires extensive and time-consuming experimental work. thus, there is a need for computational methods that can evaluate hypothesized cis regulatory codes before the difficult task of experimental verification is undertaken. we have developed a novel computational framework (termed ""codefinder"") that integrates transcription factor binding site and gene expression information to evaluate whether a hypothesized transcriptional regulatory model (trm; i.e., a set of co-regulating transcription factors) is likely to target a given set of co-expressed genes. our basic approach is to simultaneously predict cis regulatory modules (crms) associated with a given gene set and quantify the enrichment for combinatorial subsets of transcription factor binding site motifs comprising the hypothesized trm within these predicted crms. as a model system, we have examined a trm experimentally demonstrated to drive the expression of two genes in a sub-population of cells in the developing drosophila mesoderm, the somatic muscle founder cells. this trm was previously hypothesized to be a general mode of regulation for genes expressed in this cell population. in contrast, the present analyses suggest that a modified form of this cis regulatory code applies to only a subset of founder cell genes, those whose gene expression responds to specific genetic perturbations in a similar manner to the gene on which the original model was based. we have confirmed this hypothesis by experimentally discovering six (out of 12 tested) new crms driving expression in the embryonic mesoderm, four of which drive expression in founder cells."

dissecting components of key transcriptional networks is essential for understanding complex developmental processes and phenotypes. genetic studies have highlighted the role of members of the mef2 family of transcription factors as essential regulators in myogenesis from flies to man. to understand how these transcription factors control diverse processes in muscle development, we have combined chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with gene expression profiling to obtain a temporal map of mef2 activity during drosophila embryonic development. this global approach revealed three temporal patterns of mef2 enhancer binding, providing a glimpse of dynamic enhancer use within the context of a developing embryo. our results provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of mef2's activity at the level of dna binding and suggest cooperativity with the bhlh protein twist. the number and diversity of new direct target genes indicates a much broader role for mef2, at all stages of myogenesis, than previously anticipated.

a 631-bp fragment containing the 5'-flanking region of the drosophila melanogaster proliferating-cell nuclear antigen (pcna) gene was placed upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene of a cat vector. a transient expression assay of cat activity in drosophila kc cells transfected with this plasmid and a set of 5'-deletion derivatives revealed that the promoter function resided within a 192-bp region (-168 to +24 with respect to the transcription initiation site). cotransfection with a zerknüllt (zen)-expressing plasmid specifically repressed cat expression. however, cotransfection with expression plasmids for a nonfunctional zen mutation, even-skipped, or bicoid showed no significant effect on cat expression. rnase protection analysis revealed that the repression by zen was at the transcription step. the target sequence of zen was mapped within the 34-bp region (-119 to -86) of the pcna gene promoter, even though it lacked zen protein-binding sites. transgenic flies carrying the pcna gene regulatory region (-607 to +137 or -168 to +137) fused with lacz were established. when these flies were crossed with the zen mutant, ectopic expression of lacz was observed in the dorsal region of gastrulating embryos carrying the transgene with either construct. these results indicate that zen indirectly represses pcna gene expression, probably by regulating the expression of some transcription factor(s) that binds to the pcna gene promoter.

drosophila adult structures derive from imaginal discs, which are sacs with apposed epithelial sheets, the disc proper (dp) and the peripodial epithelium (pe). the drosophila tgf-beta family member decapentaplegic (dpp) contributes to the development of adult structures through expression in all imaginal discs, driven by enhancers from the 3' cis-regulatory region of the gene. in the eye/antennal disc, there is 3' directed dpp expression in both the dp and pe associated with cell proliferation and eye formation. here, we analyze a new class of dpp cis-regulatory mutations, which specifically disrupt a previously unknown region of dpp expression, controlled by enhancers in the 5' regulatory region of the gene and limited to the pe of eye/antennal discs. these are the first described drosophila mutations that act by solely disrupting pe gene expression. the mutants display defects in the ventral adult head and alter peripodial but not dp expression of known dpp targets. however, apoptosis is observed in the underlying dp, suggesting that this peripodial dpp signaling source supports cell survival in the dp.

hox genes have been implicated in the evolution of many animal body patterns, but the molecular events underlying trait modification have not been elucidated. pigmentation of the posterior male abdomen is a recently acquired trait in the drosophila melanogaster lineage. here, we show that the abdominal-b (abd-b) hox protein directly activates expression of the yellow pigmentation gene in posterior segments. abd-b regulation of pigmentation evolved through the gain of abd-b binding sites in a specific cis-regulatory element of the yellow gene of a common ancestor of sexually dimorphic species. within the melanogaster species group, male-specific pigmentation has subsequently been lost by at least three different mechanisms, including the mutational inactivation of a key abd-b binding site in one lineage. these results demonstrate how hox regulation of traits and target genes is gained and lost at the species level and have general implications for the evolution of body form at higher taxonomic levels.

temperature profoundly influences various life phenomena, and most animals have developed mechanisms to respond properly to environmental temperature fluctuations. to identify genes involved in sensing ambient temperature and in responding to its change, >27,000 independent p-element insertion mutants of drosophila were screened. as a result, we found that defects in the genes encoding for proteins involved in histamine signaling [histidine decarboxylase (hdc), histamine-gated chloride channel subunit 1 (hiscl1), ora transientless (ort)] cause abnormal temperature preferences. the abnormal preferences shown in these mutants were restored by genetic and pharmacological rescue and could be reproduced in wild type using the histamine receptor inhibitors cimetidine and hydroxyzine. spatial expression of these genes was observed in various brain regions including pars intercerebralis, fan-shaped body, and circadian clock neurons but not in dtrpa1-expressing neurons, an essential element for thermotaxis. we also found that the histaminergic mutants showed reduced tolerance for high temperature and enhanced tolerance for cold temperature. together, these results suggest that histamine signaling may have important roles in modulating temperature preference and in controlling tolerance of low and high temperature.

boundaries of ultrabithorax expression are mediated by long-range repression acting through the pbx or abx control region. we show here that either of these control regions confers an early band of beta-galactosidase expression which is restricted along the anteroposterior axis of the blastoderm embryo. this band is succeeded by a stripe pattern with very similar anteroposterior limits. dissection of the pbx control region demonstrates that the two patterns are conferred by distinct cis-regulatory sequences contained within separate pbx subfragments. we find several binding sites for hunchback protein within both pbx subfragments. zygotic hunchback function is required to prevent ectopic pbx expression. moreover, the pbx pattern is completely suppressed in embryos containing uniformly distributed maternal hunchback protein. our results strongly suggest that hunchback protein directly binds to the pbx control region and acts as a repressor to specify the boundary positions of the pbx pattern.

the homeotic gene labial (lab) is required for proper development of the embryonic and adult head in drosophila melanogaster. the lab gene product accumulates in a complex pattern in both embryonic and imaginal tissue. during embryogenesis, lab is expressed in the endodermally derived cells of the midgut, in ectodermally derived cells of the procephalon and dorsal ridge, and in a small subset of progenitor sensory cells. imaginal expression is restricted to a narrow region of the peripodial membrane of the eye-antennal disc. as part of our continuing effort to understand the role of lab in development, we have begun a dissection of the regulatory elements of the lab transcription unit and used germ line transformation experiments to determine which aspects of the observed expression pattern are essential for proper head development and viability. transgenic embryos harboring an abridged lab gene are able to overcome the embryonic lethality associated with the loss of lab function and survive to adulthood. interestingly, in these transgenic lines the lab protein accumulates only in a subset of those embryonic cells that normally express the gene, namely the procephalon and the anterior midgut. we also find that, once initiated, lab expression is maintained by positive autoregulation. although lab minigene activity is sufficient to rescue the embryonic lethality of lab mutations, the transgenes fail to rescue defects in the adult head capsule. however, the defects observed in this study encompass a broader domain than those seen using somatic recombination to generate lab- clonal tissue. the failed rescue and observed cuticular defects are, at least in part, explained by the observation that the transgenes, rather than failing to be expressed, are associated with ectopic accumulation of lab protein in the peripodial membrane of the antennal disc. moreover, this aberrant expression pattern is correlated with the abnormal expression of two other homeotic genes, deformed (dfd) and sex combs reduced (scr) in the eye-antennal disc. these results are only observed when the transgene is resident in a lab- genotype and ectopic expression of lab and misregulation of dfd and scr are not seen in a lab+ background. this result suggests that the wild-type lab gene product is necessary for the normal regulation of the locus in the imaginal discs, but unlike the case in the embryo, the event is negative. we discuss the biological implications of these results in relation to the role of lab in development.

the homeobox transcription factor tinman plays an important role in the initiation of heart development. later functions of tinman, including the target genes involved in cardiac physiology, are less well studied. we focused on the dsur gene, which encodes an atp-binding cassette transmembrane protein that is expressed in the heart. mammalian sur genes are associated with k(atp) (atp-sensitive potassium) channels, which are involved in metabolic homeostasis. we provide experimental evidence that tinman directly regulates dsur expression in the developing heart. we identified a cis-regulatory element in the first intron of dsur, which contains tinman consensus binding sites and is sufficient for faithful dsur expression in the fly's myocardium. site-directed mutagenesis of this element shows that these tinman sites are critical to dsur expression, and further genetic manipulations suggest that the gata transcription factor pannier is synergistically involved in cardiac-restricted dsur expression in vivo. physiological analysis of dsur knock-down flies supports the idea that dsur plays a protective role against hypoxic stress and pacing-induced heart failure. because dsur expression dramatically decreases with age, it is likely to be a factor involved in the cardiac aging phenotype of drosophila. dsur provides a model for addressing how embryonic regulators of myocardial cell commitment can contribute to the establishment and maintenance of cardiac performance.

in context of the semi-sterility exhibited by drosophila males expressing certain mating-enabling fruitless (fru) mutant genotypes, we examined the transfer of seminal fluid using a transgene that encodes the sex peptide (sp) oligopeptide fused to green fluorescent protein (gfp). we found that this fusion construct expresses sp-gfp in a valid manner within accessory glands of the male reproductive system in normal and fru-mutant males. transfer of sp-gfp to live females was readily detectable during and after copulation. with respect to the pertinent combinations of fru mutations, we demonstrated that these abnormal genotypes cause males to transmit mating-related materials in two aberrant ways: one involving whether any seminal-fluid entities are transferred at all during a given mating; the other revealing an intriguing aspect of these fruitless effects, such that the mutations in question cause males to transfer female-affecting materials in a manner that varies among copulations. in this regard, certain mutant males that do not transfer sp nevertheless are able to transfer sperm: a fru-mated female possessing no gfp who was not fecund initially could produce progeny when seminal-fluid proteins were subsequently supplied by mating with a male that was spermless owing to the effects of a tudor mutation.

(fkh) is required to block salivary gland apoptosis, internalize salivary gland precursors, prevent expression of duct genes in secretory cells and maintain expression of creba, which is required for elevated secretory function. here, we characterize two new fkh-dependent genes: ph4alphasg1 and ph4alphasg2. we show through in vitro dna-binding studies and in vivo expression assays that fkh cooperates with the salivary gland-specific bhlh protein sage to directly regulate expression of ph4alphasg2, as well as sage itself, and to indirectly regulate expression of ph4alphasg1. ph4alphasg1 and ph4alphasg2 encode alpha-subunits of resident er enzymes that hydroxylate prolines in collagen and other secreted proteins. we demonstrate that salivary gland secretions are altered in embryos missing function of ph4alphasg1 and ph4alphasg2; secretory content is reduced and shows increased electron density by tem. interestingly, the altered secretory content results in regions of tube dilation and constriction, with intermittent tube closure. the regulation studies and phenotypic characterization of ph4alphasg1 and ph4alphasg2 link fkh, which initiates tube formation, to the maintenance of an open and uniformly sized secretory tube.

it is well established that developmental programs act during embryogenesis to determine animal morphogenesis. how these developmental cues produce specific cell shape during morphogenesis, however, has remained elusive. we addressed this question by studying the morphological differentiation of the drosophila epidermis, governed by a well-known circuit of regulators leading to a stereotyped pattern of smooth cells and cells forming actin-rich extensions (trichomes). it was shown that the transcription factor shavenbaby plays a pivotal role in the formation of trichomes and underlies all examined cases of the evolutionary diversification of their pattern. to gain insight into the mechanisms of morphological differentiation, we sought to identify shavenbaby's downstream targets. we show here that shavenbaby controls epidermal cell shape, through the transcriptional activation of different classes of cellular effectors, directly contributing to the organization of actin filaments, regulation of the extracellular matrix, and modification of the cuticle. individual inactivation of shavenbaby's targets produces distinct trichome defects and only their simultaneous inactivation prevent trichome formation. our data show that shavenbaby governs an evolutionarily conserved developmental module consisting of a set of genes collectively responsible for trichome formation, shedding new light on molecular mechanisms acting during morphogenesis and the way they can influence evolution of animal forms.

ecdysteroids regulate many key developmental events in arthropods including molting and metamorphosis. recently, members of the drosophila halloween group of genes, that are required for embryonic viability and cuticle deposition, have been shown to code for several cytochrome p450 enzymes that catalyze the terminal hydroxylation steps in the conversion of cholesterol to the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. these p450s are conserved in other insects and each is thought to function throughout development as the sole mediator of a particular biosynthetic step since, where analyzed, each is expressed at all stages of development and shows no closely related homolog in their respective genomes. in contrast, we show here that several dipteran genomes encode two novel, highly related, microsomal p450 enzymes, cyp307a1 and cyp307a2, that likely participate as stage-specific components of the ecdysone biosynthetic machinery. this hypothesis comes from the observation that cyp307a1 is encoded by the halloween gene spook (spo), but unlike other halloween class genes, dmspo is not expressed during the larval stages. in contrast, cyp307a2, dubbed spookier (spok), is expressed primarily during larval stages within the prothoracic gland cells of the ring gland. rnai mediated reduction in the expression of this heterochromatin localized gene leads to arrest at the first instar stage which can be rescued by feeding the larva 20e, e or ketodiol but not 7dc. in addition, spok expression is eliminated in larvae carrying mutations in molting defective (mld), a gene encoding a nuclear zinc finger protein that is required for production of ecdysone during drosophila larval development. intriguingly, mld is not present in the bombyx mori genome, and we have identified only one spook homolog in both bombyx and manduca that is expressed in both embryos and larva. these studies suggest an evolutionary split between diptera and lepidoptera in how the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway is regulated during development.

skpa is component of a drosophila scf complex that functions in combination with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubcd1. skpa null mutation results in centrosome overduplication, unusual chromatin condensation, defective endoreduplication and cell-cycle progression. while the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the skpa gene are poorly understood, the dna replication-related element (dre) and the dre-binding factor (dref) play important roles in regulating proliferation-related genes in drosophila and dre (5'-tatcgata) and dre-like (5'-catcgatt) sequences were here found to be involved in skpa promoter activity. thus both luciferase transient expression assays in cultured drosophila s2 cells using skpa promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids and anti-lacz immunostaining of various tissues from transgenic third instar larvae carrying the skpa promoter-lacz fusion genes provided supportive evidence. furthermore, anti-skpa immunostaining of eye imaginal discs from flies overexpressing dref showed ectopic expression of protein in the region posterior to the morphogenetic furrow where dref is overexpressed. knockdown of dref in some tissues where skpa distribution is well known almost completely abrogated the skpa gene expression. these findings, taken together, indicate that the drosophila skpa gene is a novel target of the transcription factor dref.

loss of the epithelial polarity gene scribble in clones of drosophila imaginal disc cells can cooperate with ras signaling to induce malignant tumors. such mutant tissue overproliferates, resists apoptosis, leaves its place of origin and invades other organs, ultimately causing lethality. we show that increased jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) signaling resulting from the loss of scribble promotes the movement of transformed cells to secondary sites. this effect requires fos-dependent transcriptional activation of a matrix metalloprotease gene mmp1 downstream of jnk. expression of the mmp inhibitor timp or mmp rnai knockdown suppresses cell invasiveness. the proinvasive function of the jnk pathway is revealed in a tumor context when active ras signaling prevents the apoptotic response to jnk activity as it occurs in nontransformed cells. based on these results, we present a model that explains the oncogenic cooperation between jnk and ras, and describes how aberrant regulation of cell survival, proliferation and mobilization cooperate to incite malignant tumor formation.

the transformation of antenna to leg is a classical model for understanding segmental fate decisions in drosophila. the spineless (ss) gene encodes a bhlh-pas transcription factor that plays a key role in specifying the identity of distal antennal segments. in this report, we identify the antennal disc enhancer of ss and then use enhancer-lacz reporters to work out how ss antennal expression is regulated. the antennal determinants distal-less (dll) and homothorax (hth) are key activators of the antennal enhancer. dll is required continuously and, when present at elevated levels, can activate the enhancer in regions devoid of hth expression. in contrast, homothorax (hth) is required only transiently both for activation of the enhancer and for specification of the aristal portion of the antenna. the antennal enhancer is repressed by cut, which determines its proximal limit of expression, and by ectopic antennapedia (antp). repression by antp is not mediated by hth, suggesting that ss may be a direct target of antp. finally, we show that ss+ is not a purely passive target of its regulators: ss+ partially represses hth in the third antennal segment and lies upstream of dll in the development of the maxillary palp primordia.

morphogen gradients determine a range of cell fates by specifying multiple transcriptional threshold responses. in the dorsal ectoderm of the drosophila embryo, a bmp gradient is translated into an activated smad transcription factor gradient, which elicits at least three threshold responses - high, intermediate and low. however, the mechanism underlying differential response to dpp is poorly understood, due in part to the insufficient number of well-studied target genes. we analyzed the regulation of the c15 gene, which can be activated in cells containing intermediate levels of dpp. we show that c15 expression requires both dpp and zen, thus forming a genetic feed-forward loop. the c15 regulatory element contains clusters of smad- and zen-binding sites in close proximity. mutational analysis shows that the number of intact smad- and zen-binding sites is essential for the c15 transcriptional response, and that the spatial limits of c15 expression are established through a repression mechanism in the dorsolateral cells of the embryo. thus, the combinatorial action of smad and zen activators bound to a number of adjacent sites, and competing negative cues allows for proper gene response to lower than peak levels of the dpp morphogen.

background: the regulation of proneural gene expression is an important aspect of neurogenesis. in the study of the drosophila proneural genes, scute and atonal, several themes have emerged that contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of neurogenesis. first, spatial complexity in proneural expression results from regulation by arrays of enhancer elements. secondly, regulation of proneural gene expression occurs in distinct temporal phases, which tend to be under the control of separate enhancers. thirdly, the later phase of proneural expression often relies on positive autoregulation. the control of these phases and the transition between them appear to be central to the mechanism of neurogenesis. we present the first investigation of the regulation of the proneural gene, amos. results: amos protein expression has a complex pattern and shows temporally distinct phases, in common with previously characterised proneural genes. gfp reporter gene constructs were used to demonstrate that amos has an array of enhancer elements up- and downstream of the gene, which are required for different locations of amos expression. however, unlike other proneural genes, there is no evidence for separable enhancers for the different temporal phases of amos expression. using mutant analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of potential amos binding sites, we find no evidence for positive autoregulation as an important part of amos control during neurogenesis. conclusion: for amos, as for other proneural genes, a complex expression pattern results from the sum of a number of simpler sub-patterns driven by specific enhancers. there is, however, no apparent separation of enhancers for distinct temporal phases of expression, and this correlates with a lack of positive autoregulation. for scute and atonal, both these features are thought to be important in the mechanism of neurogenesis. despite similarities in function and expression between the drosophila proneural genes, amos is regulated in a fundamentally different way from scute and atonal.

a complex regulatory cascade is required for normal cardiac development, and many aspects of this network are conserved from drosophila to mammals. in drosophila, the seven-up (svp) gene, an ortholog of the vertebrate chick ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (coup-tfi and ii), is initially activated in the cardiac mesoderm and is subsequently restricted to cells forming the cardiac inflow tracts. here, we investigate svp regulation in the developing cardiac tube. using bioinformatics, we identify a 1007-bp enhancer of svp which recapitulates its entire expression in the embryonic heart and other mesodermal derivatives, and we show that this enhancer is initially activated by the nk homeodomain factor tinman (tin) via two conserved tin binding sites. mutation of the tin binding sites significantly reduces enhancer activity both during normal development and in response to ectopic tin. this is the first identification of an enhancer for the complex svp gene, demonstrating the effectiveness of bioinformatics tools in assisting in unraveling transcriptional regulatory networks. our studies define a critical component of the svp regulatory cascade and place gene regulatory events in direct apposition to the formation of critical cardiac structures.

changes in cis-regulatory sequences are proposed to underlie much of morphological evolution. yet, little is known about how such modifications translate into phenotypic differences. to address this problem, we focus on the dorsocentral bristles of drosophilidae. in drosophila melanogaster, development of these bristles depends on a cis-regulatory element, the dorsocentral enhancer, to activate scute in a cluster of cells from which two bristles on the posterior scutum arise. a few species however, such as d. quadrilineata, bear anterior dorsocentral bristles as well as posterior ones, a derived feature. this correlates with an anterior expansion of the scute expression domain. here, we show that the d. quadrilineata enhancer has evolved, and is now active in more anterior regions. when used to rescue scute expression in transgenic d. melanogaster, the d. quadrilineata enhancer is able to induce anterior bristles. importantly, these properties are not displayed by homologous enhancers from control species bearing only two posterior bristles. we also provide evidence that upstream regulation of the enhancer, by the gata transcription factor pannier, has been evolutionarily conserved. this work illustrates how, in the context of a conserved trans-regulatory landscape, evolutionary tinkering of pre-existing enhancers can modify gene expression patterns and contribute to morphological diversification.

during eye development, the selector factors of the eyeless/pax6 or retinal determination (rd) network control specification of organ-type whereas the bhlh-type proneural factor atonal drives neurogenesis. although significant progress has been made in dissecting the acquisition of ;eye identity' at the transcriptional level, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from neuronal progenitor to differentiating neuron remain unclear. a recently proposed model for the integration of organ specification and neurogenesis hypothesizes that atonal expression in the eye is rd-network-independent and that eyeless works in parallel or downstream of atonal to modify the neurogenetic program. we show here that distinct cis-regulatory elements control atonal expression specifically in the eye and that the rd factors eyeless and sine oculis function as direct regulators. we find that these transcription factors interact in vitro and provide indirect evidence that this interaction may be required in vivo. the subordination of neurogenesis to the rd pathway in the eye provides a direct mechanism for the coordination of neurogenesis and tissue specification during sensory organ formation.

the expression of drosophila neuropeptide ayrkppfngsifamide (sifamide) was shown by both immunohistology and in situ hybridization to be restricted to only four neurons of the pars intercerebralis. the role of sifamide in adult courtship behavior in both sexes was studied using two different approaches to perturb the function of sifamide; targeted cell ablation and rna interference (rnai). elimination of sifamide by either of these methods results in promiscuous flies; males perform vigorous and indiscriminant courtship directed at either sex, while females appear sexually hyper-receptive. these results demonstrate that sifamide is responsible for these behavioral effects and that the four sifamidergic neurons and arborizations play an important function in the neuronal circuitry controlling drosophila sexual behavior.

in drosophila, the ventral nerve cord (vnc) architecture is built from neuroblasts that are specified during embryonic development, mainly by transcription factors. here we show that engrailed, a homeodomain transcription factor known to be involved in the establishment of neuroblast identity, is also directly implicated in the regulation of axonal guidance cues. posterior commissures (pc) are missing in engrailed mutant embryos, and axonal pathfinding defects are observed when engrailed is ectopically expressed at early stages, prior to neuronal specification. we also show that frazzled, enabled, and trio, all of which are potential direct targets of engrailed and are involved in axonal navigation, interact genetically with engrailed to form posterior commissures in the developing vnc. the regulation of frazzled expression in engrailed-expressing neuroblasts contributes significantly to the formation of the posterior commissures by acting on axon growth. finally, we identified a small genomic fragment within intron 1 of frazzled that can mediate activation by engrailed in vivo when fused to a gfp reporter. these results indicate that engrailed's function during the segregation of the neuroblasts is crucial for regulating different actors that are later involved in axon guidance.

hox proteins have been proposed to act at multiple levels within regulatory hierarchies and to directly control the expression of a plethora of target genes. however, for any specific hox protein or tissue, very few direct in vivo-regulated target genes have been identified. here, we have identified target genes of the hox protein ultrabithorax (ubx), which modifies the genetic regulatory network of the wing to generate the haltere, a modified hindwing. we used whole-genome microarrays and custom arrays including all predicted transcription factors and signaling molecules in the drosophila melanogaster genome to identify differentially expressed genes in wing and haltere imaginal discs. to elucidate the regulation of selected genes in more detail, we isolated cis-regulatory elements (cres) for genes that were specifically expressed in either the wing disc or haltere disc. we demonstrate that ubx binds directly to sites in one element, and these sites are critical for activation in the haltere disc. these results indicate that haltere and metathoracic segment morphology is not achieved merely by turning off the wing and mesothoracic development programs, but rather specific genes must also be activated to form these structures. the evolution of haltere morphology involved changes in ubx-regulated target genes, both positive and negative, throughout the wing genetic regulatory network.

circular visceral muscles of drosophila are binuclear syncytia arising from fusion of two different kinds of myoblasts: a circular visceral founder cell and one visceral fusion-competent myoblast. in contrast to fusion leading to the somatic body-wall musculature, myoblast fusion for the circular visceral muscles does not result in massive syncytia but instead in syncytia interconnected with multiple cytoplasmic bridges, which differentiate into large web-shaped muscles. here, we show that these syncytial circular visceral muscles build a gut-enclosing network with the interwoven longitudinal visceral muscles. at the ultrastructural level, during circular visceral myoblast fusion and the first step of somatic myoblast fusion prefusion complexes and electron-dense plaques were not detectable which was surprising as these structures are characteristic for the second step of somatic myoblast fusion. moreover, we demonstrate that blown fuse (blow), a cytoplasmic protein essential for the second step of somatic myoblast fusion, plays a different role in circular visceral myogenesis. blow is known to be essential for progression beyond the prefusion complex in the somatic mesoderm; however, analysis of blow mutants established that it has a restricted role in stretching and outgrowth of the syncytia in the circular visceral muscles. furthermore, we also found that in the visceral mesoderm, blow is expressed in both the fusion-competent myoblasts and circular visceral founders, while expression in the somatic mesoderm is initially restricted to fusion-competent myoblasts. we also demonstrate that different enhancer elements in the first intron of blow are responsible for this distinct expression pattern. thus, we propose a model for blow in which this protein is involved in at least two clearly differing processes during drosophila muscle formation, namely somatic myoblast fusion on the one hand and stretching and outgrowth of circular visceral muscles on the other.

transposable elements are a major mutation source and powerful agents of adaptive change. some transposable element insertions in genomes increase to a high frequency because of the selective advantage the mutant phenotype provides. cyp6g1-mediated insecticide resistance in drosophila melanogaster is due to the upregulation of the cytochrome p450 gene cyp6g1, leading to the resistance to a variety of insecticide classes. the upregulation of cyp6g1 is correlated with the presence of the long terminal repeat (ltr) of an accord retrotransposon inserted 291bp upstream of the cyp6g1 transcription start site. this resistant allele (ddt-r) is currently at a high frequency in d. melanogaster populations around the world. here, we characterize the spatial expression of cyp6g1 in insecticide-resistant and -susceptible strains. we show that the accord ltr insertion is indeed the resistance-associated mutation and demonstrate that the accord ltr carries regulatory sequences that increase the expression of cyp6g1 in tissues important for detoxification, the midgut, malpighian tubules, and the fat body. this study provides a significant example of how changes in tissue-specific gene expression caused by transposable-element insertions can contribute to adaptation.

we show that a 2.6kb fragment of the muscle myosin heavy-chain gene (mhc) of drosophila melanogaster (containing 458 base pairs of upstream sequence, the first exon, the first intron and the beginning of the second exon) drives expression in all muscles. comparison of the minimal promoter to mhc genes of 10 drosophila species identified putative regulatory elements in the upstream region and in the first intron. the first intron is required for expression in four small cells of the tergal depressor of the trochanter (jump) muscle and in the indirect flight muscle. the 3'-end of this intron is important for mhc transcription in embryonic body wall muscle and contains at-rich elements that are protected from dnase i digestion by nuclear proteins of drosophila embryos. sequences responsible for expression in embryonic, adult body wall and adult head muscles are present both within and outside the intron. elements important for expression in leg muscles and in the large cells of the jump muscle flank the intron. we conclude that multiple transcriptional regulatory elements are responsible for mhc expression in specific sets of drosophila muscles.

we report the characterization of two novel genes of drosophila melanogaster, named mst36fa and mst36fb. they define a novel gene family, showing identical time and tissue-specificity limited to male germ cells where their transcription starts during meiotic prophase. these two genes encode for two slightly basic proteins highly homologous to each other and fairly rich in leucine and glutamic acid. although strictly clustered, these genes utilize different promoter regions as revealed by examination of transgenic flies bearing mst36f-promoter-lacz reporter constructs and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. our data suggest that at least one gene (mst36fa) of the cluster is under translational repression until spermiogenesis suggesting a putative role in the spermatides differentiation. the present study is aimed at the structural analysis of these genes.

caudal-related homeobox transcription factors are involved in the definition of the anteroposterior axis and intestinal development. recent reports indicate that dysregulation of cdx1 and cdx2, the human homologues of drosophila caudal, are associated with several types of cancer. very little is known, however, about the regulatory mechanisms that direct the caudal-related homeobox gene expression. in this study, we have identified the binding sites for bhlh-pas proteins, referred to as cns midline element (cme), in the 5'-flanking region of the drosophila caudal gene. analyses using transgenic flies carrying a caudal-lacz fusion gene bearing a wild-type or mutant cme indicate that the cme sites are required for caudal gene expression in vivo. we also determined that the caudal promoter activity can be regulated by trachealess (trh)/tango (tgo) bhlh-pas proteins, via the cme sites. our results suggest that the drosophila caudal gene is a target of the trh/tgo bhlh-pas proteins.

a maternally established gradient of nuclear dorsal protein is the first step in subdivision of the drosophila neurectoderm into stripes of homeodomain gene expression. dorsal in combination with the egf and tgfbeta signaling pathways are key regulators of the expression of the genes ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), and muscle segment homeobox (msh) in the developing neurectoderm. these three genes encode homeodomain transcription factors that can repress each other, which ensures adjacent, non-overlapping expression domains. expression of vnd, ind, and msh is maintained after decline in egf and tgfbeta signaling, but the relevant positive transcriptional regulators have not yet been defined. here, we show that ind can bind dna with the same sequence specificity as its murine ortholog gsh1. we have identified a novel upstream regulatory element at the ind locus containing predicted ind binding sites, and we show that ind activity is both necessary and sufficient for reporter gene expression from this element. we conclude that ind can act as a transcriptional activator, and that positive autoregulation of ind is a mechanism for persistent ind expression within the developing embryonic nervous system.

a remarkable problem in neurobiology is how olfactory receptor neurons (orns) select, from among a large odor receptor repertoire, which receptors to express. we use computational algorithms and mutational analysis to define positive and negative regulatory elements that are required for selection of odor receptor (or) genes in the proper olfactory organ of drosophila, and we identify an element that is essential for selection in one orn class. two odor receptors are coexpressed by virtue of the alternative splicing of a single gene, and we identify dicistronic mrnas that each encode two receptors. systematic analysis reveals no evidence for negative feedback regulation, but provides evidence that the choices made by neighboring orns of a sensillum are coordinated via the asymmetric segregation of regulatory factors from a common progenitor. we show that receptor gene choice in drosophila also depends on a combinatorial code of transcription factors to generate the receptor-to-neuron map.

genetic studies have identified numerous sequence-specific transcription factors that control development, yet little is known about their in vivo distribution across animal genomes. we determined the genome-wide occupancy of the dorsoventral (dv) determinants dorsal, twist, and snail in the drosophila embryo using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (chip-chip). the in vivo binding of these proteins correlate tightly with the limits of known enhancers. our analysis predicts substantially more target genes than previous estimates, and includes dpp signaling components and anteroposterior (ap) segmentation determinants. thus, the chip-chip data uncover a much larger than expected regulatory network, which integrates diverse patterning processes during development.

embryogenesis is controlled by large gene-regulatory networks, which generate spatially and temporally refined patterns of gene expression. here, we report the characteristics of the regulatory network orchestrating early mesodermal development in the fruitfly drosophila, where the transcription factor twist is both necessary and sufficient to drive development. through the integration of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis (chip-on-chip) experiments during discrete time periods with computational approaches, we identified >2000 twist-bound cis-regulatory modules (crms) and almost 500 direct target genes. unexpectedly, twist regulates an almost complete cassette of genes required for cell proliferation in addition to genes essential for morophogenesis and cell migration. twist targets almost 25% of all annotated drosophila transcription factors, which may represent the entire set of regulators necessary for the early development of this system. by combining in vivo binding data from twist, mef2, tinman, and dorsal we have constructed an initial transcriptional network of early mesoderm development. the network topology reveals extensive combinatorial binding, feed-forward regulation, and complex logical outputs as prevalent features. in addition to binary activation and repression, we suggest that twist binds to almost all mesodermal crms to provide the competence to integrate inputs from more specialized transcription factors.

in drosophila, restricted expression of the iroquois complex (iro-c) genes in the proximal region of the wing imaginal disc contributes to its territorial subdivision, specifying first the development of the notum versus the wing hinge, and subsequently, that of the lateral versus medial notum. iro-c expression is under the control of the egfr and dpp signalling pathways. to analyze how both pathways cooperate in the regulation of iro-c, we isolated several wing disc-specific cis-regulatory elements of the complex. one of these (irore(2)) integrates competing inputs of the egfr and dpp pathways, mediated by the transcription factors pointed (downstream of egfr pathway) and pannier/u-shaped and mothers against dpp (mad), in the case of dpp. by contrast, a second element (irore(1)) mediates activation by both the egfr and dpp pathways, thus promoting expression of iro-c in a region of elevated levels of dpp signalling, the prospective lateral notum near the anterior-posterior compartment boundary. these results help define the molecular mechanisms of the interplay between the egfr and dpp pathways in the specification and patterning of the notum.

the eye/antennal discs of drosophila form most of the adult head capsule. we are analyzing the role of the bmp family member decapentaplegic (dpp) in the process of head formation, as we have identified a class of cis-regulatory dpp mutations (dpp(s-hc)) that specifically disrupts expression in the lateral peripodial epithelium of eye/antennal discs and is required for ventral head formation. here we describe the recovery of mutations in odd-paired (opa), a zinc finger transcription factor related to the vertebrate zic family, as dominant enhancers of this dpp head mutation. a single loss-of-function opa allele in combination with a single copy of a dpp(s-hc) produces defects in the ventral adult head. furthermore, postembryonic loss of opa expression alone causes head defects identical to loss of dpp(s-hc)/dpp(s-hc), and dpp(hc)/+;opa/+ mutant combinations. opa is required for dpp expression in the lateral peripodial epithelium, but not other areas of the eye/antennal disc. thus a pathway that includes opa and dpp expression in the peripodial epithelium is crucial to the formation of the ventral adult head. zic proteins and members of the bmp pathway are crucial for vertebrate head development, as mutations in them are associated with midline defects of the head. the interaction of these genes in the morphogenesis of the fruitfly head suggests that the regulation of head formation may be conserved across metazoans.

the npc1 family of proteins plays crucial roles in the intestinal absorption and intracellular trafficking of sterols. the drosophila genome encodes two npc1 homologs, one of which, npc1a, is required for intracellular sterol trafficking in many tissues. here we show that the other drosophila npc1 family member, npc1b, is expressed in the midgut epithelium and that npc1b is essential for growth during the early larval stages of development. npc1b mutants are severely defective in sterol absorption, and the midgut epithelium of npc1b mutants is deficient in sterols and sterol trafficking intermediates. by contrast, npc1a mutants absorb sterols more efficiently than wild-type animals, and, unexpectedly, npc1b;npc1a double mutants absorb sterols as efficiently as wild-type animals. together, these findings suggest that npc1b plays an early role in sterol absorption, although sterol absorption continues at high efficiency through an npc1a- and npc1b-independent mechanism under conditions of impaired intracellular sterol trafficking.

from breathing to walking, rhythmic movements encompass physiological processes important across the entire animal kingdom. it is thought by many that the generation of rhythmic behavior is operated by a central pattern generator (cpg) and does not require peripheral sensory input. sensory feedback is, however, required to modify or coordinate the motor activity in response to the circumstances of actual movement. in contrast to this notion, we report here that sensory input is necessary for the generation of drosophila larval locomotion, a form of rhythmic behavior. blockage of all peripheral sensory inputs resulted in cessation of larval crawling. by conditionally silencing various subsets of larval peripheral sensory neurons, we identified the multiple dendritic (md) neurons as the neurons essential for the generation of rhythmic peristaltic locomotion. by recording the locomotive motor activities, we further demonstrate that removal of md neuron input disrupted rhythmic motor firing pattern in a way that prolonged the stereotyped segmental motor firing duration and prevented the propagation of posterior to anterior segmental motor firing. these findings reveal that md sensory neuron input is a necessary component in the neural circuitry that generates larval locomotion.

mechanisms regulating cns pattern formation and neural precursor formation are remarkably conserved between drosophila and vertebrates. however, to date, few direct connections have been made between genes that pattern the early cns and those that trigger neural precursor formation. here, we use drosophila to link directly the function of two evolutionarily conserved regulators of cns pattern along the dorsoventral axis, the homeodomain protein ind and the sox-domain protein dichaete, to the spatial regulation of the proneural gene achaete (ac) in the embryonic cns. we identify a minimal achaete regulatory region that recapitulates half of the wild-type ac expression pattern in the cns and find multiple putative dichaete-, ind-, and vnd-binding sites within this region. consensus dichaete sites are often found adjacent to those for vnd and ind, suggesting that dichaete associates with ind or vnd on target promoters. consistent with this finding, we observe that dichaete can physically interact with ind and vnd. finally, we demonstrate the in vivo requirement of adjacent dichaete and ind sites in the repression of ac gene expression in the cns. our data identify a direct link between the molecules that pattern the cns and those that specify distinct cell-types.

patterning of the respiratory dorsal appendages (das) on the drosophila melanogaster eggshell is tightly regulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) signaling. variation in the da number is observed among drosophila species; d. melanogaster has two das and d. virilis has four. diversification in the expression pattern of rhomboid (rho), which activates egfr signaling in somatic follicle cells, could cause the evolutionary divergence of da numbers. here we identified a cis-regulatory element of d. virilis rho. a comparison with d. melanogaster rho enhancer and activity studies in homologous and heterologous species suggested that these rho enhancers did not functionally diverge significantly during the evolution of these species. experiments using chimeric eggs composed of a d. virilis oocyte and d. melanogaster follicle cells showed the evolution of da number was not attributable to germline gurken (grk) signaling, but to divergence in events downstream of grk signaling affecting the rho enhancer activity in somatic follicle cells. we found that a transcription factor, mirror, which activates rho, could be one of these downstream factors. thus, evolution of the trans-regulatory environment that controls rho expression in somatic follicle cells could be a major contributor to the evolutionary changes in da number.

reproductive behavior in drosophila has both stereotyped and plastic components that are driven by age- and sex-specific chemical cues. males who unsuccessfully court virgin females subsequently avoid females that are of the same age as the trainer. in contrast, males trained with mature mated females associate volatile appetitive and aversive pheromonal cues and learn to suppress courtship of all females. here we show that the volatile aversive pheromone that leads to generalized learning with mated females is (z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cva). cva is a major component of the male cuticular hydrocarbon profile, but it is not found on virgin females. during copulation, cva is transferred to the female in ejaculate along with sperm and peptides that decrease her sexual receptivity. when males sense cva (either synthetic or from mated female or male extracts) in the context of female pheromone, they develop a generalized suppression of courtship. the effects of cva on initial courtship of virgin females can be blocked by expression of tetanus toxin in or65a, but not or67d neurons, demonstrating that the aversive effects of this pheromone are mediated by a specific class of olfactory neuron. these findings suggest that transfer of cva to females during mating may be part of the male's strategy to suppress reproduction by competing males.

the dna replication-related element (dre) is a common 8-bp sequence (5'-tatcgata) found in the promoters of many dna replication-related genes, to which dre-binding factor (dref) specifically binds to activate transcription. replication factor c (rfc) is an essential five-subunit complex in dna replication, the largest subunit being rfc140. we first identified the gene (rfc1) encoding the drosophila rfc140 (drfc140) protein and then isolated a mutant. the phenotypes suggested that the gene is essential for cell-cycle progression, and immunocytochemical studies also indicated a relation between its expression and the cell cycle. the rfc1 gene contains three dre-like sequences in its 5'-flanking region, one of them perfectly matching dre and the other two demonstrating a match in seven of eight nucleotides. these sequences were named dre1 (-63 to -69), dre2 (-378 to -385), and dre3 (-1127 to -1134), respectively. immunostaining of polytene chromosomes in third-instar larvae using anti-dref sera detected a specific band in 82e2 of 3r chromosome, containing the rfc1 gene region. band-mobility shift assays using drosophila kc cell nuclear extracts revealed that dref binds to dre1, -2, and -3 in vitro, and chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-dref igg confirmed that this occurs in vivo. luciferase transient expression assays in s2 cells further suggested that dres in the rfc1 promoter are involved in transcriptional regulation of the gene. moreover, rfc1 promoter activity was reduced by 38% in dref double-stranded rna-treated s2 cells. these results indicate that dref positively regulates the rfc1 promoter.

in drosophila, black cells (bc) encodes a prophenoloxidase and is expressed late in the maturation of crystal cells, which are blood cells involved in wound healing and immune encapsulation. enhancer analysis of bc revealed a 1,025-bp upstream sequence that regulates gene expression in a crystal cell exclusive pattern. expression of this fragment is altered by mutations in the gata family serpent (srp) and runx family lozenge (lz) genes; srp and lz are required for crystal cell specification. deletional analysis uncovered a 330-bp crystal cell-specific sequence, which contains two gata and three lz binding sites. mutational analysis revealed that both gata sites are necessary, but not sufficient for crystal cell expression. however, one of the lz sites is essential for crystal cell expression. thus, srp and lz do not just specify the crystal cell lineage, but also regulate the later differentiation of these cells. additionally, we now have a sensitive tool for marking crystal cells in live animals.

members of the runx and gata transcription factor families play critical roles during hematopoiesis from drosophila to mammals. in drosophila, the formation of the crystal cell hematopoietic lineage depends on the continuous expression of the lineage-specific runx factor lozenge (lz) and on its interaction with the gata factor serpent (srp). crystal cells are the main source of prophenoloxidases (propos), the enzymes required for melanization. by analyzing the promoter regions of several insect propos, we identify a conserved gata/runx cis-regulatory module that ensures the crystal cell-specific expression of the three drosophila melanogaster propo. we demonstrate that activation of this module requires the direct binding of both srp and lz. interestingly, a similar gata/runx signature is over-represented in crystal cell differentiation markers, allowing us to identify new srp/lz target genes by genome-wide screening of drosophila promoter regions. finally, we show that the expression of lz in the crystal cells also relies on srp/lz-mediated activation via a similar module, indicating that crystal cell fate choice maintenance and activation of the differentiation program are coupled. based on our observations, we propose that this gata/runx cis-regulatory module may be reiteratively used during hematopoietic development through evolution.

cardiac development proceeds via the activation of a complex network of regulatory factors which both directly and indirectly impact downstream cardiac structural genes. in drosophila, the nk homeodomain transcription factor tinman is critical to cardiac specification and development via the activation of a number of key regulatory genes which mediate heart development. in this manuscript, we demonstrate that tinman also functions in drosophila to directly activate transcription of the atp binding cassette gene sulphonylurea receptor (sur). cardiac expression of sur is regulated by tinman via an intron enhancer which first becomes active at stage 12 of embryogenesis, and whose function is restricted to the tin cardial cells by the end of embryogenesis. cardiac sur enhancer activity subsequently persists through larval and adult development, but interestingly becomes modulated in several unique subsets of tin-expressing cardial cells. the cardiac enhancer contains four binding sites for tinman protein; mutation of two of these sites significantly reduces enhancer activity at all stages of development, and activation of the wild-type enhancer by ectopic tinman protein confirms sur is a direct target of tinman transcriptional activation. these findings delineate at the molecular level specific sub-types of tin cardial cells, and define an important regulatory pathway between two drosophila genes for which mutations in human homologs have been shown to result in cardiac disease.

the regulatory sequences leading to the ovarian and fat body expression of yolk proteins 1 and 2 (yp1 and 2) of drosophila melanogaster have been characterised in some detail. these genes (yp1 and yp2) share many enhancer elements, and some important regulatory sequences lie within the coding regions. we have begun to investigate the cis-regulation of the gene encoding yolk protein 3 (yp3). we describe a system for p element transformation using the complete and unaltered yp3 gene rather than reporter genes and describe sequences conferring correct expression in the ovary and carcass.

despite its morphological similarity to the other species in the drosophila melanogaster species complex, d. sechellia has evolved distinct physiological and behavioral adaptations to its host plant morinda citrifolia, commonly known as tahitian noni. the odor of the ripe fruit of m. citrifolia originates from hexanoic and octanoic acid. d. sechellia is attracted to these two fatty acids, whereas the other species in the complex are repelled. here, using interspecies hybrids between d. melanogaster deficiency mutants and d. sechellia, we showed that the odorant-binding protein 57e (obp57e) gene is involved in the behavioral difference between the species. d. melanogaster knock-out flies for obp57e and obp57d showed altered behavioral responses to hexanoic acid and octanoic acid. furthermore, the introduction of obp57d and obp57e from d. simulans and d. sechellia shifted the oviposition site preference of d. melanogaster obp57d/e(ko) flies to that of the original species, confirming the contribution of these genes to d. sechellia's specialization to m. citrifolia. our finding of the genes involved in host-plant determination may lead to further understanding of mechanisms underlying taste perception, evolution of plant-herbivore interactions, and speciation.

the insulin receptor (inr) signaling pathway is largely conserved in metazoans and it is required for normal growth and development in drosophila. despite the importance of this pathway in regulating growth, development and metabolism in drosophila, little is known about how dinr expression is controlled in flies. here we report the characterization of the dinr gene promoter and the analysis of its expression during embryo development. drosophila inr gene has three promoters spanning 40 kb in the genome. these promoters direct the expression of three distinct mrna transcripts that share common exons downstream of the initiator codon atg but have different 5'utrs. all three promoters are differentially regulated, spatially and temporally, contributing to a very complex pattern of expression in the developing embryo. our results indicate that dinr expression in drosophila displays an intricate pattern of regulation that assures an adequate control of growth, development and metabolism.

background: the visceral trunk mesoderm in drosophila melanogaster develops under inductive signals from the ectoderm. this leads to the activation of the key regulators tinman, bagpipe and biniou that are crucial for specification of the circular visceral muscles. how further differentiation is regulated is widely unknown, therefore it seems to be essential to identify downstream target genes of the early key regulators. in our report we focus on the analysis of the transcriptional control of the highly conserved transcription factor hand in circular visceral muscle cells, providing evidence that the hand gene is a direct target of biniou. results: herein we describe the identification of a regulatory region in the hand gene essential and sufficient for the expression in the visceral mesoderm during embryogenesis. we found that hand expression in the circular visceral mesoderm is abolished in embryos mutant for the foxf domain containing transcription factor biniou. furthermore we demonstrate that biniou regulates hand expression by direct binding to a 300 bp sequence element, located within the 3rd intron of the hand gene. this regulatory element is highly conserved in different drosophila species. in addition, we provide evidence that hand is dispensable for the initial differentiation of the embryonic visceral mesoderm. conclusion: in the present report we show that cross species sequence comparison of non-coding sequences between orthologous genes is a powerful tool to identify conserved regulatory elements. combining functional dissection experiments in vivo and protein/dna binding studies we identified hand as a direct target of biniou in the circular visceral muscles.

cell fate determination is often the outcome of specific interactions between adjacent cells. however, cells frequently change positions during development, and thus signaling molecules might be synthesized far from their final site of action. here, we analyze the regulation of the torso-like gene, which is required to trigger torso receptor tyrosine kinase activation in the drosophila embryo. whereas torso is present in the oocyte, torso-like is expressed in the egg chamber, at the posterior follicle cells and in two separated groups of anterior cells, the border cells and the centripetal cells. we find that jak/stat signaling regulates torso-like expression in the posterior follicle cells and border cells but not in the centripetal cells, where torso-like is regulated by a different enhancer. the border and centripetal cells, which are originally apart, converge at the anterior end of the oocyte, and we find that both groups contribute to trigger torso activation. our results illustrate how independently acquired expression of a signaling molecule can constitute a mechanism by which distinct groups of cells act together in the activation of a signaling pathway.

one central, and yet unsolved, question in evolutionary biology is the relationship between the genetic variants segregating within species and the causes of morphological differences between species. the classic neo-darwinian view postulates that species differences result from the accumulation of small-effect changes at multiple loci. however, many examples support the possible role of larger abrupt changes in the expression of developmental genes in morphological evolution. although this evidence might be considered a challenge to a neo-darwinian micromutationist view of evolution, there are currently few examples of the actual genes causing morphological differences between species. here we examine the genetic basis of a trichome pattern difference between drosophila species, previously shown to result from the evolution of a single gene, shavenbaby (svb), probably through cis-regulatory changes. we first identified three distinct svb enhancers from d. melanogaster driving reporter gene expression in partly overlapping patterns that together recapitulate endogenous svb expression. all three homologous enhancers from d. sechellia drive expression in modified patterns, in a direction consistent with the evolved svb expression pattern. to test the influence of these enhancers on the actual phenotypic difference, we conducted interspecific genetic mapping at a resolution sufficient to recover multiple intragenic recombinants. this functional analysis revealed that independent genetic regions upstream of svb that overlap the three identified enhancers are collectively required to generate the d. sechellia trichome pattern. our results demonstrate that the accumulation of multiple small-effect changes at a single locus underlies the evolution of a morphological difference between species. these data support the view that alleles of large effect that distinguish species may sometimes reflect the accumulation of multiple mutations of small effect at select genes.

alterations in hox gene expression patterns have been implicated in both large and small-scale morphological evolution. an improved understanding of these changes requires a detailed understanding of hox gene cis-regulatory function and evolution. cis-regulatory evolution of the hox gene ultrabithorax (ubx) has been shown to contribute to evolution of trichome patterns on the posterior second femur (t2p) of drosophila species. as a step toward determining how this function of ubx has evolved, we performed a series of experiments to clarify the role of ubx in patterning femurs and to identify the cis-regulatory regions of ubx that drive expression in t2p. we first performed clonal analysis to further define ubx function in patterning bristle and trichome patterns in the legs. we found that low levels of ubx expression are sufficient to repress an eighth bristle row on the posterior second and third femurs, whereas higher levels of expression are required to promote the development and migration of other bristles on the third femur and to repress trichomes. we then tested the hypothesis that the evolutionary difference in t2p trichome patterns due to ubx was caused by a change in the global cis-regulation of ubx expression. we found no evidence to support this view, suggesting that the evolved difference in ubx function reflects evolution of a leg-specific enhancer. we then searched for the regulatory regions of the ubx locus that drive expression in the second and third femur by assaying all existing regulatory mutations of the ubx locus and new deficiencies in the large intron of ubx that we generated by p-element-induced male recombination. we found that two enhancer regions previously known to regulate ubx expression in the legs, abx and pbx, are required for ubx expression in the third femur, but that they do not contribute to pupal expression of ubx in the second femur. this analysis allowed us to rule out at least 100 kb of dna in and around the ubx locus as containing a t2p-specific enhancer. we then surveyed an additional approximately 30 kb using enhancer constructs. none of these enhancer constructs produced an expression pattern similar to ubx expression in t2p. thus, after surveying over 95% of the ubx locus, we have not been able to localize a t2p-specific enhancer. while the enhancer could reside within the small regions we have not surveyed, it is also possible that the enhancer is structurally complex and/or acts only within its native genomic context.

the drosophila dysfusion basic-helix-loop-helix-pas (bhlh-pas) protein controls the transcription of genes that mediate tracheal fusion. dysfusion is highly related to the mammalian nxf protein that has been implicated in nervous system gene regulation. toward the goal of understanding how dysfusion controls fusion cell gene expression, the biochemical properties of dysfusion were investigated using protein interaction experiments, cell culture-based transcription assays, and in vivo transgenic analyses. dysfusion dimerizes with the tango bhlh-pas protein, and together they act as a dna binding transcriptional activator. dysfusion/tango binds multiple ncgtg binding sites, with the following preference: tcgtg > gcgtg > acgtg > ccgtg. this binding site promiscuity differs from the restricted binding site preferences of other bhlh-pas/tango heterodimers. however, it is identical to the binding site preferences of mammalian nxf/arnt, indicating that the specificity is evolutionarily conserved. germ line transformation experiments using a fragment of the cg13196 dysfusion target gene allowed identification of a fusion cell enhancer. experiments in which ncgtg sites were mutated individually and in combination revealed that tcgtg sites were required for fusion cell expression but that the single acgtg and gcgtg sites present were not. finally, a reporter transgene containing four tandemly arranged tcgtg elements has strong expression in tracheal fusion cells. transgenic misexpression of dysfusion further revealed that dysfusion has the ability to activate transcription in multiple cell types, although it does this most effectively in tracheal cells and can only function at mid-embryogenesis and later.

we have determined the nucleotide sequence and structure of pgd+, the drosophila melanogaster gene that encodes the enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6pgd). the derived 481-amino acid sequence for d. melanogaster 6pgd is presented and compared with 6pgd sequences from other species. to characterize the cis-acting sequences necessary for expression of pgd+, fragments containing this gene as well as pgd+ promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into the d. melanogaster germ line by p-element-mediated transformation. our results indicate that the large second intron is critical for pgd+ expression in adults. only 421 bp of pgd+ 5'-flanking dna are necessary to direct expression in imaginal discs, gonads and gut of third-instar larvae. sequences downstream from the transcription start point are necessary for expression in the larval fat body.

the toll and imd pathways induce humoral innate immune responses in drosophila by activating nf-kappab proteins that bind kappab target sites. here, we delineate a kappab site sequence code that directs pathway-specific expression of innate immune loci. using bioinformatic analysis of expression and sequence data, we identify shared properties of imd- and toll-specific response elements. employing synthetic kappab sites in luciferase reporter and in vitro binding assays, we demonstrate that the length of the (g)(n) element in the 5' half-site and of the central (a,t)-rich region combine to specify responsiveness to one or both pathways. we also show that multiple sites function to enhance the response to either or both pathways. together, these studies elucidate the mechanism by which kappab motifs direct binding by particular drosophila nf-kappab family members and thereby induce specialized innate immune repertoires.

in this paper we analyze the expression in follicular cells and regulation of the vitelline membrane protein gene we identified in region 32e of the second chromosome of d. melanogaster (vmp32e). we report germ line transformation results obtained with different kinds of gene fusion leading to the identification of a follicular cell subpopulation involved in the expression of the vmp32e. we have characterized two 5' non-transcribed regions (-465/-249; -135/-39) where the cis-acting transcriptional regulatory sequences, directing tissue and temporal specificity, are contained. the region between -465 and -249, which appears to control transcriptional high efficiency, does not behave as an enhancer as it is incapable of conferring any expression to a reporter gene. the region between -135 and -39 can confer temporal specificity of expression of the vmp32e gene, albeit at a very low level. most interestingly, sequence similarities to ecdysone response elements raise the possibility of hormonal control also for vmp gene expression.

the drosophila gata factor serpent interacts with the runx factor lozenge to activate the crystal cell program, whereas serpentnc binds the friend of gata protein u-shaped to limit crystal cell production. here, we identified a lozenge minimal hematopoietic cis-regulatory module and showed that lozenge-lacz reporter-gene expression was autoregulated by serpent and lozenge. we also showed that upregulation of u-shaped was delayed until after lozenge activation, consistent with our previous results that showed u-shaped expression in the crystal cell lineage is dependent on both serpent and lozenge. together, these observations describe a feed forward regulatory motif, which controls the temporal expression of u-shaped. finally, we showed that lozenge reporter-gene activity increased in a u-shaped mutant background and that forced expression of serpentnc with u-shaped blocked lozenge- and u-shaped-lacz reporter-gene activity. this is the first demonstration of gata:fog regulation of runx and fog gene expression. moreover, these results identify components of a serpent cross-regulatory sub-circuit that can modulate lozenge expression. based on the sub-circuit design and the combinatorial control of crystal cell production, we present a model for the specification of a dynamic bi-potential regulatory state that contributes to the selection between a lozenge-positive and lozenge-negative state.

the dna replication-related element-binding factor (dref) regulates cell proliferation-related gene expression in drosophila. we have carried out a genetic screening, taking advantage of the rough eye phenotype of transgenic flies that express full-length dref in the eye imaginal discs and identified the eukaryotic initiation factor 4a (eif4a) gene as a dominant suppressor of the dref-induced rough eye phenotype. the eif4a gene was here found to carry three dre sequences, dre1 (-40 to -47), dre2 (-48 to -55), and dre3 (-267 to -274) in its promoter region, these all being important for the eif4a gene promoter activity in cultured drosophila kc cells and in living flies. knockdown of dref in drosophila s2 cells decreased the eif4a mrna level and the eif4a gene promoter activity. furthermore, specific binding of dref to genomic regions containing dre sequences was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-dref antibodies. band mobility shift assays using kc cell nuclear extracts revealed that dref could bind to dre1 and dre3 sequences in the eif4a gene promoter in vitro, but not to the dre2 sequence. the results suggest that the eif4a gene is under the control of the dref pathway and dref is therefore involved in the regulation of protein synthesis.

smooth muscle plays a prominent role in many fundamental processes and diseases, yet our understanding of the transcriptional network regulating its development is very limited. the foxf transcription factors are essential for visceral smooth muscle development in diverse species, although their direct regulatory role remains elusive. we present a transcriptional map of biniou (a foxf transcription factor) and bagpipe (an nkx factor) activity, as a first step to deciphering the developmental program regulating drosophila visceral muscle development. a time course of chromatin immunoprecipitatation followed by microarray analysis (chip-on-chip) experiments and expression profiling of mutant embryos reveal a dynamic map of in vivo bound enhancers and direct target genes. while biniou is broadly expressed, it regulates enhancers driving temporally and spatially restricted expression. in vivo reporter assays indicate that the timing of biniou binding is a key trigger for the time span of enhancer activity. although bagpipe and biniou mutants phenocopy each other, their regulatory potential is quite different. this network architecture was not apparent from genetic studies, and highlights biniou as a universal regulator in all visceral muscle, regardless of its developmental origin or subsequent function. the regulatory connection of a number of biniou target genes is conserved in mice, suggesting an ancient wiring of this developmental program.

eukaryotes use autophagy to turn over organelles, protein aggregates, and cytoplasmic constituents. the impairment of autophagy causes developmental defects, starvation sensitivity, the accumulation of protein aggregates, neuronal degradation, and cell death [1, 2]. double-membraned autophagosomes sequester cytoplasm and fuse with endosomes or lysosomes in higher eukaryotes [3], but the importance of the endocytic pathway for autophagy and associated disease is not known. here, we show that regulators of endosomal biogenesis and functions play a critical role in autophagy in drosophila melanogaster. genetic and ultrastructural analysis showed that subunits of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (escrt)-i, -ii and -iii, as well as their regulatory atpase vps4 and the endosomal ptdins(3)p 5-kinase fab1, all are required for autophagy. although the loss of escrt or vps4 function caused the accumulation of autophagosomes, probably because of inhibited fusion with the endolysosomal system, fab1 activity was necessary for the maturation of autolysosomes. importantly, reduced escrt functions aggravated polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity in a model for huntington's disease. thus, this study links escrt function with autophagy and aggregate-induced neurodegeneration, thereby providing a plausible explanation for the fact that escrt mutations are involved in inherited neurodegenerative disease in humans [4].

drosophila has emerged as an important model system to discover and analyze genes controlling hematopoiesis. one regulatory network known to control hemocyte differentiation is the janus kinase (jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) signal-transduction pathway. a constitutive activation mutation of the janus kinase hopscotch (hopscotch(tumorous-lethal); hop(tum-l)) results in a leukemia-like over-proliferation of hemocytes and copious differentiation of lamellocytes during larval stages. here we show that the friend of gata (fog) protein u-shaped (ush) is expressed in circulating and lymph gland hemocytes, where it plays a critical role in controlling blood cell proliferation and differentiation. our findings demonstrate that a reduction in ush function results in hematopoietic phenotypes strikingly similar to those observed in hop(tum-l) animals. these include lymph gland hypertrophy, increased circulating hemocyte concentration, and abundant production of lamellocytes. forced expression of n-terminal truncated versions of ush likewise leads to larvae with severe hematopoietic anomalies. in contrast, expression of wild-type ush results in a strong suppression of hop(tum-l) phenotypes. taken together, our findings demonstrate that u-shaped acts to control larval hemocyte proliferation and suppress lamellocyte differentiation, likely regulating hematopoietic events downstream of hop kinase activity. such functions appear to be facilitated through ush interaction with the hematopoietic gata factor serpent (srp).

the cd36 family of transmembrane receptors is present across metazoans and has been implicated biochemically in lipid binding and transport. several cd36 proteins function in the immune system as scavenger receptors for bacterial pathogens and seem to act as cofactors for toll-like receptors by facilitating recognition of bacterially derived lipids. here we show that a drosophila melanogaster cd36 homologue, sensory neuron membrane protein (snmp), is expressed in a population of olfactory sensory neurons (osns) implicated in pheromone detection. snmp is essential for the electrophysiological responses of osns expressing the receptor or67d to (z)-11-octadecenyl acetate (cis-vaccenyl acetate, cva), a volatile male-specific fatty-acid-derived pheromone that regulates sexual and social aggregation behaviours. snmp is also required for the activation of the moth pheromone receptor hr13 by its lipid-derived pheromone ligand (z)-11-hexadecenal, but is dispensable for the responses of the conventional odorant receptor or22a to its short hydrocarbon fruit ester ligands. finally, we show that snmp is required for responses of or67d to cva when ectopically expressed in osns not normally activated by pheromones. because mammalian cd36 binds fatty acids, we suggest that snmp acts in concert with odorant receptors to capture pheromone molecules on the surface of olfactory dendrites. our work identifies an unanticipated cofactor for odorant receptors that is likely to have a widespread role in insect pheromone detection. moreover, these results define a unifying model for cd36 function, coupling recognition of lipid-based extracellular ligands to signalling receptors in both pheromonal communication and pathogen recognition through the innate immune system.

the basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) protein dimmed (dimm) supports the differentiation of secretory properties in numerous peptidergic cells of drosophila melanogaster. dimm is coexpressed with diverse amidated neuropeptides and with the amidating enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (phm) in approximately 300 cells of the late embryo. here we confirm that dimm has transcription factor activity in transfected hek 293 cells and that the phm gene is a direct target. the mammalian dimm orthologue mist1 also transactivated the phm gene. dimm activity was dependent on the basic region of the protein and on the sequences of three e-box sites within phm's first intron; the sites make different contributions to the total activity. these data suggest a model whereby the three e boxes interact cooperatively and independently to produce high phm transcriptional activation. this dimm-controlled phm regulatory region displayed similar properties in vivo. spatially, its expression mirrored that of the dimm protein, and its activity was largely dependent on dimm. further, in vivo expression was highly dependent on the sequences of the same three e boxes. this study supports the hypothesis that dimm is a master regulator of a peptidergic cell fate in drosophila and provides a detailed transcriptional mechanism of dimm action on a defined target gene.

we have analyzed the molecular basis of sugar reception in drosophila. we define the response spectrum, concentration dependence, and temporal dynamics of sugar-sensing neurons. using in situ hybridization and reporter gene expression, we identify members of the gr5a-related taste receptor subfamily that are coexpressed in sugar neurons. neurons expressing reporters of different gr5a-related genes send overlapping but distinct projections to the brain and thoracic ganglia. genetic analysis of receptor genes shows that gr5a is required for response to one subset of sugars and gr64a for response to a complementary subset. a gr5a;gr64a double mutant shows no physiological or behavioral responses to any tested sugar. the simplest interpretation of our results is that gr5a and gr64a are each capable of functioning independently of each other within individual sugar neurons and that they are the primary receptors used in the labellum to detect sugars.

specification of muscle identity in drosophila is a multistep process: early positional information defines competence groups termed promuscular clusters, from which muscle progenitors are selected, followed by asymmetric division of progenitors into muscle founder cells (fcs). each fc seeds the formation of an individual muscle with morphological and functional properties that have been proposed to reflect the combination of transcription factors expressed by its founder. however, it is still unclear how early patterning and muscle-specific differentiation are linked. we addressed this question, using collier (col; also known as knot) expression as both a determinant and read-out of da3 muscle identity. characterization of the col upstream region driving da3 muscle specific expression revealed the existence of three separate phases of cis-regulation, correlating with conserved binding sites for different mesodermal transcription factors. examination of col transcription in col and nautilus (nau) loss-of-function and gain-of-function conditions showed that both factors are required for col activation in the ;naïve' myoblasts that fuse with the da3 fc, thereby ensuring that all da3 myofibre nuclei express the same identity programme. together, these results indicate that separate sets of cis-regulatory elements control the expression of identity factors in muscle progenitors and myofibre nuclei and directly support the concept of combinatorial control of muscle identity.

members of the drosophila gustatory receptor (gr) gene family are generally expressed in chemosensory neurons and are known to mediate the perception of sugars, bitter substrates, co(2), and pheromones. the gr gene family consists of 68 members, many of which are organized in gene clusters of up to six genes, yet only expression of about 15 gr genes has been characterized in detail prior to this study. here we describe the first comprehensive expression analysis of six highly conserved gr genes, gr28a and gr28b.a to gr28b.e. four of these gr genes are not only expressed in the characteristic pattern associated with previously analyzed gr genes-chemosensory neurons of the gustatory and olfactory system-but several other types of sensory neurons and neurons in the brain. specifically, we show that several of the gr28 genes are expressed in abdominal multidendritic neurons, putative hygroreceptive neurons of the arista, neurons associated with the johnston's organ, peripheral proprioceptive neurons in the legs, neurons in the larval and adult brain, and oenocytes. thus, our findings suggest that some gr genes are utilized in nongustatory roles in the nervous system and tissues involved in proprioception, hygroreception, and other sensory modalities. it is also possible that the gr28 genes have chemosensory roles in the detection of internal ligands.

the determination of neuronal identity in drosophila cells depends on the accurate expression of proneural genes. the proneural gene atonal (ato) encodes a basic-hlh protein required for photoreceptor and chordotonal organ formation. the initial expression of ato in imaginal discs is regulated by sequences that lie 3' to its open reading frame. in this report, we show that the initial ato transcription in different imaginal discs is regulated by distinct 3' cis-regulatory sequences. the eye-specific ato 3' cis-regulatory sequence consists of two distinct elements we term 2.8 pb and 3.6 bp that regulate ato transcription during different stages of eye development. the 2.8 pb enhancer contains a highly conserved consensus binding site for the retinal determination (rd) factor sine oculis (so). mutation of this so binding site abolishes 2.8 pb enhancer activity. furthermore the rd factors so and eyes absent (eya) are required for 2.8 pb enhancer activity and can induce ectopic 2.8 pb reporter expression. in contrast, ectopic dpp signaling is not sufficient to induce ato 3' enhancer activation but can induce increased levels of rd factor dachshund (dac) and synergize with so and eya to increase ato 3' enhancer activity. these results demonstrate a direct mechanism by which the rd factors regulate ato expression and suggest an important role of dpp in the activation of ato 3' enhancer is to regulate the levels of rd factors.

the drosophila activin-like ligands activin-beta and dawdle control several aspects of neuronal morphogenesis, including mushroom body remodeling, dorsal neuron morphogenesis and motoneuron axon guidance. here we show that the same two ligands act redundantly through the activin receptor babo and its transcriptional mediator smad2 (smox), to regulate neuroblast numbers and proliferation rates in the developing larval brain. blocking this pathway results in the development of larvae with small brains and aberrant photoreceptor axon targeting, and restoring babo function in neuroblasts rescued these mutant phenotypes. these results suggest that the activin signaling pathway is required for producing the proper number of neurons to enable normal connection of incoming photoreceptor axons to their targets. furthermore, as the activin pathway plays a key role in regulating propagation of mouse and human embryonic stem cells, our observation that it also regulates neuroblast numbers and proliferation in drosophila suggests that involvement of activins in controlling stem cell propagation may be a common regulatory feature of this family of tgf-beta-type ligands.

although most invertebrate neuropeptide-encoding genes display distinct expression patterns in the central nervous system (cns), the molecular mechanisms underlying spatial regulation of the neuropeptide genes are largely unknown. expression of the neuropeptide corazonin (crz) is limited to only 24 neurons in the larval cns of drosophila melanogaster, and these neurons have been categorized into three groups, namely, dl, dm, and vcrz. to identify cis-regulatory elements that control transcription of crz in each neuronal group, reporter gene expression patterns driven by various 5' flanking sequences of crz were analyzed to assess their promoter activities in the cns. we show that the 504-bp 5' upstream sequence is the shortest promoter directing reporter activities in all crz neurons. further dissection of this sequence revealed two important regions responsible for group specificity: -504::-419 for dm expression and -380::-241 for dl and vcrz expression. the latter region is further subdivided into three sites (proximal, center, and distal), in which any combinations of the two are sufficient for dl expression, whereas both proximal and distal sites are required for vcrz expression. interestingly, the tata box does not play a role in crz transcription in most neurons. we also show that a 434-bp 5' upstream sequence of the d. virilis crz gene, when introduced into the d. melanogaster genome, drives reporter expression in the dl and vcrz neurons, suggesting that regulatory mechanisms for crz expression in at least two such neuronal groups are conserved between the two species.

dorsal closure is a paradigm epithelial fusion episode that occurs late in drosophila embryogenesis and leads to sealing of a midline hole by bonding of two opposing epithelial sheets. the leading edge epithelial cells express filopodia and fusion is dependent on interdigitation of these filopodia to prime formation of adhesions. since the opposing epithelia are molecularly patterned there must exist some mechanism for accurately aligning the two sheets across this fusion seam. to address this, we generated a fly in which rfp-moesin and gfp-moesin are expressed in mutually exclusive stripes within each segment using the engrailed and patched promoters. we observe mutually exclusive interactions between the filopodia of engrailed and patched cells. interactions between filopodia from matching cells leads to formation of tethers between them, and these tethers can pull misaligned epithelial sheets into alignment. filopodial matching also occurs during repair of laser wounds in the ventral epithelium, and so this behaviour is not restricted to leading edge cells during dorsal closure. finally, we characterise the behaviour of a patched-expressing cell that we observe within the engrailed region of segments a1-a5, and provide evidence that this cell contributes to cell matching.

"the development of the drosophila leg requires both decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg), two signals that establish the proximo-distal (pd) axis by activating target genes such as distalless (dll). dll expression in the leg depends on a dpp- and wg-dependent phase and a maintenance phase that is independent of these signals. here, we show that accurate dll expression in the leg results from the synergistic interaction between two cis-regulatory elements. the leg trigger (lt) element directly integrates wg and dpp inputs and is only active in cells receiving high levels of both signals. the maintenance (m) element is able to maintain wg- and dpp-independent expression, but only when in cis to lt. m, which includes the native dll promoter, functions as an autoregulatory element by directly binding dll. the ""trigger-maintenance"" model describes a mechanism by which secreted morphogens act combinatorially to induce the stable expression of target genes."

the cut locus is a complex gene whose function is necessary for specification of a number of cell types, including the external sensory organs. the cut wing class of mutations of the cut locus are homozygous viable and lack tissue from the wing margin, which is normally composed of external sensory organs and noninnervated bristles. expression of cut was examined in the developing wings of wild-type and mutant pupae using an antiserum against cut protein. cut is expressed in all of the external sensory organs of the wing and the noninnervated bristles of the posterior margin. the cut wing class of mutations prevents cut expression specifically in the wing margin mechanoreceptors and noninnervated bristles, apparently preventing neural differentiation. the transformed cells die soon after differentiation would have occurred. we identify an enhancer, located about 80 kb upstream of the cut gene promoter, that confers expression in the cells of the mechanoreceptors and noninnervated bristles from a heterologous promoter. the 27 gypsy retrotransposon insertions that prevent expression in these margin cells, all occur between this enhancer and the promoter. these gypsy insertions probably interfere with the interaction between the enhancer and the cut gene promoter.

insulin resistance is a major feature of pathological states such as obesity and diabetes. a consequence of insulin resistance is enhanced lipolysis, which causes excessive release of free fatty acids and deregulates fatty acid homeostasis. the transcription factor foxo1 has a central role in the regulation of glucose levels by insulin: reduced insulin signaling causes foxo1 activation, which increases hepatic glucose production by activating transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase mrnas. our results suggest an additional role for foxo transcription factors: the regulation of lipid homeostasis by insulin. here, we show that in flies, dfoxo regulates lipase 4 (dlip4), a drosophila homologue of human acid lipases. dfoxo binds and activates the dlip4 promoter, in vitro and in vivo, and regulates dlip4 expression. in addition, dlip4 mrna expression in flies is dependent on dfoxo. our results support a model where dfoxo acts as a key modulator of lipid metabolism by insulin signaling and integrates insulin responses to glucose and lipid homeostasis.

functional complexity of the central nervous system (cns) is reflected by the large number and diversity of genes expressed in its many different cell types. understanding the control of gene expression within cells of the cns will help reveal how various neurons and glia develop and function. midline cells of drosophila differentiate into glial cells and several types of neurons and also serve as a signaling center for surrounding tissues. here, we examine regulation of the midline gene, wrapper, required for both neuron-glia interactions and viability of midline glia. we identify a region upstream of wrapper required for midline expression that is highly conserved (87%) between 12 drosophila species. site-directed mutagenesis identifies four motifs necessary for midline glial expression: (1) a single-minded/tango binding site, (2) a motif resembling a pointed binding site, (3) a motif resembling a sox binding site, and (4) a novel motif. an additional highly conserved 27 bp are required to restrict expression to midline glia and exclude it from midline neurons. these results suggest short, highly conserved genomic sequences flanking drosophila midline genes are indicative of functional regulatory regions and that small changes within these sequences can alter the expression pattern of a gene.

age-associated changes in stem cell populations have been implicated in age-related diseases, including cancer. however, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms that link aging to the modulation of adult stem cell populations. drosophila midgut is an excellent model system for the study of stem cell renewal and aging. here we describe an age-related increase in the number and activity of intestinal stem cells (iscs) and progenitor cells in drosophila midgut. we determined that oxidative stress, induced by paraquat treatment or loss of catalase function, mimicked the changes associated with aging in the midgut. furthermore, we discovered an age-related increase in the expression of pvf2, a drosophila homologue of human pdgf/vegf, which was associated with and required for the age-related changes in midgut iscs and progenitor cell populations. taken together, our findings suggest that pdgf/vegf may play a central role in age-related changes in iscs and progenitor cell populations, which may contribute to aging and the development of cancer stem cells.

carbon dioxide (co2) elicits different olfactory behaviors across species. in drosophila, neurons that detect co2 are located in the antenna, form connections in a ventral glomerulus in the antennal lobe, and mediate avoidance. by contrast, in the mosquito these neurons are in the maxillary palps (mps), connect to medial sites, and promote attraction. we found in drosophila that loss of a microrna, mir-279, leads to formation of co2 neurons in the mps. mir-279 acts through down-regulation of the transcription factor nerfin-1. the ectopic neurons are hybrid cells. they express co2 receptors and form connections characteristic of co2 neurons, while exhibiting wiring and receptor characteristics of mp olfactory receptor neurons (orns). we propose that this hybrid orn reveals a cellular intermediate in the evolution of species-specific behaviors elicited by co2.

copper homeostasis is achieved by a combination of regulated uptake, efflux and sequestration and is essential for animal health and viability. transmembrane copper transport proteins of the p-type atpase family play key roles in cellular copper efflux. here, the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of dmatp7, the sole drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the human mnk and wnd copper transport genes, is examined. an enhancer element with sufficient regulatory information to rescue dmatp7 mutant flies to adulthood is identified. this regulatory element drives expression in all neuronal tissues examined and demonstrates copper-inducible, mtf-1 dependent expression in the larval midgut. these results support an important functional role for copper transport in neuronal tissues and indicate that regulation of dmatp7 expression is not used to limit copper absorption in toxic copper conditions. localisation of a functional eyfp-dmatp7 fusion protein is also examined. this fusion protein localises at or proximal to the basolateral membrane of dmatp7 expressing midgut cells supporting a role for dmatp7 in export of copper from midgut cells.

understanding the mechanisms underlying the morphological divergence of species is one of the central goals of evolutionary biology. here, we analyze the genetic and molecular bases of the divergence of body pigmentation patterns between drosophila yakuba and its sister species drosophila santomea. we found that loss of pigmentation in d. santomea involved the selective loss of expression of the tan and yellow pigmentation genes. we demonstrate that tan gene expression was eliminated through the mutational inactivation of one specific tan cis-regulatory element (cre) whereas the tan protein sequence remained unchanged. surprisingly, we identify three independent loss-of-function alleles of the tan cre in the young d. santomea lineage. we submit that there is sufficient empirical evidence to support the general prediction that functional evolutionary changes at pleiotropic loci will most often involve mutations in their discrete, modular cis-regulatory elements.

gene duplication by retrotransposition duplicates only the coding and untranslated regions of a gene and, thus, biases retroduplicated genes toward having different expression patterns from their parental genes. as such, genes duplicated by retrotransposition are more likely to develop novel expression domains. to explore this idea further, we used the prat/prat2 gene duplication in drosophila as a case study to examine the aftermath of a retrotransposition event that resulted in both the parent and the child gene becoming essential for survival. we used the gal4-uas transgene system with egfp as a reporter to determine the developmental expression patterns of prat and prat2 from d. melanogaster (dmprat and dmprat2) and prat from d. virilis (dvprat). we also tested the functional equivalence of the protein products of dmprat and dmprat2. we found that each of the proteins could rescue dmprat mutations, showing that the requirement for both prat and prat2 in drosophila is not simply due to differences in protein function. in contrast, we found that the dmprat and dmprat2 genes have developed nonoverlapping patterns of expression, which correlate with their respective loss-of-function phenotypes. we further found that dvprat expression is similar to dmprat during development but differs in adult gonads. thus, the function of the prat retrogene has not diverged in the d. melanogaster and d. virilis lineages, while some aspects of its expression pattern have evolved. finally, we have identified promoter elements, conserved upstream of dmprat and dvprat, that this retrogene has acquired to drive its expression.

cytochrome p450 monooxygenases or cyps, a family of endobiotics and xenobiotics metabolizing enzymes, are found in all organisms. we reported earlier that the promoters of drosophila cyp6a2 and cyp6a8 genes are induced by caffeine. since caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptor (ador) and inhibits camp phosphodiesterase (pde), we used luciferase reporter gene to examine whether in sl-2 cells and adult drosophila, induction of the two cyp6 genes is mediated via ador and/or pde pathway. results showed that ador is not involved because ador agonists or antagonists do not affect the cyp6 promoter activities. however, inhibition of pde by specific inhibitors including caffeine causes induction of both cyp6 gene promoters. we also found that flies mutant for dunce gene coding for camp-pde, have higher cyp6a8 promoter activity than the wild-type flies. we demonstrate that caffeine treatment increases intracellular camp levels, and camp treatment induces the cyp6 gene promoters. since both cyp6 genes have multiple sites for jun transcription factors, which generally play a positive role in camp pathway, effect of drosophila jun (d-jun) on the cyp6a8 promoter activity was examined. results showed that the expression of d-jun sense plasmid causes downregulation rather than activation of the cyp6a8 promoter. conversely, expression of antisense plasmid increased the promoter activity. interestingly, caffeine treatment decreased the d-jun protein level in sl-2 cells as well as in adult flies. these results suggest that d-jun acts as a negative regulator, and caffeine induction of cyp6a8 and cyp6a2 genes is mediated by the upregulation of camp pathway and downregulation of the d-jun protein level.

both transcriptional activation and repression have essential functions in maintaining proper spatial and temporal control of gene expression. although wnt signalling is often associated with gene activation, we have identified several directly repressed targets of wnt signalling in drosophila. here, we explore how individual wnt target genes are specified for signal-induced activation or repression. similar to activation, repression required binding of armadillo (arm) to the n terminus of tcf. however, tcf/arm mediated repression by binding to dna motifs that are markedly different from typical tcf-binding sites. conversion of the novel motifs to standard tcf-binding sites reversed the mode of regulation, resulting in wnt-mediated activation instead of repression. a mutant form of arm defective in activation was still functional for repression, indicating that distinct domains of the protein are required for each activity. this study suggests that the sequence of tcf-binding sites allosterically regulates the tcf/arm complex to effect either transcriptional activation or repression.

the drosophila mats gene plays a critical role in growth control. using molecular genetic approaches we investigated how mats is regulated in development. a 2236-bp genomic sequence that contains entire mats including upstream and downstream intergenic regions can rescue mats mutant phenotypes, indicating that regulatory elements necessary for proper mats expression are mostly retained. however, constructs without the upstream or downstream intergenic region failed to rescue mats mutants, demonstrating the functional importance of these sequences. moreover, mats expression is reduced in mats(e17), a mats allele with over one-third of the downstream intergenic region deleted. consistent with a model that the downstream intergenic region is critical for mats activity, this sequence contains evolutionarily conserved elements and has enhancer activities.

"a complex array of activator and repressor elements located within 669 bp proximal to the fushi tarazu (ftz) transcriptional start site is sufficient to generate the ""zebra-stripe"" expression pattern characteristic of the ftz gene. p-element-mediated transformation and ftz promoter/lacz fusion genes were used to characterize, in detail, several of these transcriptional control elements. by reconstructing promoters with synthetic oligonucleotides containing cis-regulators of stripe expression, we show that these regulatory sites can function as independent units to direct position-specific transcription in the drosophila embryo. in particular, we demonstrate that multiple copies of a positive regulatory site can mediate expression in both the odd- and even-numbered parasegments throughout most of the germ band and that negative regulatory sites can transform a continuous pattern of gene expression into discrete stripes. the reconstructed promoter system presented provides an effective means of studying molecular mechanisms governing spatially restricted transcription in the early embryo."

animals from flies to humans are able to distinguish subtle gradations in temperature and show strong temperature preferences. animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. here we identify a small set of warmth-activated anterior cell (ac) neurons located in the drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. ac neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dtrpa1, an ion channel that functions as a molecular sensor of warmth. flies that selectively express dtrpa1 in the ac neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dtrpa1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. this internal warmth-sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. this provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival.

nuclear pore complexes (npcs) are multisubunit protein entities embedded into the nuclear envelope (ne). here, we examine the in vivo dynamics of the essential drosophila nucleoporin nup107 and several other ne-associated proteins during ne and npcs disassembly and reassembly that take place within each mitosis. during both the rapid mitosis of syncytial embryos and the more conventional mitosis of larval neuroblasts, nup107 is gradually released from the ne, but it remains partially confined to the nuclear (spindle) region up to late prometaphase, in contrast to nucleoporins detected by wheat germ agglutinin and lamins. we provide evidence that in all drosophila cells, a structure derived from the ne persists throughout metaphase and early anaphase. finally, we examined the dynamics of the spindle checkpoint proteins mad2 and mad1. during mitotic exit, mad2 and mad1 are actively imported back from the cytoplasm into the nucleus after the ne and npcs have reformed, but they reassociate with the ne only later in g1, concomitantly with the recruitment of the basket nucleoporin mtor (the drosophila orthologue of vertebrate tpr). surprisingly, drosophila nup107 shows no evidence of localization to kinetochores, despite the demonstrated importance of this association in mammalian cells.

signaling pathways usually activate transcriptional targets in a cell type-specific manner. notable exceptions are pathway-specific feedback antagonists, which serve to restrict the range or duration of the signal. these factors are often activated by their respective pathways in a broad array of cell types. for example, the wnt ligand wingless (wg) activates the naked cuticle (nkd) gene in all tissues examined throughout drosophila development. how does the nkd gene respond in such an unrestricted manner to wg signaling? analysis in cell culture revealed regions of the nkd locus that contain wg response elements (wres) that are directly activated by the pathway via the transcription factor tcf. in flies, wg signaling activates these wres in multiple tissues, in distinct but overlapping patterns. these wres are necessary and largely sufficient for nkd expression in late stage larval tissues, but only contribute to part of the embryonic expression pattern of nkd. these results demonstrate that nkd responsiveness to wg signaling is achieved by several wres which are broadly (but not universally) activated by the pathway. the existence of several wres in the nkd locus may have been necessary to allow the wg signaling-nkd feedback circuit to remain intact as wg expression diversified during animal evolution.

the ability of adult stem cells to maintain their undifferentiated state depends upon residence in their niche. while simple models of a single self-renewal signal are attractive, niche-stem cell interactions are likely to be more complex. many niches have multiple cell types, and the drosophila testis is one such complex niche with two stem cell types, germline stem cells (gscs) and somatic cyst progenitor cells (cpcs). these stem cells require chemokine activation of jak/stat signaling for self-renewal. we identified the transcriptional repressor zfh-1 as a presumptive somatic target of jak/stat signaling, demonstrating that it is necessary and sufficient to maintain cpcs. surprisingly, sustained zfh-1 expression or intrinsic stat activation in somatic cells caused neighboring germ cells to self-renew outside their niche. in contrast, germline-intrinsic stat activation was insufficient for gsc renewal. these data reveal unexpected complexity in cell interactions in the niche, implicating cpcs in gsc self-renewal.

cell proliferation and cell type specification are coordinately regulated during normal development. cyclin e, a key g1/s cell cycle regulator, is regulated by multiple tissue-specific enhancers resulting in dynamic expression during drosophila development. here, we further characterized the enhancer that regulates cyclin e expression in the developing peripheral nervous system (pns) and show that multiple sequence elements are required for the full cyclin e pns enhancer activity. we further show that wg signaling is important for the expression of cyclin e in the sensory organ precursor (sop) cells through two conserved tcf binding sites. blocking wg signaling does not completely block sop cell formation but does completely block sop cell proliferation as well as the subsequent differentiation.

we demonstrate the feasibility of generating thousands of transgenic drosophila melanogaster lines in which the expression of an exogenous gene is reproducibly directed to distinct small subsets of cells in the adult brain. we expect the expression patterns produced by the collection of 5,000 lines that we are currently generating to encompass all neurons in the brain in a variety of intersecting patterns. overlapping 3-kb dna fragments from the flanking noncoding and intronic regions of genes thought to have patterned expression in the adult brain were inserted into a defined genomic location by site-specific recombination. these fragments were then assayed for their ability to function as transcriptional enhancers in conjunction with a synthetic core promoter designed to work with a wide variety of enhancer types. an analysis of 44 fragments from four genes found that >80% drive expression patterns in the brain; the observed patterns were, on average, comprised of <100 cells. our results suggest that the d. melanogaster genome contains >50,000 enhancers and that multiple enhancers drive distinct subsets of expression of a gene in each tissue and developmental stage. we expect that these lines will be valuable tools for neuroanatomy as well as for the elucidation of neuronal circuits and information flow in the fly brain.

the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) family of transcription factors plays key roles in the activation of muscle structural genes. in drosophila, mef2 accumulates at high levels in the embryonic muscles, where it activates target genes throughout the mesoderm. here, we identify the transglutaminase gene (tg; cg7356) as a direct transcriptional target of mef2 in the cardiac musculature. tg is expressed in cells forming the inflow tracts of the dorsal vessel, and we identify the enhancer responsible for this expression. the enhancer contains three binding sites for mef2, and can be activated by mef2 in tissue culture and in vivo. moreover, loss of mef2 function, or removal of the mef2 binding sites from the enhancer, results in loss of tg expression. these studies identify a new mef2 target in the cardiac musculature. these studies provide a possible mechanism for the activation of transglutaminase genes.

"histamine (ha) is the photoreceptor neurotransmitter in arthropods, directly gating chloride channels on large monopolar cells (lmcs), postsynaptic to photoreceptors in the lamina. two histamine-gated channel genes that could contribute to this channel in drosophila are hcla (also known as ort) and hclb (also known as hiscl1), both encoding novel members of the cys-loop receptor superfamily. drosophila s2 cells transfected with these genes expressed both homomeric and heteromeric histamine-gated chloride channels. the electrophysiological properties of these channels were compared with those from isolated drosophila lmcs. hcla homomers had nearly identical ha sensitivity to the native receptors (ec(50) = 25 microm). single-channel analysis revealed further close similarity in terms of single-channel kinetics and subconductance states ( approximately 25, 40, and 60 ps, the latter strongly voltage dependent). in contrast, hclb homomers and heteromeric receptors were more sensitive to ha (ec(50) = 14 and 1.2 microm, respectively), with much smaller single-channel conductances ( approximately 4 ps). null mutations of hcla (ort(us6096)) abolished the synaptic transients in the electroretinograms (ergs). surprisingly, the erg ""on"" transients in hclb mutants transients were approximately twofold enhanced, whereas intracellular recordings from their lmcs revealed altered responses with slower kinetics. however, hclb expression within the lamina, assessed by both a gfp (green fluorescent protein) reporter gene strategy and mrna tagging, was exclusively localized to the glia cells, whereas hcla expression was confirmed in the lmcs. our results suggest that the native receptor at the lmc synapse is an hcla homomer, whereas hclb signaling via the lamina glia plays a previously unrecognized role in shaping the lmc postsynaptic response."

the pax gene eyg is important for drosophila eye development. eyg expression in the visual system changes dynamically during development. in this study, we found that the transcriptional regulation of eyg can be separated into four distinct temporal phases (e, l1, l2, and l3) and each is regulated by distinct cis-regulatory elements. utilizing these enhancers for temporal and spatially specific manipulations, we addressed the regulation and function of eyg at different developmental stages. we found that notch signaling is required and sufficient for eyg expression and this activity is restricted only to the l2 stage. we further showed that the function of eyg in eye development is required only at the second instar larval stage, while its function for head and antenna development can be provided at any time during embryo and larval development. thus there is a temporal switch of the regulatory mechanism and function of eyg. we propose that eyg expression at l2 is induced and maintained by n signaling, and is turned off at l3 by a negative feedback loop involving the morphogenetic furrow.

importin-beta, encoded by the ketel gene in drosophila, is a key component of nuclear protein import, the formation of the spindle microtubules and the assembly of the nuclear envelope. the drosophila embryos rely on the maternal importin-beta dowry at the beginning of their life. expression of the zygotic ketel gene commences during gastrulation in every cell and while the expression is maintained in the mitotically active diploid cells it ceases in the non-dividing larval cells in which nuclear protein import is assured by the long persisting importin-beta molecules. how is the expression of the ketel gene regulated? in silico analysis revealed several conserved transcription factor binding sequences in the ketel gene promoter. reporter genes in which different segments of the promoter ensured transient expression of the luciferase gene in s2 cells identified the sequences required for normal ketel gene expression level. gel retardation and band shift assays revealed that the dref and the cfdd transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of ketel gene expression. transgenic lacz reporter genes revealed the sequences that ensure tissue-specific gene expression. apparently, the regulation of ketel gene expression depends largely on a dre motif and action of the dref, cfdd, cf2-ii and beaf transcription factors.

early sensory processing can play a critical role in sensing environmental cues. we have investigated the physiological and behavioral function of gain control at the first synapse of olfactory processing in drosophila. olfactory receptor neurons (orns) express the gaba(b) receptor (gaba(b)r), and its expression expands the dynamic range of orn synaptic transmission that is preserved in projection neuron responses. strikingly, each orn channel has a unique baseline level of gaba(b)r expression. orns that sense the aversive odorant co(2) do not express gaba(b)rs and do not have significant presynaptic inhibition. in contrast, pheromone-sensing orns express a high level of gaba(b)rs and exhibit strong presynaptic inhibition. furthermore, pheromone-dependent mate localization is impaired in flies that lack gaba(b)rs in specific orns. these findings indicate that different olfactory receptor channels employ heterogeneous presynaptic gain control as a mechanism to allow an animal's innate behavioral responses to match its ecological needs.

background: the presence of highly conserved sequences within cis-regulatory regions can serve as a valuable starting point for elucidating the basis of enhancer function. this study focuses on regulation of gene expression during the early events of drosophila neural development. we describe the use of evoprinter and cis-decoder, a suite of interrelated phylogenetic footprinting and alignment programs, to characterize highly conserved sequences that are shared among co-regulating enhancers. results: analysis of in vivo characterized enhancers that drive neural precursor gene expression has revealed that they contain clusters of highly conserved sequence blocks (csbs) made up of shorter shared sequence elements which are present in different combinations and orientations within the different co-regulating enhancers; these elements contain either known consensus transcription factor binding sites or consist of novel sequences that have not been functionally characterized. the csbs of co-regulated enhancers share a large number of sequence elements, suggesting that a diverse repertoire of transcription factors may interact in a highly combinatorial fashion to coordinately regulate gene expression. we have used information gained from our comparative analysis to discover an enhancer that directs expression of the nervy gene in neural precursor cells of the cns and pns. conclusion: the combined use evoprinter and cis-decoder has yielded important insights into the combinatorial appearance of fundamental sequence elements required for neural enhancer function. each of the 30 enhancers examined conformed to a pattern of highly conserved blocks of sequences containing shared constituent elements. these data establish a basis for further analysis and understanding of neural enhancer function.

hox factors are key regulators of distinct cells, tissues, and organs along the body plan. however, little is known about how hox factors regulate cell-specific gene expression to pattern diverse tissues. here, we show an unexpected hox transcriptional mechanism: the permissive regulation of egf secretion, and thereby cell specification, by antagonizing the senseless transcription factor in the peripheral nervous system. rhomboid expression in a subset of sensory cells stimulates egf secretion to induce hepatocyte-like cell development. we identified a rhomboid enhancer that is active in these cells and show that an abdominal hox complex directly competes with senseless for enhancer binding, with the transcriptional outcome dependent upon their relative binding activities. thus, hox-senseless antagonism forms a molecular switch that integrates neural and anterior-posterior positional information. as the vertebrate senseless homolog is essential for neural development as well as hematopoiesis, we propose hox-senseless antagonism will broadly control cell fate decisions.

sexually dimorphic traits play key roles in animal evolution and behavior. little is known, however, about the mechanisms governing their development and evolution. one recently evolved dimorphic trait is the male-specific abdominal pigmentation of drosophila melanogaster, which is repressed in females by the bric-à-brac (bab) proteins. to understand the regulation and origin of this trait, we have identified and traced the evolution of the genetic switch controlling dimorphic bab expression. we show that the hox protein abdominal-b (abd-b) and the sex-specific isoforms of doublesex (dsx) directly regulate a bab cis-regulatory element (cre). in females, abd-b and dsx(f) activate bab expression whereas in males dsx(m) directly represses bab, which allows for pigmentation. a new domain of dimorphic bab expression evolved through multiple fine-scale changes within this cre, whose ancestral role was to regulate other dimorphic features. these findings reveal how new dimorphic characters can emerge from genetic networks regulating pre-existing dimorphic traits.

drosophila big brain (bib) encodes for a protein similar to members of the major intrinsic protein family, which includes the water- and ion-conducting aquaporin (aqp) channels. in mammals, aqp dysregulation has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including colorectal cancer and colonic injury. however, the regulatory mechanisms of aqp expression remain to be clearly elucidated. in this study, as we found a dref binding site (dre) in the 5'-flanking regions of both the drosophila bib gene and the human aqp1 gene, we assessed the role of dref in bib gene expression. dref in drosophila and humans has been demonstrated to function as a key transcriptional activator for cell proliferation-related genes. herein, we demonstrate that the dre is required for optimal promoter activity of drosophila bib gene, particularly in the larval imaginal discs, which are actively proliferating tissues, as well as the adult hindgut. our results may provide insight into the mechanisms inherent to the regulation of mammalian aqp genes.

in vertebrates, seven signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) proteins bind to palindromic sites separated by spacers of two or three nucleotides (stat1), four nucleotides (stat6) or three nucleotides (stat2 to stat5a/b). this diversity of binding sites provides specificity to counter semiredundancy and was thought to be a recent evolutionary acquisition. here, we examine the natural dna-binding sites of the single drosophila stat and show that this is not the case. rather, drosophila stat92e is able to bind to and activate target gene expression through both 3n and 4n spaced sites. our experiments indicate that stat92e has a higher binding affinity for 3n sites than for 4n sites and suggest that the levels of target gene expression can be modulated by insertion and/or deletion of single bases. our results indicate that the ancestral stat protein had the capacity to bind to 3n and 4n sites and that specific stat binding preferences evolved with the radiation of the vertebrate stat family.

the elucidation of principles governing evolution of gene regulatory sequence is critical to the study of metazoan diversification. we are therefore exploring the structure and organizational constraints of regulatory sequences by studying functionally equivalent cis-regulatory modules (crms) that have been evolving in parallel across several loci. such an independent dataset allows a multi-locus study that is not hampered by nonfunctional or constrained homology. the neurogenic ectoderm enhancers (nees) of drosophila melanogaster are one such class of coordinately regulated crms. the nees share a common organization of binding sites and as a set would be useful to study the relationship between crm organization and crm activity across evolving lineages. we used the d. melanogaster transgenic system to screen for functional adaptations in the nees from divergent drosophilid species. we show that the individual nee modules across a genome in any one lineage have independently evolved adaptations to compensate for lineage-specific developmental and/or genomic changes. specifically, we show that both the site composition and the site organization of nees have been finely tuned by distinct, lineage-specific selection pressures in each of the three divergent species that we have examined: d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura, and d. virilis. furthermore, by precisely altering the organization of nees with different morphogen gradient threshold readouts, we show that crm organizational evolution is sufficient for explaining changes in enhancer activity. thus, evolution can act on crm organization to fine-tune morphogen gradient threshold readouts over a wide dynamic range. our study demonstrates that equivalence classes of crms are powerful tools for detecting lineage-specific adaptations by gene regulatory sequences.

patterning of sensory organs requires precise regulation of neural induction and repression. the neurocrystalline pattern of the adult drosophila compound eye is generated by ordered selection of single founder photoreceptors (r8s) for each unit eye or ommatidium. r8 selection requires mechanisms that restrict r8 potential to a single cell from within a group of cells expressing the proneural gene atonal (ato). one model of r8 selection suggests that r8 precursors are selected from a three-cell ;r8 equivalence group' through repression of ato by the homeodomain transcription factor rough (ro). a second model proposes that lateral inhibition is sufficient to select a single r8 from an equipotent group of cells called the intermediate group (ig). here, we provide new evidence that lateral inhibition, but not ro, is required for the initial selection of a single r8 precursor. we show that in ro mutants, ectopic r8s develop from r2,5 photoreceptor precursors independently of ectopic ato and hours after normal r8s are specified. we also show that ro directly represses the r8 specific zinc-finger transcription factor senseless (sens) in the developing r2,5 precursors to block ectopic r8 differentiation. our results support a new model for r8 selection in which lateral inhibition establishes a transient pattern of selected r8s that is permanently reinforced by a repressive bistable loop between sens and ro. this model provides new insight into the strategies that allow successful integration of a repressive patterning signal, such as lateral inhibition, with continued developmental plasticity during retinal differentiation.

fragile x syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation caused by loss of the fragile x mental retardation protein 1 (fmrp). the detailed molecular pathways underlying the pathogenesis of this disorder remain incompletely understood. here, we show that mir-124a, a nervous-system-specific mirna, is associated with the drosophila homolog of fmrp (dfmr1) in vivo. ectopic expression of wild-type but not mutant mir-124a precursors decreased dendritic branching of dendritic arborization sensory neurons, which was partially rescued by the loss of dfmr1 activity, suggesting that the biogenesis and/or function of mir-124a are partially dependent on dfmr1. indeed, in contrast with the complete loss of mature mir-124a in dicer-1 mutants, steady-state levels of endogenous or ectopically expressed mature mir-124a were partially reduced in dfmr1 mutants, whereas the level of pre-mir-124a increased. this effect could be explained in part by the reduced abundance of the dicer-1-ago1 complex in the absence of dfmr1. these findings suggest a modulatory role for dfmr1 to maintain proper levels of mirnas during neuronal development.

the achaete (ac) and scute (sc) genes of drosophila allow cells to become sensory organ mother cells. although ac and sc have similar patterns of expression, deletion of either gene removes specific subsets of sensory organs. this specificity was shown to reside in the peculiar regulation of ac and sc expression. these genes are first activated in complementary spatial domains in response to different cis-regulatory sequences. each gene product then stimulates expression of the other gene, thus generating similar patterns of expression. therefore, removal of one gene leads to the absence of both proneural gene products and sensory organs in the sites specified by its cis-regulatory sequences.

the drosophila homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) is regulated by complex mechanisms that specify the spatial domain, the timing and the activity of the gene in individual tissues and in individual cells. in early embryonic development, ubx expression is controlled by segmentation genes turned on earlier in the developmental hierarchy. correct ubx expression depends on multiple regulatory sequences located outside the basal promoter. here we report that a 500 bp dna fragment from the bx region of the ubx unit, approximately 30 kb away from the promoter, contains one of the distant regulatory elements (bx region enhancer, bre). during early embryogenesis, this enhancer element activates the ubx promoter in parasegments (ps) 6, 8, 10, and 12 and represses it in the anterior half of the embryo. the repressor of the anterior ubx expression is the gap gene hunchback (hb). we show that the hb protein binds to the bre element and that such binding is essential for hb repression in vivo, hb protein also binds to dna fragments from abx and bxd, two other regulatory regions of the ubx gene. we conclude that hb represses ubx expression directly by binding to bre and probably other ubx regulatory elements. in addition, the bre pattern requires input from other segmentation genes, among them tailless and fushi tarazu but not krüppel and knirps.

striped expression of the pair-rule gene hairy (h) plays a central role in regulating segmentation in drosophila. we have used h-lacz reporter gene fusions to delineate h sequences that drive individual stripe expression. we show that 14 kb of 5'-flanking dna directs expression of seven lacz stripes in the blastoderm embryo. within this region, we identify discrete sequences required for expression of individual stripes 1, 5, 6, and 7, and dispersed elements active in the stripe 2 domain. only the stripe 1 element directs lacz expression in an accurate h stripe; stripes 5, 6, and 7 are displaced by one to two cells relative to their h counterparts. these results indicate that regulatory sequences are dispersed within the h promoter. we have determined the sensitivity of the lacz stripes to maternal, gap, and pair-rule gene mutations. our results suggest that different but overlapping subsets of gap genes regulate each stripe and that activation and repression are both important in generating the stripe pattern.

in this study we show that cell fate decisions in the dorsal and lateral mesoderm of drosophila melanogaster depend on the antagonistic action of the gli-like transcription factor lame duck (lmd) and the zinc finger homeodomain factor zfh1. lmd expression leads to the reduction of zfh1 positive cell types, thereby restricting the number of odd-skipped (odd) positive and tinman (tin) positive pericardial cells in the dorsal mesoderm. in more lateral regions, ectopic activation of zfh1 or loss of lmd leads to an excess of adult muscle precursor (amp) like cells. we also observed that lmd is co-expressed with tin in the early dorsal mesoderm and leads to a reduction of tin expression in cells destined to become dorsal fusion competent myoblasts (fcms). in the absence of lmd function, these cells remain tin positive and develop as tin positive pericardial cells although they do not express zfh1. we show further that tin repression and pericardial restriction in the dorsal mesoderm facilitated by lmd is instructed by a late decapentaplegic (dpp) signal that is abolished in embryos carrying the disk region mutation dpp(d6).

limb development requires the elaboration of a proximodistal (pd) axis, which forms orthogonally to previously defined dorsoventral (dv) and anteroposterior (ap) axes. in arthropods, the pd axis of the adult leg is subdivided into two broad domains, a proximal coxopodite and a distal telopodite. we show that the progressive subdivision of the pd axis into these two domains occurs during embryogenesis and is reflected in the cis-regulatory architecture of the distalless (dll) gene. early dll expression, governed by the dll304 enhancer, is in cells that can give rise to both domains of the leg as well as to the entire dorsal (wing) appendage. a few hours after dll304 is activated, the activity of this enhancer fades, and two later-acting enhancers assume control over dll expression. the lt enhancer is expressed in cells that will give rise to the entire telopodite, and only the telopodite. by contrast, cells that activate the dko enhancer will give rise to a leg-associated larval sensory structure known as the keilin's organ (ko). cells that activate neither lt nor dko, but had activated dll304, will give rise to the coxopodite. in addition, we describe the trans-acting signals controlling the lt and dko enhancers, and show, surprisingly, that the coxopodite progenitors begin to proliferate approximately 24 hours earlier than the telopodite progenitors. together, these findings provide a complete and high-resolution fate map of the drosophila appendage primordia, linking the primary domains to specific cis-regulatory elements in dll.

the sgs-7 and sgs-8 glue genes at 68c are divergently transcribed and are separated by 475 bp. fusion genes with adh or lacz coding sequences were constructed, and the expression of these genes, with different amounts of upstream sequences present, was tested by a transient expression procedure and by germ line transformation. a cis-acting element for both genes is located asymmetrically in the intergenic region between -211 and -43 bp relative to sgs-7. it is required for correct expression of both genes. this element can confer the stage- and tissue-specific expression pattern of glue genes on a heterologous promoter. an 86-bp portion of the element, from -133 to -48 bp relative to sgs-7, is shown to be capable of enhancing the expression of a truncated and therefore weakly expressed sgs-3 fusion gene. recently described common sequence motifs of glue gene regulatory elements (t. todo, m. roark, k. vijay raghavan, c. a. mayeda, and e.m. meyerowitz, mol. cell. biol. 10:5991-6002, 1990) are located within this 86-bp region.

we have identified clusters of conserved sequences constituting discrete modular enhancers within the drosophilanerfin-1 locus. nerfin-1 encodes a zn-finger transcription factor that directs pioneer interneuron axon guidance. nerfin-1 mrna is detected in many early delaminating neuroblasts, ganglion mother cells and transiently in nascent neurons. the comparative genomics analysis program evoprinter revealed conserved sequence blocks both upstream and downstream of the transcribed region. by using the aligning regions of different drosophilids as the reference dna, evoprinter detects sequence length flexibility between clusters of conserved sequences and thus facilitates differentiation between closely associated modular enhancers. expression analysis of enhancer-reporter transgenes identified enhancers that drive expression in different regions of the developing embryonic and adult nervous system, including subsets of embryonic cns neuroblasts, gmcs, neurons and pns neurons. in summary, evoprinter facilitates the discovery and analysis of enhancers that control crucial aspects of nerfin-1 expression.

the drosophila gap gene krüppel (kr) displays a complex spatiotemporal pattern of expression during embryogenesis. using p-element transformation experiments, we demonstrate that control elements guiding kr expression in the central or in the anterior domain at the blastoderm stage are each composed of multiple subelements that interact synergistically. we provide evidence that bicoid (bcd) and hunch-back (hb) gene products, as well as at least one other activator, are needed to activate kr expression in the central domain. we localize and describe regulatory elements within the 4.1-kilobase region proximal to the kr promoter that are responsible for expression in the ectoderm, mesoderm, amnioserosa, and nervous system. finally, a protein instability motif encoded in the second exon appears to be important for resetting the dynamic kr pattern.

specific recognition of dna by transcription factors is essential for precise gene regulation. in wingless (wg) signaling in drosophila, target gene regulation is controlled by t cell factor (tcf), which binds to specific dna sequences through a high mobility group (hmg) domain. however, there is considerable variability in tcf binding sites, raising the possibility that they are not sufficient for target location. some isoforms of human tcf contain a domain, termed the c-clamp, that mediates binding to an extended sequence in vitro. however, the significance of this extended sequence for the function of wnt response elements (wres) is unclear. in this report, we identify a cis-regulatory element that, to our knowledge, was previously unpublished. the element, named the tcf helper site (helper site), is essential for the activation of several wres. this motif greatly augments the ability of tcf binding sites to respond to wg signaling. drosophila tcf contains a c-clamp that enhances in vitro binding to tcf-helper site pairs and is required for transcriptional activation of wres containing helper sites. a genome-wide search for clusters of tcf and helper sites identified two new wres. our data suggest that dna recognition by fly tcf occurs through a bipartite mechanism, involving both the hmg domain and the c-clamp, which enables tcf to locate and activate wres in the nucleus.

the sevenless gene encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in a complex pattern during the development of the drosophila melanogaster eye. we have previously shown that this pattern is regulated transcriptionally by an enhancer located in the body of the sevenless gene. here we extend our analysis of the sevenless enhancer, defining a 475-base-pair fragment that contains elements necessary for the correct qualitative and quantitative expression of the sevenless gene. within this fragment are sequence elements conserved in the sevenless gene of a distantly related drosophila species and protected from dnase i digestion by nuclear extracts isolated from adult heads and imaginal discs. partial deletions of the 475-base-pair fragment result in preferential loss of expression in different subsets of cells. these results suggest that the normal pattern of expression is generated by the combined action of separate cell-specific regulatory elements.

the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene in drosophila melanogaster encodes a tgf-beta-like signalling molecule that is expressed in a complex and changing pattern during development. one of dpp's contributions is to proximal-distal outgrowth of the adult appendages, structures derived from the larval imaginal disks. appendage specific mutations of dpp fall in a 20 kb interval 3' to the known dpp transcripts. here, we directly test the hypothesis that these mutations define an extended 3' cis-regulatory region. by analysis of germ-line transformants expressing a reporter gene, we show that sequences from this portion of the gene, termed the dppdisk region, are capable of directing expression comparable to that defined by rna in situ hybridization. we localize two intervals of the dppdisk region that appear to account for much of the dpp spatial pattern in imaginal disks and discuss the positions of these important elements in terms of the genetics of dpp. finally, we provide evidence to suggest that one of our constructs expresses beta-galactosidase in the early imaginal disk primordia in the embryo, at approximately the time when they are set aside from surrounding larval epidermal tissues. thus, dpp may be involved directly in the determination of the imaginal disks.

inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene rb leads to defects in cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, depending on specific cell or tissue types. to gain insights into the genes that can modulate the consequences of rb inactivation, we carried out a genetic screen in drosophila to identify mutations that affected apoptosis induced by inactivation of the retinoblastoma-family protein (rbf) and identified a mutation that blocked apoptosis induced by rbf. we found this mutation to be a new allele of head involution defective (hid) and showed that hid expression is deregulated in rbf mutant cells in larval imaginal discs. we identified an enhancer that regulates hid expression in response to developmental cues as well as to radiation and demonstrated that this hid enhancer is directly repressed by rbf through an e2f binding site. these observations indicate that apoptosis of rbf mutant cells is mediated by an upregulation of hid. finally, we showed that bantam, a mirna that regulates hid translation, is expressed in the interommatidial cells in the larval eye discs and modulates the survival of rbf mutant cells.

ionotropic glutamate receptors (iglurs) mediate neuronal communication at synapses throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. we have characterized a family of iglur-related genes in drosophila, which we name ionotropic receptors (irs). these receptors do not belong to the well-described kainate, ampa, or nmda classes of iglurs, and they have divergent ligand-binding domains that lack their characteristic glutamate-interacting residues. irs are expressed in a combinatorial fashion in sensory neurons that respond to many distinct odors but do not express either insect odorant receptors (ors) or gustatory receptors (grs). ir proteins accumulate in sensory dendrites and not at synapses. misexpression of irs in different olfactory neurons is sufficient to confer ectopic odor responsiveness. together, these results lead us to propose that the irs comprise a novel family of chemosensory receptors. conservation of ir/iglur-related proteins in bacteria, plants, and animals suggests that this receptor family represents an evolutionarily ancient mechanism for sensing both internal and external chemical cues.

the steroid hormone ecdysone triggers coordinate changes in drosophila tissue development that result in metamorphosis. to advance our understanding of the genetic regulatory hierarchies controlling this tissue response, we have isolated and characterized a gene, ecr, for a new steroid receptor homolog and have shown that it encodes an ecdysone receptor. first, ecr protein binds active ecdysteroids and is antigenically indistinguishable from the ecdysone-binding protein previously observed in extracts of drosophila cell lines and tissues. second, ecr protein binds dna with high specificity at ecdysone response elements. third, ecdysone-responsive cultured cells express ecr, whereas ecdysone-resistant cells derived from them are deficient in ecr. expression of ecr in such resistant cells by transfection restores their ability to respond to the hormone. as expected, ecr is nuclear and found in all ecdysone target tissues examined. furthermore, the ecr gene is expressed at each developmental stage marked by a pulse of ecdysone.

the mes4 gene has been identified as one of the maternal dorsal target genes in drosophila. in the present study, we found a dna replication-related element (dre, 5'-tatcgata) in the mes4 promoter recognized by the dre-binding factor (dref). luciferase transient expression assays in s2 cells using mes4 promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids revealed that the dre sequence is essential for mes4 promoter activity. requirement of dre for mes4 promoter activity was further confirmed by anti-beta-galactosidase antibody-staining of various tissues from transgenic flies carrying mes4 promoter-lacz fusion genes. furthermore, wild type mes4 promoter activity was decreased by 40% in dref-depleted s2 cells. these results indicate that dref positively regulates mes4 gene expression. band mobility shift analyses using kc cell nuclear extracts further indicated that the dre sequence in the mes4 promoter is especially important for binding to dref. moreover, specific binding of dref to the involved genomic region could be demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-dref antibodies. these results, taken together, indicate that the dre/dref system activates transcription of the mes4 gene. in addition, knockdown of the mes4 gene in wing imaginal discs using the gal4-uas system caused an atrophied wing phenotype, suggesting that mes4 is required for wing morphogenesis.

wounds in drosophila and mouse embryos induce similar genetic pathways to repair epidermal barriers. however, the transcription factors that transduce wound signals to repair epidermal barriers are largely unknown. we characterize the transcriptional regulatory enhancers of 4 genes-ddc, ple, msn, and kkv-that are rapidly activated in epidermal cells surrounding wounds in late drosophila embryos and early larvae. these epidermal wound enhancers all contain evolutionarily conserved sequences matching binding sites for jun/fos and grh transcription factors, but vary widely in trans- and cis-requirements for these inputs and their binding sites. we propose that the combination of grh and fos is part of an ancient wound-response pathway still used in vertebrates and invertebrates, but that other mechanisms have evolved that result in similar transcriptional output. a common, but largely untested assumption of bioinformatic analyses of gene regulatory networks is that transcription units activated in the same spatial and temporal patterns will require the same cis-regulatory codes. our results indicate that this is an overly simplistic view.

notch is the receptor in one of a small group of conserved signaling pathways that are essential at multiple stages in development. although the mechanism of transduction impinges directly on the nucleus to regulate transcription through the csl [cbf-1/su(h)/lag-1] [corrected] dna binding protein, there are few known direct target genes. thus, relatively little is known about the immediate cellular consequences of notch activation. we therefore set out to determine the genome-wide response to notch activation by analyzing the changes in messenger rna (mrna) expression and the sites of csl occupancy within 30 minutes of activating notch in drosophila cells. through combining these data, we identify high-confidence direct targets of notch that are implicated in the maintenance of adult muscle progenitors in vivo. these targets are enriched in cell morphogenesis genes and in components of other cell signaling pathways, especially the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) pathway. also evident are examples of incoherent network logic, where notch stimulates the expression of both a gene and the repressor of that gene, which may result in a transient window of competence after notch activation. furthermore, because targets comprise both positive and negative regulators, cells become poised for both outcomes, suggesting one mechanism through which notch activation can lead to opposite effects in different contexts.

tastes elicit innate behaviors critical for directing animals to ingest nutritious substances and reject toxic compounds, but the neural basis of these behaviors is not understood. here, we use a neural silencing screen to identify neurons required for a simple drosophila taste behavior and characterize a neural population that controls a specific subprogram of this behavior. by silencing and activating subsets of the defined cell population, we identify the neurons involved in the taste behavior as a pair of motor neurons located in the subesophageal ganglion (sog). the motor neurons are activated by sugar stimulation of gustatory neurons and inhibited by bitter compounds; however, experiments utilizing split-gfp detect no direct connections between the motor neurons and primary sensory neurons, indicating that further study will be necessary to elucidate the circuitry bridging these populations. combined, these results provide a general strategy and a valuable starting point for future taste circuit analysis.

nk-2 proteins are essential developmental regulators from flies to humans. in drosophila, the family member tinman is the major regulator of cell fate within the dorsal mesoderm, including heart, visceral, and dorsal somatic muscle. to decipher tinman's direct regulatory role, we performed a time course of chip-on-chip experiments, revealing a more prominent role in somatic muscle specification than previously anticipated. through the combination of transgenic enhancer-reporter assays, colocalization studies, and phenotypic analyses, we uncovered two additional factors within this myogenic network: by activating eyes absent, tinman's regulatory network extends beyond developmental stages and tissues where it is expressed; by regulating stat92e expression, tinman modulates the transcriptional readout of jak/stat signaling. we show that this pathway is essential for somatic muscle development in drosophila and for myotome morphogenesis in zebrafish. taken together, these data uncover a conserved requirement for jak/stat signaling and an important component of the transcriptional network driving myogenesis.

we have investigated the expression and function of the sox15 transcription factor during the development of the external mechanosensory organs of drosophila. we find that sox15 is expressed specifically in the socket cell, and have identified the transcriptional cis-regulatory module that controls this activity. we show that suppressor of hairless [su(h)] and the pou-domain factor ventral veins lacking (vvl) bind conserved sites in this enhancer and provide critical regulatory input. in particular, we find that vvl contributes to the activation of the enhancer following relief of su(h)-mediated default repression by the notch signaling event that specifies the socket cell fate. loss of sox15 gene activity was found to severely impair the electrophysiological function of mechanosensory organs, due to both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous effects on the differentiation of post-mitotic cells in the bristle lineage. lastly, we find that simultaneous loss of both sox15 and the autoregulatory activity of su(h) reveals an important role for these factors in inhibiting transcription of the pax family gene shaven in the socket cell, which serves to prevent inappropriate expression of the shaft differentiation program. our results indicate that the later phases of socket cell differentiation are controlled by multiple transcription factors in a collaborative, and not hierarchical, manner.

the homeobox gene orthodenticle (otd) controls the process of regional specification that takes place in the drosophila eye-antennal disc during ocelli development. mutations that reduce or abolish otd expression in the ocelli primordium give rise to ocelliless flies. we have identified the cis-regulatory sequence (ocelliless enhancer) that controls otd expression during ocelli development and studied its regulation at the molecular level. the ocelliless enhancer is initially activated by the combined action of wingless (wg) and hedgehog (hh) signaling pathways. later, a positive autoregulatory feedback loop sets in to maintain otd expression. moreover, we have analyzed the role of otd during ocelli primordium development and determined its involvement in the expression of the retinal determination gene eyes absent (eya). otd indirectly regulates eya in ocellar precursor cells through the inhibition of wg, an eya repressor, and the maintenance of hh expression in the ocelli primordium. hh signaling is necessary for eya activation in ocellar precursor cells and this activation is mediated by the full-length activator form of the transcription factor cubitus interruptus.

hox proteins play fundamental roles in controlling morphogenetic diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating distinct sets of target genes. within their rather broad expression domains, individual hox proteins control cell diversification and pattern formation and consequently target gene expression in a highly localized manner, sometimes even only in a single cell. to achieve this high-regulatory specificity, it has been postulated that hox proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a highly context-specific manner in vivo. however, only a few of these factors have been identified. here, we analyze the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the hox protein deformed (dfd) and suggest that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. it follows that context-dependent combinations of hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular hox response elements (hres) could be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of hox targets. thus, a large number of transcription factors are likely to be directly involved in hox target gene regulation in vivo.

drosophila development is regulated by two hormones, 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) and juvenile hormone. we previously found that expression of the e75 gene is induced by both hormones in cultured s2 cells. e75 occupies over 100 kb of genomic dna; it has four alternative promoters producing isoforms e75a, e75b, e75c, and e75d. to identify hormone response elements in the 60-kb noncoding area upstream of the e75a transcription start site, we developed a novel approach combining in vitro, in vivo, and in silico techniques. using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative real-time pcr, we identified five putative enhancers marked with h3k4 monomethylation and depletion of h3. four of these are ecdysone-regulated enhancers, which possess hormone-responsive chromatin and contain sequences sufficient to confer ecdysone inducibility to a reporter gene. using evoprinterhd- and multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation-based computational analysis, we first created a database of short sequences that are highly conserved among 12 drosophila species. within this database, we then identified a set of putative ecdysone response elements (ecres). seven of these elements represent in vivo binding sites for the ecdysone receptor and are necessary for hormone-mediated activation of gene expression in cultured cells. we found that each ecre exhibits different binding and activation properties, and at least some of them function cooperatively.we propose that the presence of multiple ecres with distinct features provides flexibility to the rapid and powerful response of e75a to ecdysone during drosophila development.

the microrna mir-7 is perfectly conserved from annelids to humans, and yet some of the genes that it regulates in drosophila are not regulated in mammals. we have explored the role of lineage restricted targets, using drosophila, in order to better understand the evolutionary significance of microrna-target relationships. from studies of two well characterized developmental regulatory networks, we find that mir-7 functions in several interlocking feedback and feedforward loops, and propose that its role in these networks is to buffer them against perturbation. to directly demonstrate this function for mir-7, we subjected the networks to temperature fluctuation and found that mir-7 is essential for the maintenance of regulatory stability under conditions of environmental flux. we suggest that some conserved micrornas like mir-7 may enter into novel genetic relationships to buffer developmental programs against variation and impart robustness to diverse regulatory networks.

there are two pax6 genes in drosophila melanogaster; eyeless (ey) and twin-of-eyeless (toy), due to a duplication, which most likely occurred in the insect lineage. they encode transcription factors important for head development. misexpression of either toy or ey can induce formation of ectopic compound eyes. toy regulates the ey gene by binding to an eye-specific enhancer in its second intron. however, toy can induce ectopic eyes also in an ey( - ) background, which indicates a redundancy between the two pax6 copies in eye formation. to elucidate to what extent these two genes are interchangeable, we first generated toy-gal4 constructs capable of driving the pax6 genes in a toy-specific manner. genetic dissection of the promoter proximal region of toy identified a 1,300-bp region around the canonical transcription start that is sufficient to drive toy expression in embryonic brain and eye primorida and in larval eye-antennal discs. we find that exogenous expression of toy can partially rescue the lethality and eye phenotype caused by lethal mutations in ey and vice versa. we therefore conclude that toy and ey, to some extent, can substitute for each other. nevertheless, the phenotypes of the rescued flies indicate that the two pax6 genes are specialized to regulate defined structures of the fly head.

post-embryonic development in insects requires successive molts. molts are triggered by ecdysteroids, and the nature of the molt (larval, pupal or adult) is determined by juvenile hormones. the genes encoding cuticle proteins are targets of both classes of hormones, and therefore are interesting models to study hormone action at the molecular level. the drosophila acp65a cuticle gene is expressed exclusively during the synthesis of the adult exoskeleton, in epidermal domains synthesising flexible cuticle. we have examined the cis-regulatory sequences of acp65a using phylogenetic comparisons and functional analysis, and find that only about 180 bp are essential, including an 81 bp intron. the restriction of acp65a expression appears to depend on a strong repression mechanism.

the gene vestigial (vg) plays a key role in indirect flight muscle (ifm) development. we show here that vg is controlled by the notch anti-myogenic signaling pathway in myoblasts and is regulated by a novel 822 bp enhancer during ifm differentiation. interestingly, this muscle enhancer is activated in developing fibers and in a small number of myoblasts before the fusion of myoblasts with the developing muscle fibers. moreover, we show that this enhancer is activated by drosophila myocyte enhancing factor 2 (mef2), scalloped (sd) and vg but repressed by twist, demonstrating a sensitivity to differentiation in vivo. in vitro experiments reveal that sd can directly bind this enhancer and mef2 can physically interact with both sd and twi. cumulatively, our data reveal the interplay between different myogenic factors responsible for the expression of an enhancer activated during muscle differentiation.

drosophila has emerged as an excellent model system in which to study cellular and genetic aspects of hematopoiesis. under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. upon infestation by a parasitic wasp or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. this transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. however, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter gfp or dsred expression exclusively in lamellocytes. the lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential dna recognition element for the ap-1 transcription factor. additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dfos subunit of ap-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. as misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the jun n-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active ap-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals.

a wide range of organisms use sex pheromones to communicate with each other and to identify appropriate mating partners. while the evolution of chemical communication has been suggested to cause sexual isolation and speciation, the mechanisms that govern evolutionary transitions in sex pheromone production are poorly understood. here, we decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution in the expression of a gene involved in sex pheromone production in drosophilid flies. long-chain cuticular hydrocarbons (e.g., dienes) are produced female-specifically, notably via the activity of the desaturase desat-f, and are potent pheromones for male courtship behavior in drosophila melanogaster. we show that across the genus drosophila, the expression of this enzyme is correlated with long-chain diene production and has undergone an extraordinary number of evolutionary transitions, including six independent gene inactivations, three losses of expression without gene loss, and two transitions in sex-specificity. furthermore, we show that evolutionary transitions from monomorphism to dimorphism (and its reversion) in desatf expression involved the gain (and the inactivation) of a binding-site for the sex-determination transcription factor, doublesex. in addition, we documented a surprising example of the gain of particular cis-regulatory motifs of the desatf locus via a set of small deletions. together, our results suggest that frequent changes in the expression of pheromone-producing enzymes underlie evolutionary transitions in chemical communication, and reflect changing regimes of sexual selection, which may have contributed to speciation among drosophila.

the region-specific homeotic gene fork head (fkh) is expressed and required in a variety of tissues of the developing drosophila embryo. in order to identify the cis regulatory elements directing the complex spatio-temporal expression pattern of fkh, we have studied the subpatterns directed by defined fragments of fkh genomic dna. these experiments enabled us to distinguish separate regulatory elements specific for the different expression domains of fkh. in addition, our analysis revealed several unexpected features such as the redundancy of regulatory elements and the overlap of regulatory elements with the transcribed regions of other genes. moreover, the separation of normally contiguous elements effecting expression in the posterior terminal fkh domain appears to lead to novel expression domains which do not correspond to known developmental units in the embryo.

the generation of a functioning drosophila eye requires the coordinated differentiation of multiple cell types and the morphogenesis of eye-specific structures. here we show that d-pax2 plays a significant role in lens development through regulation of the crystallin gene and because crystallin is also expressed in d-pax2(+) cells in the external sensory organs. loss of d-pax2 function leads to loss of crystallin expression in both eyes and bristles. a 2.3 kilobase (kb) upstream region of the crystallin gene can drive gfp expression in the eye and is dependent on d-pax2. in addition, d-pax2 binds to an evolutionarily conserved site in this region that, by itself, is sufficient to drive gfp expression in the eye. however, mutation of this site does not greatly affect the regulatory region's function. the data indicate that d-pax2 acts to promote lens development by controlling the production of the major protein component of the lens. whether this control is direct or indirect remains unresolved.

a key early player in the regulation of myoblast fusion is the gene dumbfounded (duf, also known as kirre). duf must be expressed, and function, in founder cells (fcs). a fixed number of fcs are chosen from a pool of equivalent myoblasts and serve to attract fusion-competent myoblasts (fcms) to fuse with them to form a multinucleate muscle-fibre. the spatial and temporal regulation of duf expression and function are important and play a deciding role in choice of fibre number, location and perhaps size. we have used a combination of bioinformatics and functional enhancer deletion approaches to understand the regulation of duf. by transgenic enhancer-reporter deletion analysis of the duf regulatory region, we found that several distinct enhancer modules regulate duf expression in specific muscle founders of the embryo and the adult. in addition to existing bioinformatics tools, we used a new program for analysis of regulatory sequence, phylogibbs-mp, whose development was largely motivated by the requirements of this work. the results complement our deletion analysis by identifying transcription factors whose predicted binding regions match with our deletion constructs. experimental evidence for the relevance of some of these tf binding sites comes from available chip-on-chip from the literature, and from our analysis of localization of myogenic transcription factors with duf enhancer reporter gene expression. our results demonstrate the complex regulation in each founder cell of a gene that is expressed in all founder cells. they provide evidence for transcriptional control--both activation and repression--as an important player in the regulation of myoblast fusion. the set of enhancer constructs generated will be valuable in identifying novel trans-acting factor-binding sites and chromatin regulation during myoblast fusion in drosophila. our results and the bioinformatics tools developed provide a basis for the study of the transcriptional regulation of other complex genes.

the clock-cycle (clk-cyc) heterodimer lies at the heart of the circadian oscillator mechanism in drosophila, yet little is known about the identity of transcription factors that regulate the expression of clk and/or cyc. here, the authors have used a transgenic approach to isolate regions of the clk locus that are necessary for expression in central oscillator neurons in the adult fly brain. this analysis shows that central clock cells can be subdivided into 2 distinct groups based on clk gene regulation. expression in the lateral neuron (ln), dorsal neuron 1 anterior (dn1a) and 2 (dn2) clusters requires cis-elements located in a 122 base-pair (bp) region (-206 to -84) of the clk promoter. expression in the remaining dorsal neurons, 1 posterior (dn1p) and 3 (dn3) and the lateral posterior neurons (lpn), requires regulatory elements located in the -856 to -206 region. in addition, expression in photoreceptors of the compound eye is enhanced by cis-elements located in a 3rd region of the clk locus (-1982 to -856). this region also enhances expression in nonoscillator cells in the brain including the kenyon cells, but expression in these neurons is suppressed by regulatory sites located further upstream of -1982. the authors' analysis reveals clear heterogeneity in clk gene expression in the adult brain and provides a necessary focus to isolate novel transcription factors that bind at the clk locus to regulate expression in different oscillator neuron subgroups. these results also suggest that the dn1a/dn2 neurons may have more molecular commonality with the lns than they do with the dn1p/dn3/lpn neurons. finally, this analysis has generated new transgenic lines that will enable genes to be misexpressed in subgroups of central oscillator cells that have previously been resistant to discrete genetic manipulation. hence, these lines provide important new tools to facilitate a more complete dissection of the neural network that regulates output rhythms in physiology and behavior.

the drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) upstream element is an enhancer-like element that is required for the correct expression of ftz in developing embryos and that directs transcription from a minimal promoter in a ftz-like seven-striped pattern. using a deletion analysis, we have identified several independent cis-regulatory elements in the upstream element. a distal enhancer directs fusion gene expression in seven stripes primarily in the mesoderm. a more complex proximal enhancer contains a mesodermally active element and a second element with which it interacts to generate seven stripes in the ectoderm. striped expression directed by each enhancer is ftz-dependent, and each contains binding sites for purified ftz homeo domain. we suggest that ftz protein acts in combination with germ layer-restricted transcription factors directly and positively to regulate the transcription of its own gene.

neural maps are emergent, highly ordered structures that are essential for organizing and presenting synaptic information. within the embryonic nervous system of drosophila motoneuron dendrites are organized topographically as a myotopic map that reflects their pattern of innervation in the muscle field. here we reveal that this fundamental organizational principle exists in adult drosophila, where the dendrites of leg motoneurons also generate a myotopic map. a single postembryonic neuroblast sequentially generates different leg motoneuron subtypes, starting with those innervating proximal targets and medial neuropil regions and producing progeny that innervate distal muscle targets and lateral neuropil later in the lineage. thus the cellular distinctions in peripheral targets and central dendritic domains, which make up the myotopic map, are linked to the birth-order of these motoneurons. our developmental analysis of dendrite growth reveals that this myotopic map is generated by targeting. we demonstrate that the medio-lateral positioning of motoneuron dendrites in the leg neuropil is controlled by the midline signalling systems slit-robo and netrin-fra. these results reveal that dendritic targeting plays a major role in the formation of myotopic maps and suggests that the coordinate spatial control of both pre- and postsynaptic elements by global neuropilar signals may be an important mechanism for establishing the specificity of synaptic connections.

the drosophila bithorax complex (bx-c) controls segmental development by selectively deploying three protein products, ubx, abd-a and abd-b, within specific segments along the body axis. expression of these products within any one segment (or, more accurately, parasegment) is affected by mutations clustered in a particular region of the bx-c. the regulatory regions defined by this genetic analysis span 20-50 kb and there is one region for each segmental unit. here we describe regulatory elements from several of these regions, identified by fusion to a ubx-lacz gene and analysis in germline transformants. a small dna fragment from the abx region programs expression with an anterior boundary in the second thoracic segment (parasegment 5). this anterior limit is appropriate, since the abx region normally controls ubx in parasegment 5. other regulatory regions of the bx-c that control development of parasegments 6, 7 or 8 contain similar regulatory elements that program expression with anterior limits in parasegments 6, 7 or 8, respectively. these experiments define a class of bx-c regulatory elements that control expression along the anterior-posterior axis. the early appearance of the lacz patterns in embryos suggests a role for these elements in the initial activation of expression from the bx-c.

the drosophila neurectoderm is initially subdivided across the dorsoventral (dv) axis into three domains that are defined by the expression of three homeodomain containing proteins. these are from ventral to dorsal: ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind) and muscle segment homeobox (msh). this is remarkably similar to the distribution of the orthologous homeodomain proteins in the developing neural tube of mice and zebrafish. this pattern is partially governed by a 'ventral dominance' mechanism, in which vnd represses ind and ind represses msh. a major unanswered question in this process is: how does ind direct positioning of the ventral border of msh expression. toward this goal, we have identified regulatory dna essential for expression of msh in the early neurectoderm. in addition, we demonstrated that ind acts directly in this element by a combination of genetic and molecular experiments. specifically, expression is expanded ventrally in ind mutant embryos and ind protein directly and specifically bound to the msh regulatory dna, and this interaction was required to limit the ventral boundary of msh expression.

the stable determination of different anterior-posterior regions of the drosophila embryo is controlled by the persistent expression of homeotic selector genes. one mechanism that has been proposed to explain the persistent expression of the homeotic gene deformed is an autoactivation circuit that would be used once deformed expression had been established by earlier acting patterning genes. here we show that a large cis-regulatory element mapping approximately 5 kb upstream of the deformed transcription start has the properties predicted for a deformed autoregulatory enhancer. this element provides late, spatially localized expression in the epidermal cells of the maxillary and mandibular segments which is wholly dependent upon endogenous deformed function. in addition, the autoregulatory enhancer can be activated ectopically in embryos and in imaginal disc cells by ectopic expression of deformed protein. deletion analysis of the autoregulatory element indicates that it contains compartment specific sub-elements similar to those of other homeotic loci.

homeotic/hox genes are known to specify a given developmental pathway by regulating the expression of downstream effector genes. during embryonic cns development of drosophila, the hox protein abdominal-a (abda) is required for the specification of the abdominal nb6-4 lineage. it does so by down regulating the expression of the cell cycle regulator gene dcyclin e (cyce). cyce is normally expressed in the thoracic nb6-4 lineage to give rise to mixed lineage of neurons and glia, while only glial cells are produced from the abdominal nb6-4 lineage due to the repression of cyce by abda. here we investigate how abda represses the expression of cyce to define the abdominal fate of a single nb6-4 precursor cell. we analyze, both in vitro and in vivo, the regulation of a 1.9 kb cns-specific cyce enhancer element in the abdominal nb6-4 lineage. we show that cyce is a direct target of abda and it binds to the cns specific enhancer of cyce to specifically repress the enhancer activity in vivo. our results suggest preferential involvement of a series of multiple abda binding sites to selectively enhance the repression of cyce transcription. furthermore, our data suggest a complex network to regulate cyce expression where abda functions as a key regulator.

most developmentally programmed cell death in metazoans is mediated by caspases. during drosophila metamorphosis, obsolete tissues, including the midgut and salivary glands, are removed by programmed cell death [1]. the initiator caspase dronc and its activator ark are required for the death of salivary glands, but not for midgut removal [2, 3]. in addition to caspases, complete removal of salivary glands requires autophagy [4]. however, the contribution of autophagy to midgut cell death has not been explored. examination of combined mutants of the main initiator and effector caspases revealed that the canonical apoptotic pathway is not required for midgut cell death. further analyses revealed that the caspase decay is responsible for most of the caspase activity in dying midguts, yet inhibition of this activity has no effect on midgut removal. by contrast, midgut degradation was severely delayed by inhibition of autophagy, and this occurred without a decrease in caspase activity. surprisingly, the combined inhibition of caspases and autophagy did not result in an additional delay in midgut removal. together, our results indicate that autophagy, not caspases, is essential for midgut programmed cell death, providing the first in vivo evidence of caspase-independent programmed cell death that requires autophagy despite the presence of high caspase activity.

social interactions depend on individuals recognizing each other, and in this context many organisms use chemical signals to indicate species and sex. cuticular hydrocarbon signals are used by insects, including drosophila melanogaster, to distinguish conspecific individuals from others. these chemicals also contribute to intraspecific courtship and mating interactions. however, the possibility that sex and species identification are linked by common chemical signalling mechanisms has not been formally tested. here we provide direct evidence that a single compound is used to communicate female identity among d. melanogaster, and to define a reproductive isolation barrier between d. melanogaster and sibling species. a transgenic manipulation eliminated cuticular hydrocarbons by ablating the oenocytes, specialized cells required for the expression of these chemical signals. the resulting oenocyte-less (oe(-)) females elicited the normal repertoire of courtship behaviours from males, but were actually preferred over wild-type females by courting males. in addition, wild-type males attempted to copulate with oe(-) males. thus, flies lacking hydrocarbons are a sexual hyperstimulus. treatment of virgin females with the aversive male pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cva) significantly delayed mating of oe(-) females compared to wild-type females. this difference was eliminated when oe(-) females were treated with a blend of cva and the female aphrodisiac (7z,11z)-heptacosadiene (7,11-hd), showing that female aphrodisiac compounds can attenuate the effects of male aversive pheromones. 7,11-hd also was shown to have a crucial role in heterospecific encounters. specifically, the species barrier was lost because males of other drosophila species courted oe(-) d. melanogaster females, and d. simulans males consistently mated with them. treatment of oe(-) females with 7,11-hd restored the species barrier, showing that a single compound can confer species identity. these results identify a common mechanism for sexual and species recognition regulated by cuticular hydrocarbons.

dopaminergic neurons are thought to drive learning by signaling changes in the expectations of salient events, such as rewards or punishments. olfactory conditioning in drosophila requires direct dopamine action on intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the likely storage sites of olfactory memories. neither the cellular sources of the conditioning dopamine nor its precise postsynaptic targets are known. by optically controlling genetically circumscribed subsets of dopaminergic neurons in the behaving fly, we have mapped the origin of aversive reinforcement signals to the ppl1 cluster of 12 dopaminergic cells. ppl1 projections target restricted domains in the vertical lobes and heel of the mushroom body. artificially evoked activity in a small number of identifiable cells thus suffices for programming behaviorally meaningful memories. the delineation of core reinforcement circuitry is an essential first step in dissecting the neural mechanisms that compute and represent valuations, store associations, and guide actions.

we present new approaches to cis-regulatory module (crm) discovery in the common scenario where relevant transcription factors and/or motifs are unknown. beginning with a small list of crms mediating a common gene expression pattern, we search genome-wide for crms with similar functionality, using new statistical scores and without requiring known motifs or accurate motif discovery. we cross-validate our predictions on 31 regulatory networks in drosophila and through correlations with gene expression data. five predicted modules tested using an in vivo reporter gene assay all show tissue-specific regulatory activity. we also demonstrate our methods' ability to predict mammalian tissue-specific enhancers. finally, we predict human crms that regulate early blood and cardiovascular development. in vivo transgenic mouse analysis of two predicted crms demonstrates that both have appropriate enhancer activity. overall, 7/7 predictions were validated successfully in vivo, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for insect and mammalian genomes.

development requires the establishment of precise patterns of gene expression, which are primarily controlled by transcription factors binding to cis-regulatory modules. although transcription factor occupancy can now be identified at genome-wide scales, decoding this regulatory landscape remains a daunting challenge. here we used a novel approach to predict spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity based only on in vivo transcription factor binding and enhancer activity data. we generated a high-resolution atlas of cis-regulatory modules describing their temporal and combinatorial occupancy during drosophila mesoderm development. the binding profiles of cis-regulatory modules with characterized expression were used to train support vector machines to predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns. in vivo transgenic reporter assays demonstrate the high accuracy of these predictions and reveal an unanticipated plasticity in transcription factor binding leading to similar expression. this data-driven approach does not require previous knowledge of transcription factor sequence affinity, function or expression, making it widely applicable.

the homeotic selector gene deformed (dfd) is required to specify the identity of head segments during drosophila development. previous experiments have shown that for the dfd segmental identity function to operate in epidermal cells, the dfd gene must be persistently expressed. one mechanism that provides persistent embryonic expression of dfd is an autoregulatory circuit. here, we show that the control of this autoregulatory circuit is likely to be directly mediated by the binding of dfd protein to an upstream enhancer in dfd locus dna. in a 25-kb region around the dfd transcription unit, restriction fragments with the highest binding affinity for dfd protein map within the limits of the upstream autoregulatory element at approximately -5 kb. a minimal autoregulatory element, within a 920-bp segment of upstream dna, has four moderate- to high-affinity binding sites for dfd protein, with the two highest affinity sites sharing an atcatta consensus sequence. site-specific mutagenesis of these four sites results in an element that has low affinity for dfd protein when assayed in vitro and is nonfunctional when assayed in embryos.

many drosophila cytochrome p450 or cyp genes are induced by caffeine and phenobarbital (pb). to understand the induction mechanism, we created drosophila s2 cell lines stably transformed with different luciferase reporter plasmids carrying upstream dnas of cyp6a8 allele of the resistant 91-r strain, and the 1.1-kb upstream dnas of cyp6g1 of the 91-r and the susceptible 91-c strains. following 24 h treatment with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt), caffeine or pb, luciferase activity of all cell lines was determined. results showed that the 0.1-kb dna of cyp6a8 and the upstream dnas of cyp6g1 from both strains are not induced by these chemicals in s2 cells. however, the 0.2-, 0.5- and 0.8-kb dnas of cyp6a8 showed 13-24-, 4-5- and 2.2-2.7-fold induction with caffeine, pb and ddt, respectively. these dnas also showed a 2-3-fold synergistic effect of caffeine and pb but not of caffeine and ddt. the results suggest that the cis-regulatory elements for all three chemicals are located within the -11/-199 dna of cyp6a8. furthermore, caffeine and pb inductions appear to be mediated via different cis-elements, whereas caffeine and ddt induction may involve common regulatory elements. these stably transformed cell lines should help understand the mechanism of resistance-associated cyp gene overexpression in drosophila.

the transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta) family member decapentaplegic (dpp) is a key regulator of patterning and growth in drosophila development. previous studies have identified a short dna motif called the silencer element (se), which recruits a trimeric smad complex and the repressor schnurri to downregulate target enhancers upon dpp signaling. we have now isolated the minimal enhancer of the dad gene and discovered a short motif we termed the activating element (ae). the ae is similar to the se and recruits the smad proteins via a conserved mechanism. however, the ae and se differ at important nucleotide positions. as a consequence, the ae does not recruit schnurri but rather integrates repressive input by the default repressor brinker and activating input by the smad signal transducers mothers against dpp (mad) and medea via competitive dna binding. the ae allows the identification of hitherto unknown direct dpp targets and is functionally conserved in vertebrates.

the evolution of cis regulatory elements (enhancers) of developmentally regulated genes plays a large role in the evolution of animal morphology. however, the mutational path of enhancer evolution--the number, origin, effect, and order of mutations that alter enhancer function--has not been elucidated. here, we localized a suite of substitutions in a modular enhancer of the ebony locus responsible for adaptive melanism in a ugandan drosophila population. we show that at least five mutations with varied effects arose recently from a combination of standing variation and new mutations and combined to create an allele of large phenotypic effect. we underscore how enhancers are distinct macromolecular entities, subject to fundamentally different, and generally more relaxed, functional constraints relative to protein sequences.

drosophila nanos gene plays an important role in stem cell maintenance and body patterning. with the purpose of understanding the cis-regulatory machinery involved in the transcription of the nanos gene in the germline stem cells, we examined its promoter fragment from +97 to -708 relative to the transcription start site and identified enhancer elements located between position -108 and +97. experiments with transgenic flies revealed that the minimal promoter (from -108 to +20) is sufficient in the germline stem cells for the gfp expression in transgenic drosophila. moreover, the flag-tagged nanos protein blotting experiments revealed that a short promoter fragment plus some sequences of the nos 5'utr spanning -108 to +97 could efficiently drive the expression of the flag-tagged [nos-mrna-nos3'utr] transgene in transgenic flies indicating that the cis-regulatory elements located between positions -108 and +97 of the nanos promoter are sufficient to fully transcribe the nanos mrna. deletion of the identified cis-acting sequences from the promoter rendered it non-functional as it could no longer transcribe the nanos mrna in transgenic flies thus revealing the importance of these sequences for the transcription of the nanos gene.

hox transcription factors control many aspects of animal morphogenetic diversity. the segmental pattern of drosophila larval muscles shows stereotyped variations along the anteroposterior body axis. each muscle is seeded by a founder cell and the properties specific to each muscle reflect the expression by each founder cell of a specific combination of 'identity' transcription factors. founder cells originate from asymmetric division of progenitor cells specified at fixed positions. using the dorsal da3 muscle lineage as a paradigm, we show here that hox proteins play a decisive role in establishing the pattern of drosophila muscles by controlling the expression of identity transcription factors, such as nautilus and collier (col), at the progenitor stage. high-resolution analysis, using newly designed intron-containing reporter genes to detect primary transcripts, shows that the progenitor stage is the key step at which segment-specific information carried by hox proteins is superimposed on intrasegmental positional information. differential control of col transcription by the antennapedia and ultrabithorax/abdominal-a paralogs is mediated by separate cis-regulatory modules (crms). hox proteins also control the segment-specific number of myoblasts allocated to the da3 muscle. we conclude that hox proteins both regulate and contribute to the combinatorial code of transcription factors that specify muscle identity and act at several steps during the muscle-specification process to generate muscle diversity.

organismal stress responses to oxidative stress are relevant to ageing and disease and involve key cell-/tissue-specific signal transduction mechanisms. using drosophila, an established in vivo model for stress studies, we show that cell-specific inositol phosphate signalling specifically via inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate 3-kinase (insp(3) 3-k, ip(3)k), negatively regulates organismal responses to oxidative stress. we demonstrate that the drosophila malpighian tubule (equivalent to vertebrate kidney and liver) is a key epithelial sensor for organismal oxidative stress responses: precise targeting of either gain-of-function constructs of drosophila ip(3)ks (ip(3)k-1 and ip(3)k-2), or loss-of-function (rnai) constructs to only one cell type in tubule reversibly modulates survival of stress-challenged adult flies. in vivo, targeted ip(3)k-1 directly increases h(2)o(2) production, pro-apoptotic caspase-9 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. the mitochondrial calcium load in tubule principal cells-assessed by luminescent and fluorescent genetically-encoded mitochondrial calcium reporters-is significantly increased by ip(3)k-1 under oxidative stress conditions, leading to apoptosis. the drosophila orthologues of human apoptotic bcl-2 genes include debcl and buffy. oxidative stress challenge does not modulate gene expression of either debcl or buffy in tubules; and altered debcl expression does not influence survival rates under oxidative stress challenge. finally, targeted over-expression of either debcl or buffy to tubule principal cells does not impact on tubule caspase-9 activity. thus, ip(3)k-1 modulates epithelial cell apoptosis without involvement of bcl-2-type proteins.

the glass gene encodes a zinc finger protein required for normal photoreceptor cell development in drosophila. we show that glass transcripts are present in the third-instar eye-imaginal disc starting in the morphogenetic furrow and extending to the posterior margin of the disc; glass protein is detected in the nuclei of all cells in this region. we also show that glass encodes a site-specific dna-binding protein. a 27-bp glass-binding site can confer glass-dependent expression on a reporter gene in developing photoreceptor cells, the particular subset of glass-expressing cells known to require glass function. this specificity may represent a regulation of glass protein activity after cells are recruited to the photoreceptor cell fate.

"proteasomes are large multisubunit complexes responsible for regulated protein degradation. made of a core particle (20s) and regulatory caps (19s), proteasomal proteins are encoded by at least 33 genes, of which 12 have been shown to have testis-specific isoforms in drosophila melanogaster. pros28.1a (also known as prosalpha4t1), a young retroduplicate copy of pros28.1 (also known as prosalpha4), is one of these isoforms. it is present in the d. melanogaster subgroup and was previously shown to be testis-specific in d. melanogaster. here, we show its testis-specific transcription in all d. melanogaster subgroup species. due to this conserved pattern of expression in the species harboring this insertion, we initially expected that a regulatory region common to these species evolved prior to the speciation event. we determined that the region driving testis expression in d. melanogaster is not far from the coding region (within 272 bp upstream of the atg). however, different transcription start sites (tsss) are used in d. melanogaster and d. simulans, and a ""broad"" transcription start site is used in d. yakuba. these results suggest one of the following scenarios: (1) there is a conserved motif in the 5' region of the gene that can be used as an upstream or downstream element or at different distance depending on the species; (2) different species evolved diverse regulatory sequences for the same pattern of expression (i.e., ""tss turnover""); or (3) the transcription start site can be broad or narrow depending on the species. this work reveals the difficulties of studying gene regulation in one species and extrapolating those findings to close relatives."

the ventral veinless (vvl) and trachealess (trh) genes are determinants of the drosophila trachea. early in development both genes are independently activated in the tracheal primordia by signals that are ill defined. mutants blocking jak/stat signaling at any level do not form a tracheal tree suggesting that stat92e may be an upstream transcriptional activator of the early trachea determinants. to test this hypothesis we have searched for stat92e responsive enhancers activating the expression of vvl and trh in the tracheal primordia. we show that stat92e regulated enhancers can be rapidly and efficiently isolated by focusing the analysis on genomic regions with clusters of putative stat binding sites where at least some of them are phylogenetically conserved. detailed analysis of a vvl early tracheal enhancer shows that non-conserved sites collaborate with conserved sites for enhancer activation. we find that stat92e regulated enhancers can be located as far 60 kb from the promoters. our results indicate that vvl and trh are independently activated by stat92e which is the most important transcription factor required for trachea specification.

the pev-modifying winged-helix/forkhead domain transcription factor jumu of drosophila is an essential protein of pleiotropic function. the correct gene dose of jumu is required for nucleolar integrity and correct nucleolus function. overexpression of jumu results in bloating of euchromatic chromosome arms, displacement of the jumu protein from the chromocenter and the nucleolus, fragile weak points, and disrupted chromocenter of polytene chromosomes. overexpression of the acidic c terminus of jumu alone causes nucleolus disorganization. in addition, euchromatic genes are overexpressed and hp1, which normally accumulates in the pericentric heterochromatin and spreads into euchromatic chromosome arms, although h3-k9 di-methylation remains restricted to the pericentric heterochromatin. the human winged-helix nude gene shows similarities to jumu and its overexpression in drosophila causes bristle mutations.

cilia were present in the earliest eukaryotic ancestor and underlie many biological processes ranging from cell motility and propulsion of extracellular fluids to sensory physiology. we investigated the contribution of the touch insensitive larva b (tilb) gene to cilia function in drosophila melanogaster. mutants of tilb exhibit dysfunction in sperm flagella and ciliated dendrites of chordotonal organs that mediate hearing and larval touch sensitivity. mutant sperm axonemes as well as sensory neuron dendrites of johnston's organ, the fly's auditory organ, lack dynein arms. through deficiency mapping and sequencing candidate genes, we identified tilb mutations in the annotated gene cg14620. a genomic cg14620 transgene rescued deafness and male sterility of tilb mutants. tilb is a 395-amino-acid protein with a conserved n-terminal leucine-rich repeat region at residues 16-164 and a coiled-coil domain at residues 171-191. a tilb-gal4 transgene driving fluorescently tagged tilb proteins elicits cytoplasmic expression in embryonic chordotonal organs, in johnston's organ, and in sperm flagella. tilb does not appear to affect tubulin polyglutamylation or polyglycylation. the phenotypes and expression of tilb indicate function in cilia construction or maintenance, but not in intraflagellar transport. this is also consistent with phylogenetic association of tilb homologs with presence of genes encoding axonemal dynein arm components. further elucidation of tilb functional mechanisms will provide greater understanding of cilia function and will facilitate understanding ciliary diseases.

background: bhlh transcription factors play many roles in neural development. cousin of atonal (cato) encodes one such factor that is expressed widely in the developing sensory nervous system of drosophila. however, nothing definitive was known of its function owing to the lack of specific mutations. results: we characterised the expression pattern of cato in detail using newly raised antibodies and gfp reporter gene constructs. expression is predominantly in sensory lineages that depend on the atonal and amos proneural genes. in lineages that depend on the scute proneural gene, cato is expressed later and seems to be particularly associated with the type ii neurons. consistent with this, we find evidence that cato is a direct target gene of atonal and amos, but not of scute. we generated two specific mutations of cato. mutant embryos show several defects in chordotonal sensory lineages, most notably the duplication of the sensory neuron, which appears to be caused by an extra cell division. in addition, we show that cato is required to form the single chordotonal organ that persists in atonal mutant embryos. conclusions: we conclude that although widely expressed in the developing pns, cato is expressed and regulated very differently in different sensory lineages. mutant phenotypes correlate with cato's major expression in the chordotonal sensory lineage. in these cells, we propose that it plays roles in sense organ precursor maintenance and/or identity, and in controlling the number of cell divisions in the neuronal branch of the lineage arising from these precursors.

drosophila tracheal fusion cells play multiple important roles in guiding and facilitating tracheal branch fusion. mechanistic understanding of how fusion cells function during development requires deciphering their transcriptional circuitry. in this paper, three genes with distinct patterns of fusion cell expression were dissected by transgenic analysis to identify the cis-regulatory modules that mediate their transcription. bioinformatic analysis involving phylogenetic comparisons coupled with mutational experiments were employed. the dysfusion bhlh-pas gene was shown to have two fusion cell cis-regulatory modules; one driving initial expression and another autoregulatory module to enhance later transcription. mutational dissection of the early module identified at least four distinct inputs, and included putative binding sites for ets and pou-homeodomain proteins. the ets transcription factor pointed mediates the transcriptional output of the branchless/breathless signaling pathway, suggesting that this pathway directly controls dysfusion expression. fusion cell cis-regulatory modules of cg13196 and cg15252 require two dysfusion:tango binding sites, but additional sequences modulate the breadth of activation in different fusion cell classes. these results begin to decode the regulatory circuitry that guides transcriptional activation of genes required for fusion cell morphogenesis.

the detection of water and the regulation of water intake are essential for animals to maintain proper osmotic homeostasis. drosophila and other insects have gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the recognition of external water sources, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for water taste detection. here we identify a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family, ppk28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioural response to water. we use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons, and that loss of ppk28 abolishes water sensitivity. moreover, ectopic expression of ppk28 confers water sensitivity to bitter-sensing gustatory neurons in the fly and sensitivity to hypo-osmotic solutions when expressed in heterologous cells. these studies link an osmosensitive ion channel to water taste detection and drinking behaviour, providing the framework for examining the molecular basis for water detection in other animals.

"insulators or chromatin boundary are dna elements that organize the genome into discrete regulatory domains by limiting the actions of enhancers and silencers through a ""positional-blocking mechanism"". the role of these sequences, both in modulation of the enhancers range of action (enhancer-promoter selectivity) and in the organization of the chromatin in functional domains, is emerging strongly in these last years. there is a great interest in identifying new insulators because deeper knowledge of these elements can help understand how cis-regulatory elements coordinate the expression of the target genes. however, while insulators are critical in gene regulation and genome functioning, only a few have been reported so far. here, we describe a new insulator sequence that is located in the 5'utr of the drosophila retrotransposon zam. we have used an ""enhancer-blocking assay"" to test its effects on the activity of the enhancer in transiently transfected drosophila s2r(+) cell line. moreover, we show that the new insulator is able to affect significantly the enhancer-promoter interaction in the human cell line hek293. these results suggest the possibility of employing the zam insulator in gene transfer protocols from insects to mammals in order to counteract the transgene positional and genotoxic effects."

dopamine is a mediator of the stimulant properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol, in mammals and in the fruit fly drosophila. the neural substrates for the stimulant actions of ethanol in flies are not known. we show that a subset of dopamine neurons and their targets, through the action of the d1-like dopamine receptor dopr, promote locomotor activation in response to acute ethanol exposure. a bilateral pair of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain mediates the enhanced locomotor activity induced by ethanol exposure, and promotes locomotion when directly activated. these neurons project to the central complex ellipsoid body, a structure implicated in regulating motor behaviors. ellipsoid body neurons are required for ethanol-induced locomotor activity and they express dopr. elimination of dopr blunts the locomotor activating effects of ethanol, and this behavior can be restored by selective expression of dopr in the ellipsoid body. these data tie the activity of defined dopamine neurons to d1-like dopr-expressing neurons to form a neural circuit that governs acute responding to ethanol.

daily rhythms of behavior are controlled by a circuit of circadian pacemaking neurons. in drosophila, 150 pacemakers participate in this network, and recent observations suggest that the network is divisible into m and e oscillators, which normally interact and synchronize. sixteen oscillator neurons (the small and large lateral neurons [lnvs]) express a neuropeptide called pigment-dispersing factor (pdf) whose signaling is often equated with m oscillator output. given the significance of pdf signaling to numerous aspects of behavioral and molecular rhythms, determining precisely where and how signaling via the pdf receptor (pdfr) occurs is now a central question in the field. here we show that gal4-mediated rescue of pdfr phenotypes using a uas-pdfr transgene is insufficient to provide complete behavioral rescue. in contrast, we describe a approximately 70-kb pdf receptor (pdfr) transgene that does rescue the entire pdfr circadian behavioral phenotype. the transgene is widely but heterogeneously expressed among pacemakers, and also among a limited number of non-pacemakers. our results support an important hypothesis: the small lnv cells directly target a subset of the other crucial pacemaker neurons cells. furthermore, expression of the transgene confirms an autocrine feedback signaling by pdf back to pdf-expressing cells. finally, the results present an unexpected pdf receptor site: the large lnv cells appear to target a population of non-neuronal cells that resides at the base of the eye.

the gene odd paired (opa), a drosophila homolog of the zinc finger protein of the cerebellum (zic) family of mammalian transcription factors, plays roles in embryonic segmentation and development of the adult head. we have determined the preferred dna binding sequence of opa by selex and shown that it is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription of reporter gene constructs under opa control in transgenic flies. we have found a related sequence in the enhancer region of an opa-responsive gene, sloppy paired 1. this site also responds to opa in reporter constructs in vivo. however, nucleotide alterations that abolish the ability of opa to bind this site in vitro have no effect on the ability of opa to activate expression from constructs bearing these mutations in vivo. these data suggest that while opa can function in vivo as a sequence specific transcriptional regulator, it does not require dna binding for transcriptional activation.

the relatively simple combinatorial rules responsible for establishing the initial metameric expression of sloppy-paired-1 (slp1) in the drosophila blastoderm embryo make this system an attractive model for investigating the mechanism of regulation by pair-rule transcription factors. this investigation of slp1 cis-regulatory architecture identifies two distinct elements, a proximal early stripe element (pese) and a distal early stripe element (dese) located from -3.1kb to -2.5kb and from -8.1kb to -7.1kb upstream of the slp1 promoter, respectively, that mediate this early regulation. the proximal element expresses only even-numbered stripes and mediates repression by even-skipped (eve) as well as by the combination of runt and fushi-tarazu (ftz). a 272 basepair sub-element of pese retains an eve-dependent repression, but is expressed throughout the even-numbered parasegments due to the loss of repression by runt and ftz. in contrast, the distal element expresses both odd and even-numbered stripes and also drives inappropriate expression in the anterior half of the odd-numbered parasegments due to an inability to respond to repression by eve. importantly, a composite reporter gene containing both early stripe elements recapitulates pair-rule gene-dependent regulation in a manner beyond what is expected from combining their individual patterns. these results indicate that interactions involving distinct cis-elements contribute to the proper integration of pair-rule regulatory information. a model fully accounting for these results proposes that metameric slp1 expression is achieved through the runt-dependent regulation of interactions between these two pair-rule response elements and the slp1 promoter.

innate immunity operates as a first line of defense in multicellular organisms against infections caused by different classes of microorganisms. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are synthesized constitutively in barrier epithelia to protect against microbial attack and are also upregulated in response to infection. here, we implicate drifter/ventral veinless (dfr/vvl), a class iii pou domain transcription factor, in tissue-specific regulation of the innate immune defense of drosophila. we show that dfr/vvl is highly expressed in a range of immunocompetent tissues, including the male ejaculatory duct, where its presence overlaps with and drives the expression of cecropin, a potent broad-spectrum amp. dfr/vvl overexpression activates transcription of several amp genes in uninfected flies in a toll pathway- and imd pathway-independent manner. dfr/vvl activates a ceca1 reporter gene both in vitro and in vivo by binding to an upstream enhancer specific for the male ejaculatory duct. further, dfr/vvl and the homeodomain protein caudal (cad) activate transcription synergistically via this enhancer. we propose that the pou protein dfr/vvl acts together with other regulators in a combinatorial manner to control constitutive amp gene expression in a gene-, tissue-, and sex-specific manner, thus promoting a first-line defense against infection in tissues that are readily exposed to pathogens.

in drosophila, a population of muscle-committed stem-like cells called adult muscle precursors (amps) keeps an undifferentiated and quiescent state during embryonic life. the embryonic amps are at the origin of all adult fly muscles and, as we demonstrate here, they express repressors of myogenic differentiation and targets of the notch pathway known to be involved in muscle cell stemness. by targeting gfp to the amp cell membranes, we show that amps are tightly associated with the peripheral nervous system and with a subset of differentiated muscles. they send long cellular processes running along the peripheral nerves and, by the end of embryogenesis, form a network of interconnected cells. based on evidence from laser ablation experiments, the main role of these cellular extensions is to maintain correct spatial positioning of amps. to gain insights into mechanisms that lead to amp cell specification, we performed a gain-of-function screen with a special focus on lateral amps expressing the homeobox gene ladybird. our data show that the rhomboid-triggered egf signalling pathway controls both the specification and the subsequent maintenance of amp cells. this finding is supported by the identification of egf-secreting cells in the lateral domain and the egf-dependent regulatory modules that drive expression of the ladybird gene in lateral amps. taken together, our results reveal an unsuspected capacity of embryonic amps to form a cell network, and shed light on the mechanisms governing their specification and maintenance.

the atonal (ato) proneural gene specifies different numbers of sensory organ precursor (sop) cells within distinct regions of the drosophila embryo in an epidermal growth factor-dependent manner through the activation of the rhomboid (rho) protease. how ato activates rho, and why it does so in only a limited number of sensory cells remains unclear. we previously identified a rho enhancer (rhobad) that is active within a subset of abdominal sop cells to induce larval oenocytes and showed that rhobad is regulated by an abdominal-a (abd-a) hox complex and the senseless (sens) transcription factor. here, we show that ato is also required for proper rhobad activity and oenocyte formation. transgenic reporter assays reveal rhobad contains two conserved regions that drive sop gene expression: rhod mediates low levels of expression in both thoracic and abdominal sop cells, whereas rhoa drives strong expression within abdominal sop cells. ato indirectly stimulates both elements and enhances rhoa reporter activity by interfering with the ability of the sens repressor to bind dna. as rhoa is also directly regulated by abd-a, we propose a model for how the ato and sens proneural factors are integrated with an abdominal hox factor to regulate region-specific sop gene expression.

autoregulation is one of the mechanisms of imparting feedback control on gene expression. positive autoregulatory feedback results in induction of a gene, and negative feedback leads to its suppression. here, we report an interesting mechanism of autoregulation operating on drosophila rel gene dorsal that can activate as well as repress its expression. using biochemical and genetic approaches, we show that upon immune challenge dorsal regulates its activation as well as repression by dynamically binding to two different kappab motifs, kappab(i) (intronic kappab) and kappab(p) (promoter kappab), present in the dorsal gene. although the kappab(i) motif functions as an enhancer, the kappab(p) motif acts as a transcriptional repressor. interestingly, dorsal binding to these two motifs is dynamic; immediately upon immune challenge, dorsal binds to the kappab(i) leading to auto-activation, whereas at the terminal phase of the immune response, it is removed from the kappab(i) and repositioned at the kappab(p), resulting in its repression. furthermore, we show that repression of dorsal as well as its binding to the kappab(p) depends on the transcription factor ap1. depletion of ap1 by rna interference resulted in constitutive expression of dorsal. in conclusion, this study suggests that during acute phase response dorsal is regulated by following two subcircuits: (i) dl-kappab(i) for activation and (ii) dl-ap1-kappab(p) for repression. these two subcircuits are temporally delineated and bring about overall regulation of dorsal during immune response. these results suggest the presence of a previously unknown mechanism of dorsal autoregulation in immune-challenged drosophila.

genes include cis-regulatory regions that contain transcriptional enhancers. recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. it has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. we tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of drosophila larval trichomes. at optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. in embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. these temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cdna. finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. these results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability.

the zinc finger protein cf2 is a characterized activator of muscle structural genes in the body wall muscles of the drosophila larva. to investigate the function of cf2 in the indirect flight muscle (ifm), we examined the phenotypes of flies bearing five homozygous viable mutations. the gross structure of the ifm was not affected, but the stronger hypomorphic alleles caused an increase of up to 1.5x in the diameter of the myofibrils. this size increase did not cause any disruption of the hexameric arrangement of thick and thin filaments. rt-pcr analysis revealed an increase in the transcription of several structural genes. ectopic overexpression of cf2 in the developing ifm disrupts muscle formation. while our results indicate a role for cf2 as a direct negative regulator of the thin filament protein gene actin 88f (act88f), effects on levels of transcripts of myosin heavy chain (mhc) appear to be indirect. this role is in direct contrast to that described in the larval muscles, where cf2 activates structural gene expression. the variation in myofibril phenotypes of cf2 mutants suggest the cf2 may have separate functions in fine-tuning expression of structural genes to insure proper filament stoichiometry, and monitoring and/or controlling the final myofibril size.

this study concerns the problem of odor receptor gene choice in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster. from a family of 60 odor receptor genes, only one or a small number are selected for expression by each olfactory receptor neuron. little is known about how an olfactory receptor neuron selects a receptor, or how the nucleotide sequences flanking a receptor gene dictate its expression in a particular neuron. previous investigation has primarily concerned the maxillary palp, the simpler of the fly's two olfactory organs. here we focus on genes encoding four antennal receptors that respond to fly odors in an in vivo expression system. to investigate the logic of odor receptor expression, we carry out a genetic analysis of their upstream regulatory sequences. deletion analysis reveals that relatively short regulatory regions are sufficient to confer expression in the appropriate neurons, with limited if any misexpression. we find evidence for both positive and negative regulation. multiple repressive functions restrict expression to the antenna, to a region of the antenna, and to neurons. through deletion and base substitution mutagenesis we identify gcaatta elements and find evidence that they act in both positive and negative regulation.

the homeobox gene sine oculis (so) is required for the development of the entire visual system in drosophila, which includes the compound eyes, the ocelli, the optic lobe of the brain and the bolwig's organ. during ocelli development, so expression labels, together with eyes absent (eya), the emergence of the ocellar precursor cells in the third instar eye-antennal disc. footprinting and misexpression studies have led to the proposal that the pax6 homologue twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates the initiation of so expression in ocellar precursor cells. however, so expression in a toy loss-of-function mutant background has not been yet analyzed due to the lack of eye-antennal disc development in strong toy mutant alleles. using an embryonic eye primordium-specific enhancer of toy, we have rescued the developmental defect of a strong toy mutant allele and analyzed so expression in the ocelli primordium of toy loss-of-function eye-antennal discs during third instar larva. the results show that so expression is only marginally affected in the absence of toy transcriptional activity and that the toy positive effect on so expression is largely eya-mediated. these results suggest that eya is the main factor controlling both initiation and maintenance of so expression in ocellar precursor cells. in addition, we present the characterization of a new minimal eye/ocellus-specific enhancer of the so gene.

understanding how complex patterns of temporal and spatial expression are regulated is central to deciphering genetic programs that drive development. gene expression is initiated through the action of transcription factors and their cofactors converging on enhancer elements leading to a defined activity. specific constellations of combinatorial occupancy are therefore often conceptualized as rigid binding codes that give rise to a common output of spatio-temporal expression. here, we assessed this assumption using the regulatory input of two essential transcription factors within the drosophila myogenic network. mutations in either myocyte enhancing factor 2 (mef2) or the zinc-finger transcription factor lame duck (lmd) lead to very similar defects in myoblast fusion, yet the underlying molecular mechanism for this shared phenotype is not understood. using a combination of chip-on-chip analysis and expression profiling of loss-of-function mutants, we obtained a global view of the regulatory input of both factors during development. the majority of lmd-bound enhancers are co-bound by mef2, representing a subset of mef2's transcriptional input during these stages of development. systematic analyses of the regulatory contribution of both factors demonstrate diverse regulatory roles, despite their co-occupancy of shared enhancer elements. these results indicate that lmd is a tissue-specific modulator of mef2 activity, acting as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, which has important implications for myogenesis. more generally, this study demonstrates considerable flexibility in the regulatory output of two factors, leading to additive, cooperative, and repressive modes of co-regulation.

the growth and metamorphosis of insects are regulated by ecdysteroid hormones produced in the ring gland. ecdysone biosynthesis-related genes are both highly and specifically expressed in the ring gland. however, the intrinsic regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis has received little attention. here we used the drosophila npc1 gene to study the mechanism of ring gland-specific gene expression. npc1 is important for sterol trafficking in the ring gland during ecdysone biosynthesis. we have identified a conserved ring gland-specific cis-regulatory element (rse) in the npc1 promoter using promoter fusion reporter analysis. furthermore, genetic loss-of-function analysis and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the ecdysone early response gene broad complex (br) is a vital factor in the positive regulation of npc1 ring gland expression. moreover, br also affects the ring gland expression of many other ecdysone biosynthetic genes as well as torso and inr, two key factors in the regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis. these results imply that ecdysone could potentially act through its early response gene br to achieve positive feedback regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis during development.

odorant-binding proteins (obps) function in the perception of chemical signals together with odorant and taste receptors. genes encoding obps form a large family in insect genomes. in drosophila, the evolution of obp gene repertoire has been well studied by comparisons of the whole genome sequences from 12 closely related species. in contrast, their expression patterns are known only in drosophila melanogaster. two obp genes, obp57d and obp57e, arose by gene duplication at the early stage of d. melanogaster species group evolution, followed by the divergence of open reading frame (orf) sequences from each other. while most species in the melanogaster group maintain both obp57d and obp57e, some species have lost either gene, suggesting that the birth-and-death process is a dominating pattern of evolution at the obp57d/e locus. however, it has not been explored whether the expression patterns of these two obp genes are diverged or conserved among species. here, we examined the expression patterns of obp57d and obp57e in the selected species from the melanogaster group using a combination of reporter analysis, rna in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) analysis. as previously reported for d. melanogaster, expression in the chemosensilla on the legs was observed in all the species examined. unlike in d. melnanogaster, however, additional expression in the chemosensilla on the mouthparts was observed in some species including drosophila pseudoobscura, which maintains an ancestral obp gene at the obp57d/e locus. this result shows that, as well as their orf sequences, the expression patterns of obp57d and obp57e have diverged substantially between closely related drosophila species.

the initial expression of the gap gene krüppel (kr) occurs in a precisely bounded central region of the drosophila blastoderm embryo. according to genetic analysis, the spatial limits of the kr expression domain are controlled by the morphogenetic activities of the anterior organizer gene bicoid (bcd) and the anterior gap gene hunchback (hb). using gene fusion analysis, we assayed for cis-acting sequences of the kr gene which mediate transcriptional activation and localized gene expression in response to trans-acting factors. a 730 bp kr control element drives gene expression in place of the endogenous kr central domain. this cis-acting element, kr730, is composed of bcd and hb responsive sequences. they map into regions of multiple hb and bcd protein in vitro binding sites. a 142 bp core fragment containing one low affinity hb and five medium to strong bcd protein binding sites drives gene expression in a kr-like location in the centre of the embryo. our results show that this fragment represents a target for the redundant activator/repressor system provided by the anterior morphogens bcd and hb.

a comprehensive systems-level understanding of developmental programs requires the mapping of the underlying gene regulatory networks. while significant progress has been made in mapping a few such networks, almost all gene regulatory networks underlying cell-fate specification remain unknown and their discovery is significantly hampered by the paucity of generalized, in vivo validated tools of target gene and functional enhancer discovery. we combined genetic transcriptome perturbations and comprehensive computational analyses to identify a large cohort of target genes of the proneural and tumor suppressor factor atonal, which specifies the switch from undifferentiated pluripotent cells to r8 photoreceptor neurons during larval development. extensive in vivo validations of the predicted targets for the proneural factor atonal demonstrate a 50% success rate of bona fide targets. furthermore we show that these enhancers are functionally conserved by cloning orthologous enhancers from drosophila ananassae and d. virilis in d. melanogaster. finally, to investigate cis-regulatory cross-talk between ato and other retinal differentiation transcription factors (tfs), we performed motif analyses and independent target predictions for eyeless, senseless, suppressor of hairless, rough, and glass. our analyses show that cistargetx identifies the correct motif from a set of coexpressed genes and accurately predicts target genes of individual tfs. the validated set of novel ato targets exhibit functional enrichment of signaling molecules and a subset is predicted to be coregulated by other tfs within the retinal gene regulatory network.

cell fate determination depends in part on the establishment of specific transcriptional programs of gene expression. these programs result from the interpretation of the genomic cis-regulatory information by sequence-specific factors. decoding this information in sequenced genomes is an important issue. here, we developed statistical analysis tools to computationally identify the cis-regulatory elements that control gene expression in a set of coregulated genes. starting with a small number of validated and/or predicted cis-regulatory modules (crms) in a reference species as a training set, but with no a priori knowledge of the factors acting in trans, we computationally predicted transcription factor binding sites (tfbss) and genomic crms underlying coregulation. this method was applied to the gene expression program active in drosophila melanogaster sensory organ precursor cells (sops), a specific type of neural progenitor cells. mutational analysis showed that four, including one newly characterized, out of the five top-ranked families of predicted tfbss were required for sop-specific gene expression. additionaly, 19 out of the 29 top-ranked predicted crms directed gene expression in neural progenitor cells, i.e., sops or larval brain neuroblasts, with a notable fraction active in sops (11/29). we further identified the lola gene as the target of two sop-specific crms and found that the lola gene contributed to sop specification. the statistics and phylogeny-based tools described here can be more generally applied to identify the cis-regulatory elements of specific gene regulatory networks in any family of related species with sequenced genomes.

mst36fa and mst36fb are two male-specific genes that are part of a novel gene family recently characterized in drosophila melanogaster. the genes are strictly clustered and show an identical tissue and temporal expression pattern limited to the male germline. here we demonstrate that the transcription of these two genes, which is triggered by different cis regulatory elements, responds to the same testisspecific factors encoded by the aly and can class meiotic arrest genes. rna interference was used to decrease expression of these two genes. we obtained a reduction of fertility in the transgenic adult males compared to the wild type. these data suggest that the mst36fa and mst36fb proteins may have an important role in the production of functional sperm.

it is currently thought that antennal target genes are activated in drosophila by the combined action of distal-less, homothorax, and extradenticle, and that the hox gene antennapedia prevents activation of antennal genes in the leg by repressing homothorax. to test these ideas, we analyze a 62bp enhancer from the antennal gene spineless that is specific for the third antennal segment. this enhancer is activated by a tripartite complex of distal-less, homothorax, and extradenticle. surprisingly, antennapedia represses the enhancer directly, at least in part by competing with distal-less for binding. we show that antennapedia is required in the leg only within a proximal ring that coexpresses distal-less, homothorax and extradenticle. we conclude that the function of antennapedia in the leg is not to repress homothorax, as has been suggested, but to directly repress spineless and other antennal genes that would otherwise be activated within this ring.

hlh54f, the drosophila ortholog of the vertebrate basic helix-loop-helix domain-encoding genes capsulin and musculin, is expressed in the founder cells and developing muscle fibers of the longitudinal midgut muscles. these cells descend from the posterior-most portion of the mesoderm, termed the caudal visceral mesoderm (cvm), and migrate onto the trunk visceral mesoderm prior to undergoing myoblast fusion and muscle fiber formation. we show that hlh54f expression in the cvm is regulated by a combination of terminal patterning genes and snail. we generated hlh54f mutations and show that this gene is crucial for the specification, migration and survival of the cvm cells and the longitudinal midgut muscle founders. hlh54f mutant embryos, larvae, and adults lack all longitudinal midgut muscles, which causes defects in gut morphology and integrity. the function of hlh54f as a direct activator of gene expression is exemplified by our analysis of a cvm-specific enhancer from the dorsocross locus, which requires combined inputs from hlh54f and biniou in a feed-forward fashion. we conclude that hlh54f is the earliest specific regulator of cvm development and that it plays a pivotal role in all major aspects of development and differentiation of this largely twist-independent population of mesodermal cells.

"critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes [1]. they nonetheless produce patterns of gene expression that are the same as or similar to those produced by more proximal primary enhancers. it was suggested that shadow enhancers help foster robustness in gene expression in response to environmental or genetic perturbations [2, 3]. we critically tested this hypothesis by employing a combination of bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) recombineering and quantitative confocal imaging methods [2, 4]. evidence is presented that the snail gene is regulated by a distal shadow enhancer located within a neighboring locus. removal of the proximal primary enhancer does not significantly perturb snail function, including the repression of neurogenic genes and formation of the ventral furrow during gastrulation at normal temperatures. however, at elevated temperatures, there is sporadic loss of snail expression and coincident disruptions in gastrulation. similar defects are observed at normal temperatures upon reductions in the levels of dorsal, a key activator of snail expression (reviewed in [5]). these results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" [6]."

"ionotropic glutamate receptors (iglurs) are a highly conserved family of ligand-gated ion channels present in animals, plants, and bacteria, which are best characterized for their roles in synaptic communication in vertebrate nervous systems. a variant subfamily of iglurs, the ionotropic receptors (irs), was recently identified as a new class of olfactory receptors in the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, hinting at a broader function of this ion channel family in detection of environmental, as well as intercellular, chemical signals. here, we investigate the origin and evolution of irs by comprehensive evolutionary genomics and in situ expression analysis. in marked contrast to the insect-specific odorant receptor family, we show that irs are expressed in olfactory organs across protostomia--a major branch of the animal kingdom that encompasses arthropods, nematodes, and molluscs--indicating that they represent an ancestral protostome chemosensory receptor family. two subfamilies of irs are distinguished: conserved ""antennal irs,"" which likely define the first olfactory receptor family of insects, and species-specific ""divergent irs,"" which are expressed in peripheral and internal gustatory neurons, implicating this family in taste and food assessment. comparative analysis of drosophilid irs reveals the selective forces that have shaped the repertoires in flies with distinct chemosensory preferences. examination of ir gene structure and genomic distribution suggests both non-allelic homologous recombination and retroposition contributed to the expansion of this multigene family. together, these findings lay a foundation for functional analysis of these receptors in both neurobiological and evolutionary studies. furthermore, this work identifies novel targets for manipulating chemosensory-driven behaviours of agricultural pests and disease vectors."

"cis-regulatory modules that drive precise spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression are central to the process of metazoan development. we describe a new computational strategy to annotate genomic sequences based on their ""pattern generating potential"" and to produce quantitative descriptions of transcriptional regulatory networks at the level of individual protein-module interactions. we use this approach to convert the qualitative understanding of interactions that regulate drosophila segmentation into a network model in which a confidence value is associated with each transcription factor-module interaction. sequence information from multiple drosophila species is integrated with transcription factor binding specificities to determine conserved binding site frequencies across the genome. these binding site profiles are combined with transcription factor expression information to create a model to predict module activity patterns. this model is used to scan genomic sequences for the potential to generate all or part of the expression pattern of a nearby gene, obtained from available gene expression databases. interactions between individual transcription factors and modules are inferred by a statistical method to quantify a factor's contribution to the module's pattern generating potential. we use these pattern generating potentials to systematically describe the location and function of known and novel cis-regulatory modules in the segmentation network, identifying many examples of modules predicted to have overlapping expression activities. surprisingly, conserved transcription factor binding site frequencies were as effective as experimental measurements of occupancy in predicting module expression patterns or factor-module interactions. thus, unlike previous module prediction methods, this method predicts not only the location of modules but also their spatial activity pattern and the factors that directly determine this pattern. as databases of transcription factor specificities and in vivo gene expression patterns grow, analysis of pattern generating potentials provides a general method to decode transcriptional regulatory sequences and networks."

serendipity (sry) beta (beta) and delta (delta) are two finger protein genes resulting from a duplication event. comparison of their respective protein products shows interspersed blocks of conserved and divergent amino-acid sequences. the most extensively conserved region corresponds to the predicted dna-binding domain which includes 6 contiguous fingers; no significant sequence conservation is found upstream and downstream of the protein-coding region. we have analysed the evolutionary divergence of the sry beta and delta proteins on two separate levels, their embryonic pattern of expression and their dna-binding properties in vitro and in vivo. by using specific antibodies and transformant lines containing beta-galactosidase fusion genes, we show that the sry beta and sry delta proteins are maternally inherited and present in embryonic nuclei at the onset of zygotic transcription, suggesting that they are transcription factors involved in this process. zygotic synthesis of the sry beta protein starts during nuclear division cycles 12-13, prior to cellularisation of the blastoderm, while the zygotic sry delta protein is not detectable before germ band extension (stage 10 embryos). contrary to sry delta, the zygotic sry beta protein constitutes only a minor fraction of the total embryonic protein. the sry beta and delta proteins made in e. coli bind to dna, with partly overlapping specificities. their in vivo patterns of binding to dna, visualised by immunostaining polytene chromosomes, differ both in the number and position of their binding sites. thus changes in expression pattern and dna-binding specificity have contributed to the evolution of the sry beta and delta genes.

imaginal discs of drosophila have the remarkable ability to regenerate. after fragmentation wound healing occurs, ectopic wg is induced and a blastema is formed. in some, but not all fragments, the blastema will replace missing structures and a few cells can become more plastic and transdetermine to structures of other discs. a series of systematic cuts through the first leg disc revealed that a cut must transect the dorsal-proximal disc area and that the fragment must also include wg-competent cells. fragments that fail to both transdetermine and regenerate missing structures will do both when provided with exogenous wg, demonstrating the necessity of wg in regenerative processes. in intact leg discs ubiquitously expressed low levels of wg also leads to blastema formation, regeneration and transdetermination. two days after exogenous wg induction the endogenous gene is activated, leading to elevated levels of wg in the dorsal aspect of the leg disc. we identified a wg enhancer that regulates ectopic wg expression. deletion of this enhancer increases transdetermination, but lowers the amount of ectopic wg. we speculate that this lessens repression of dpp dorsally, and thus creates a permissive condition under which the balance of ectopic wg and dpp is favorable for transdetermination.

the lymph gland is a specialized organ for hematopoiesis, utilized during larval development in drosophila. this tissue is composed of distinct cellular domains populated by blood cell progenitors (the medullary zone), niche cells that regulate the choice between progenitor quiescence and hemocyte differentiation [the posterior signaling center (psc)], and mature blood cells of distinct lineages (the cortical zone). cells of the psc express the hedgehog (hh) signaling molecule, which instructs cells within the neighboring medullary zone to maintain a hematopoietic precursor state while preventing hemocyte differentiation. as a means to understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling hh production, we characterized a psc-active transcriptional enhancer that drives hh expression in supportive niche cells. our findings indicate that a combination of positive and negative transcriptional inputs program the precise psc expression of the instructive hh signal. the gata factor serpent (srp) is essential for hh activation in niche cells, whereas the suppressor of hairless [su(h)] and u-shaped (ush) transcriptional regulators prevent hh expression in blood cell progenitors and differentiated hemocytes. furthermore, srp function is required for the proper differentiation of niche cells. phenotypic analyses also indicated that the normal activity of all three transcriptional regulators is essential for maintaining the progenitor population and preventing premature hemocyte differentiation. together, these studies provide mechanistic insights into hh transcriptional regulation in hematopoietic progenitor niche cells, and demonstrate the requirement of the srp, su(h) and ush proteins in the control of niche cell differentiation and blood cell precursor maintenance.

in the series of local gene activations that occur during early drosophila development, the striped expression patterns of the pair-rule genes provide the first indication of segmental periodicity. the experiments that we report here address the question of how these patterns arise, by studying the regulation of one of these genes, hairy. we show that each of the seven stripes of hairy expression is controlled by a distinct subset of cis-acting regulatory elements, some mediating transcriptional activation and others transcriptional repression. in general, elements necessary and sufficient for triggering a particular stripe response are clustered on the dna and appear to overlap or be interspersed with elements involved in at least one other stripe response. our results extend previous findings suggesting that periodic hairy expression arises by a decoding process in which each stripe is triggered by particular combinations or concentrations of regulatory factors. these regulatory factors are likely to include the products of the gap class of segmentation genes that are required for activating or positioning particular subsets of hairy stripes and are expressed with overlapping distributions during early embryogenesis.

the major cytoskeletal actin gene of drosophila melanogaster, the actin 5c gene, has two promoters, the proximal one of which controls constitutive synthesis of actin in all growing tissues. to locate regulatory elements required for constitutive activity of the proximal promoter, mutants of this promoter were fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and assayed for transient expression activity in cultured drosophila embryonic schneider line 2 cells. an essential regulatory element has been located 313 base pairs upstream from the cap site. deletion of this element lowered expression to one-third of the wild-type level. the element has the sequence aagttgtagttg, as shown by protein-binding footprinting with the reagent methidiumpropyl-edta-fe(ii). this element is probably not a general one, since it was not detected in a search of the published 5'-flanking sequences of 27 drosophila genes. in addition to this regulatory element, there are five gaga elements in the actin 5c proximal promoter, some or all of which are essential for the promoter activity as shown by an in vivo competition assay. although this promoter has no classical tata element, there is an essential promoter region about 35 base pairs upstream from the cap site that could be a tata surrogate. the promoter also shows sequences homologous to the alcohol dehydrogenase factor 1-binding site and to the core of the vertebrate serum response element, but mutations of these sites did not affect promoter activity in transient expression assays.

we have fused various dna sequences located upstream of the drosophila melanogaster s36 chorion gene tata box to a heterologous basal promoter and reporter gene (hsp70/lacz). the expression of these constructs, following p-element-mediated germline transformation, was examined in 144 independent lines by histological staining of dissected ovaries for beta-galactosidase activity. a short 84 bp segment of the proximal 5' flanking dna was sufficient to confer a wild-type gene expression pattern, including temporal specificity for early choriogenic follicles. surprisingly, initial expression was very localized at the anterior and posterior poles of the follicle. the downstream half of that dna segment permitted expression at both poles, but especially at the anterior tip, while the upstream half only favored expression in the posterior pole; these results suggested the existence of multiple, spatially specific cis-regulatory elements. when the proximal 84 bp segment was placed 1.5 kb upstream of the basal promoter, beta-galactosidase activity was observed in an altered spatial pattern, indicating that the cis-regulatory element(s) that favor expression in the posterior half of the follicle are position independent, while the element(s) that favor expression elsewhere in the follicle are position sensitive. a distal regulatory segment containing redundant dna element(s) specific for expression in the anterior pole was identified much further upstream of s36. thus, the expression of this chorion gene throughout the follicular epithelium is actually composite, occurring in distinct spatial domains under the control of corresponding dna elements.

heart development requires a conserved core of transcription factors comprised of nkx2.5, gata and t-box family transcription factors. in drosophila melanogaster, the nkx2.5 gene tinman acts upstream of many cardiac genes including the tbx20 homolog midline, a critical regulator of heart development in both flies and vertebrates. by testing genomic fragments containing clusters of consensus tinman-binding sites, we identified a 4.3 kb fragment 5' of midline that directs reporter expression in all midline-expressing heart cells and a 1.7 kb subfragment that drives reporter expression in mid-expressing heart cells that maintain tin expression. both fragments direct reporter gene expression in response to tinman in transgenic embryos and in transient transfection assays in drosophila s2 cells. mutation of two tinman binding sites (tin1 and tin2) reduces or abolishes cardiac expression in derivatives of the 1.7 kb fragment. we conclude that tin is a direct regulator of midline in fly heart development.

"engrailed (en) is a segmentation gene expressed in a series of stripes throughout embryonic development. here, i show that regulatory sequences for striped expression are present within the first intron of en. the 1-kb intron is able to confer striped expression early, but not late, in development. this shows that different regulatory sequences are required for en stripes at different times in development. furthermore, stripes generated by the intron are coincident with en stripes in a wild-type background but behave differently from endogenous engrailed stripes in some segmentation mutant backgrounds. thus, although the intron can induce apparently normal stripes, it lacks some of the regulatory sequences present within the endogenous gene. these experiments suggest that multiple regulatory programs control an expression in stripes, and each may be able to confer ""normal"" spatial regulation independently."

this paper examines ovarian transcription of the divergently oriented yolk protein genes 1 and 2 (yp1 and yp2) of drosophila melanogaster. we report germ line transformation results demonstrating that yp1 and yp2 are transcribed in the same subpopulations of ovarian follicle cells. our results show that this expression pattern is directed by two enhancers: ovarian enhancer 1, located between the genes, and ovarian enhancer 2, located within the first exon of yp2. analysis of the expression pattern resulting from alterations in ovarian enhancer 1 demonstrates that different segments of this enhancer have different positive or negative effects on the cell-type specificity of transcription.

the notch cell-cell signaling pathway is used extensively in cell fate specification during metazoan development. in many cell lineages, the conditional role of notch signaling is integrated with the autonomous action of the numb protein, a notch pathway antagonist. during drosophila sensory bristle development, precursor cells segregate numb asymmetrically to one of their progeny cells, rendering it unresponsive to reciprocal notch signaling between the two daughters. this ensures that one daughter adopts a notch-independent, and the other a notch-dependent, cell fate. in a genome-wide survey for potential notch pathway targets, the second intron of the numb gene was found to contain a statistically significant cluster of binding sites for suppressor of hairless, the transducing transcription factor for the pathway. we show that this region contains a notch-responsive cis-regulatory module that directs numb transcription in the piia and piiib cells of the bristle lineage. these are the two precursor cells that do not inherit numb, yet must make numb to segregate to one daughter during their own division. our findings reveal a new mechanism by which conditional and autonomous modes of fate specification are integrated within cell lineages.

krüppel (kr), a gap gene of drosophila, shows complex spatial patterns of expression during the different stages of embryogenesis. in order to identify cis-acting sequences required for normal kr gene expression, we analysed the expression patterns of fusion gene constructs in transgenic embryos. in these constructs, bacterial lacz expression was placed under the control of kr sequences in front of a basal promoter. we identified cis-acting kr control units which drive beta-galactosidase expression in 10 known locations of kr expression in early and late embryos. more than one cis-regulatory element drives the expression in the anterior domain at the blastoderm stage, in the nervous system, the midline precursor cells and in the amino-serosa. in addition, two cis-acting elements direct the first zygotic expression of kr in a striped subpattern within the central region of the blastoderm embryo. both elements respond to alterations in the activities of maternal organizer genes known to be required for kr expression in establishing the thoracic and anterior abdominal segments in the wild-type embryo.

cis-regulatory dna sequences known as enhancers control gene expression in space and time. they are central to metazoan development and are often responsible for changes in gene regulation that contribute to phenotypic evolution. here, we examine the sequence, function, and genomic location of enhancers controlling tissue- and cell-type specific expression of the yellow gene in six drosophila species. yellow is required for the production of dark pigment, and its expression has evolved largely in concert with divergent pigment patterns. using drosophila melanogaster as a transgenic host, we examined the expression of reporter genes in which either 5' intergenic or intronic sequences of yellow from each species controlled the expression of green fluorescent protein. surprisingly, we found that sequences controlling expression in the wing veins, as well as sequences controlling expression in epidermal cells of the abdomen, thorax, and wing, were located in different genomic regions in different species. by contrast, sequences controlling expression in bristle-associated cells were located in the intron of all species. differences in the precise pattern of spatial expression within the developing epidermis of d. melanogaster transformants usually correlated with adult pigmentation in the species from which the cis-regulatory sequences were derived, which is consistent with cis-regulatory evolution affecting yellow expression playing a central role in drosophila pigmentation divergence. sequence comparisons among species favored a model in which sequential nucleotide substitutions were responsible for the observed changes in cis-regulatory architecture. taken together, these data demonstrate frequent changes in yellow cis-regulatory architecture among drosophila species. similar analyses of other genes, combining in vivo functional tests of enhancer activity with in silico comparative genomics, are needed to determine whether the pattern of regulatory evolution we observed for yellow is characteristic of genes with rapidly evolving expression patterns.

coding sequences are usually the most highly conserved sectors of dna, but genomic regions controlling the expression pattern of certain genes can also be conserved across diverse species. in this study, we identify five enhancers capable of activating transcription in the midline glia of drosophila melanogaster and each contains sequences conserved across at least 11 drosophila species. in addition, the conserved sequences contain reiterated motifs for binding sites of the known midline transcriptional activators, single-minded, tango, dichaete, and pointed. to understand the molecular basis for the highly conserved genomic subregions within enhancers of the midline genes, we tested the ability of various motifs to affect midline expression, both individually and in combination, within synthetic reporter constructs. multiple copies of the binding site for the midline regulators single-minded and tango can drive expression in midline cells; however, small changes to the sequences flanking this transcription factor binding site can inactivate expression in midline cells and activate expression in tracheal cells instead. for the midline genes described in this study, the highly conserved sequences appear to juxtapose positive and negative regulatory factors in a configuration that activates genes specifically in the midline glia, while maintaining them inactive in other tissues, including midline neurons and tracheal cells.

many tissues in higher animals undergo dynamic homeostatic growth, wherein damaged or aged cells are replaced by the progeny of resident stem cells. to maintain homeostasis, stem cells must respond to tissue needs. here we show that in response to damage or stress in the intestinal (midgut) epithelium of adult drosophila, multiple egfr ligands and rhomboids (intramembrane proteases that activate some egfr ligands) are induced, leading to the activation of egfr signaling in intestinal stem cells (iscs). activation of egfr signaling promotes isc division and midgut epithelium regeneration, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. iscs defective in egfr signaling cannot grow or divide, are poorly maintained, and cannot support midgut epithelium regeneration after enteric infection by the bacterium pseudomonas entomophila. furthermore, isc proliferation induced by jak/stat signaling is dependent upon egfr signaling. thus the egfr/ras/mapk signaling pathway plays central, essential roles in isc maintenance and the feedback system that mediates intestinal homeostasis.

the drosophila gonadal (gdl) gene is differentially expressed in the male and female germ lines. in males, expression in the gdlm mode results in a 1200-/1500-nucleotide rna pair, whereas in females, expression in the gdlf mode results in a 1000-/1300-nucleotide rna pair. since the two expression modes are a result of alternative promoter usage, the sex-specific transcripts differ at their 5' ends. these sequence differences affect the coding capacity of the gene. a common open reading frame (orf) of 193 codons (orf193) is present in all four gdl transcripts; a consequence of the additional sequences at the 5' end of the gdlm transcripts is the presence of an additional orf of 39 codons (orf39). translation of gdlf and gdlm crnas in a reticulocyte lysate reveals that these transcripts can serve as monocistronic and bicistronic mrnas in vitro. an analysis of germ-line transformants harboring gdl-lacz gene fusions provides information on gdl gene expression during gametogenesis. the fusion genes are transcribed and translated in the germ line; beta-galactosidase activity is detected in premeiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic stages in males, and in nurse cells and oocytes of developing egg chambers in females. both gdlm orfs are used because transformant lines expressing the lacz gene, fused in frame with either orf39 or orf193, are positive for beta-galactosidase activity in the testes. these studies also reveal that separable transcription control elements are responsible for gdl expression in the male and female germ lines.

ionotropic glutamate receptors (iglurs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate chemical communication between neurons at synapses. a variant iglur subfamily, the ionotropic receptors (irs), was recently proposed to detect environmental volatile chemicals in olfactory cilia. here, we elucidate how these peripheral chemosensors have evolved mechanistically from their iglur ancestors. using a drosophila model, we demonstrate that irs act in combinations of up to three subunits, comprising individual odor-specific receptors and one or two broadly expressed coreceptors. heteromeric ir complex formation is necessary and sufficient for trafficking to cilia and mediating odor-evoked electrophysiological responses in vivo and in vitro. irs display heterogeneous ion conduction specificities related to their variable pore sequences, and divergent ligand-binding domains function in odor recognition and cilia localization. our results provide insights into the conserved and distinct architecture of these olfactory and synaptic ion channels and offer perspectives into the use of irs as genetically encoded chemical sensors.

the dpp and fat-hippo signaling pathways both regulate growth in drosophila. dpp is a bmp family ligand and acts via a smad family dna-binding transcription factor, mad. fat-hippo signaling acts via a non-dna-binding transcriptional coactivator protein, yorkie. here, we show that these pathways are directly interlinked. they act synergistically to promote growth, in part via regulation of the microrna gene bantam, and their ability to promote growth is mutually dependent. yorkie and mad physically bind each other, and we identify a 410 bp minimal enhancer of bantam that responds to yorkie:mad in vivo and in cultured cells, and show that both yorkie and mad associate with this enhancer in vivo. our results indicate that in promoting the growth of drosophila tissues, fat-hippo and dpp signaling contribute distinct subunits of a shared transcriptional activation complex, yorkie:mad.

we have previously shown that mst87f (previously called mst(3)g1-9), a gene which is exclusively expressed in the male germ line of drosophila melanogaster, is subject to negative translational control. while transcription of this gene takes place premeiotically, translation occurs only after the elongation of spermatids is complete. we report here the identification of a sequence element within the first 45 nucleotides of the leader which is crucial for this translational regulation. sequence comparison with six other genes, which form a gene family with mst87f, shows the conservation of a twelve nucleotide element within this leader segment. it is found in all genes at positions +28 to +39 of the leader. deletion of this element or alteration of two nucleotides by in vitro mutagenesis both lead to the breakdown of the translational control mechanism. the poly(a) tail of the mst87f mrna becomes longer and heterogeneous in length when the mrna is recruited for translation. we present evidence that the control for this additional polyadenylation also resides within the conserved element of the leader.

the janus locus of drosophila melanogaster displays a very unusual organization. it comprises two partially overlapping genes, jana and janb, which are transcribed in the same orientation; the start of transcription of janb, the downstream gene, is located in the 3' exonic region of jana. both genes are expressed during spermatogenesis. transcription of janb is restricted to this developmental process, whereas jana is ubiquitously transcribed in both the somatic and germinal tissues of males and females. in order to delimit the cis-acting sequences regulating the transcription of janb, the expression of four chimeric janb-lacz genes was examined in transgenic lines by northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and in situ histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase activity. results showed that the testis-specific expression of the janb gene is mediated by a short dna sequence (positions -174 to +107) which is located entirely within the last exon of the upstream jana gene. the tissue specificity of the expression of the janb gene is maintained when most of the jana coding and upstream sequences are deleted. yet the presence in cis of an active jana gene leads to reduced accumulation of the janb-lacz hybrid mrna. this supports the hypothesis that jana transcription interferes with the function of the janb cis-regulatory elements. our results also demonstrate that the 5' untranslated leader of the janb mrna contains translational cis-acting elements, which completely block the translation of the janb-lacz transcripts during the premeiotic stages of sperm development. a janb-lacz construct was used to examine the sexual phenotype of the germline cells of masculinized xx transformer-2 (tra-2) flies. this has enabled us to confirm at the molecular level previous observations that the germline cells of these flies can enter the spermatogenic pathway of differentiation.

rtk/ras/mapk signaling pathways play key functions in metazoan development, but how they control expression of downstream genes is not well understood. in drosophila, it is generally assumed that most transcriptional responses to rtk signal activation depend on binding of ets-family proteins to specific cis-acting sites in target enhancers. here, we show that several drosophila rtk pathways control expression of downstream genes through common octameric elements that are binding sites for the hmg-box factor capicua, a transcriptional repressor that is downregulated by rtk signaling in different contexts. we show that torso rtk-dependent regulation of terminal gap gene expression in the early embryo critically depends on capicua octameric sites, and that binding of capicua to these sites is essential for recruitment of the groucho co-repressor to the huckebein enhancer in vivo. we then show that subsequent activation of the egfr rtk pathway in the neuroectodermal region of the embryo controls dorsal-ventral gene expression by downregulating the capicua protein, and that this control also depends on capicua octameric motifs. thus, a similar mechanism of rtk regulation operates during subdivision of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral embryonic axes. we also find that identical dna octamers mediate capicua-dependent regulation of another egfr target in the developing wing. remarkably, a simple combination of activator-binding sites and capicua motifs is sufficient to establish complex patterns of gene expression in response to both torso and egfr activation in different tissues. we conclude that capicua octamers are general response elements for rtk signaling in drosophila.

many of the key regulators of drosophila cns neural identity are expressed in defined temporal orders during neuroblast (nb) lineage development. to begin to understand the structural and functional complexity of enhancers that regulate ordered nb gene expression programs, we have undertaken the mutational analysis of the temporally restricted nerfin-1 nb enhancer. our previous studies have localized the enhancer to a region just proximal to the nerfin-1 transcription start site. analysis of this enhancer, using the phylogenetic footprint program evoprinter, reveals the presence of multiple sequence blocks that are conserved among drosophilids. cis-decoder alignments of these conserved sequence blocks (csbs) has identified shorter elements that are conserved in other drosophila nb enhancers. mutagenesis of the enhancer reveals that although each csb is required for wild-type expression, neither position nor orientation of the csbs within the enhancer is crucial for enhancer function; removal of less-conserved or non-conserved sequences flanking csb clusters also does not significantly alter enhancer activity. while all three conserved e-box transcription factor (tf) binding sites (cagctg) are required for full function, adding an additional site at different locations within non-conserved sequences interferes with enhancer activity. of particular note, none of the mutations resulted in ectopic reporter expression outside of the early nb expression window, suggesting that the temporally restricted pattern is defined by transcriptional activators and not by direct dna binding repressors. our work also points to an unexpectedly large number of tfs required for optimal enhancer function - mutant tf analysis has identified at least four that are required for full enhancer regulation.

the expression of the hox gene distal-less (dll) directs the development of appendages in a wide variety of animals. in drosophila, its expression is subjected to a complex developmental control. in the present work we have studied a 17kb genomic region in the dll locus which lies downstream of the coding sequence and found control elements of primary functional importance for the expression of dll in the leg and in other tissues. of particular interest is a control element, which we have called lp, which drives expression of dll in the leg primordium from early embryonic development, and whose deletion causes severe truncation and malformation of the adult leg. this is the first dll enhancer for which, in addition to the ability to drive expression of a reporter, a role can be demonstrated in the expression of the endogenous dll gene and in the development of the leg. in addition, our results suggest that some enhancers, contrary to the widely accepted notion, may require a specific 5' or 3' position with respect to the transcribed region.

cis-regulatory modules (crms) function by binding sequence specific transcription factors, but the relationship between in vivo physical binding and the regulatory capacity of factor-bound dna elements remains uncertain. we investigate this relationship for the well-studied twist factor in drosophila melanogaster embryos by analyzing genome-wide factor occupancy and testing the functional significance of twist occupied regions and motifs within regions. twist chip-seq data efficiently identified previously studied twist-dependent crms and robustly predicted new crm activity in transgenesis, with newly identified twist-occupied regions supporting diverse spatiotemporal patterns (>74% positive, n = 31). some, but not all, candidate crms require twist for proper expression in the embryo. the twist motifs most favored in genome chip data (in vivo) differed from those most favored by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (selex) (in vitro). furthermore, the majority of chip-seq signals could be parsimoniously explained by a cabvtg motif located within 50 bp of the chip summit and, of these, cacatg was most prevalent. mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that different twist e-box motif types are not fully interchangeable, suggesting that the chip-derived consensus (cabvtg) includes sites having distinct regulatory outputs. further analysis of position, frequency of occurrence, and sequence conservation revealed significant enrichment and conservation of cabvtg e-box motifs near twist chip-seq signal summits, preferential conservation of ±150 bp surrounding twist occupied summits, and enrichment of ga- and ca-repeat sequences near twist occupied summits. our results show that high resolution in vivo occupancy data can be used to drive efficient discovery and dissection of global and local cis-regulatory logic.

anterior head segmentation is governed by different regulatory mechanisms than those that control trunk segmentation in drosophila. for segment polarity genes, both initial mode of activation as well as cross-regulatory interactions among them differ from the typical genetic circuitry in the trunk and are unique for each of the procephalic segments. in order to better understand the segment-specific gene network responsible for the procephalic expression of the earliest active segment polarity genes wingless and hedgehog, we started to identify and analyze cis-regulatory dna elements of these genes. for hedgehog, we could identify a cis-regulatory element, ic-cre, that mediates expression specifically in the posterior part of the intercalary segment and requires promoter-specific interaction for its function. the intercalary stripe is the last part of the metameric hedgehog expression pattern that appears during embryonic development, which probably reflects the late and distinct establishment of this segment. the identification of a cis-regulatory element that is specific for one head segment supports the mutant-based observation that the expression of segment polarity genes is governed by a unique gene network in each of the procephalic segments. this provides further indication that the anterior-most head segments represent primary segments, which are set up independently, in contrast to the secondary segments of the trunk, which resemble true repetitive units.

"the rhodopsin genes of drosophila melanogaster are expressed in nonoverlapping subsets of photoreceptor cells within the insect visual system. two of these genes, rh3 and rh4, are known to display complementary expression patterns in the uv-sensitive r7 photoreceptor cell population of the compound eye. in addition, we find that rh3 is expressed in a small group of paired r7 and r8 photoreceptor cells at the dorsal eye margin that are apparently specialized for the detection of polarized light. in this paper we present a detailed characterization of the cis-acting requirements of both rh3 and rh4. promoter deletion series demonstrate that small regulatory regions (less than 300 bp) of both r7 opsin genes contain dna sequences sufficient to generate their respective expression patterns. individual cis-acting elements were further identified by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis guided by interspecific sequence comparisons. our results suggest that the drosophila rhodopsin genes share a simple bipartite promoter structure, whereby the proximal region constitutes a functionally equivalent promoter ""core"" and the distal region determines cell-type specificity. the expression patterns of several hybrid rhodopsin promoters, in which all or part of the putative core regions have been replaced with the analogous regions of different rhodopsin promoters, provide additional evidence in support of this model."

systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements is a major challenge in genome science. direct mapping of chromatin modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements. in drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide identification of polycomb response elements, chromatin states, transcription factor binding sites, rna polymerase ii regulation and insulator elements; however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory genome remains a significant challenge. here we describe results from the modencode cis-regulatory annotation project. we produced a map of the drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. we identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. we discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential regulatory relationships.

the proximodistal (pd) axis of the drosophila leg is thought to be established by the combined gradients of two secreted morphogens, wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp). according to this model, high [wg+dpp] activates distalless (dll) and represses dachshund (dac) in the distal cells of the leg disc, while intermediate [wg+dpp] activates dac in medial tissue. to test this model we identified and characterized a dac cis-regulatory element (dac re) that recapitulates dac's medial expression domain during leg development. counter to the gradient model, we find that wg and dpp do not act in a graded manner to activate re. instead, dac re is activated directly by dll and repressed distally by a combination of factors, including the homeodomain protein bar. thus, medial leg fates are established via a regulatory cascade in which wg+dpp activate dll and then dll directly activates dac, with wg+dpp as less critical, permissive inputs.

sphinx is a lineage-specific non-coding rna gene involved in regulating courtship behavior in drosophila melanogaster. the 5' flanking region of the gene is conserved across drosophila species, with the proximal 300 bp being conserved out to d. virilis and a further 600 bp region being conserved amongst the melanogaster subgroup (d. melanogaster, d. simulans, d. sechellia, d. yakuba, and d. erecta). using a green fluorescence protein transformation system, we demonstrated that a 253 bp region of the highly conserved segment was sufficient to drive sphinx expression in male accessory gland. gfp signals were also observed in brain, wing hairs and leg bristles. an additional ∼800 bp upstream region was able to enhance expression specifically in proboscis, suggesting the existence of enhancer elements. using anti-gfp staining, we identified putative sphinx expression signal in the brain antennal lobe and inner antennocerebral tract, suggesting that sphinx might be involved in olfactory neuron mediated regulation of male courtship behavior. whole genome expression profiling of the sphinx knockout mutation identified significant up-regulated gene categories related to accessory gland protein function and odor perception, suggesting sphinx might be a negative regulator of its target genes.

"spatiotemporal changes in gene expression underlie many evolutionary novelties in nature. however, the evolutionary origins of novel expression patterns, and the transcriptional control elements (""enhancers"") that govern them, remain unclear. here, we sought to explore the molecular genetic mechanisms by which new enhancers arise. we undertook a survey of closely related drosophila species to identify recently evolved novel gene expression patterns and traced their evolutionary history. analyses of gene expression in a variety of developing tissues of the drosophila melanogaster species subgroup revealed high rates of expression pattern divergence, including numerous evolutionary losses, heterochronic shifts, and expansions or contractions of expression domains. however, gains of novel expression patterns were much less frequent. one gain was observed for the neprilysin-1 (nep1) gene, which has evolved a unique expression pattern in optic lobe neuroblasts of drosophila santomea. dissection of the nep1 cis-regulatory region localized a newly derived optic lobe enhancer activity to a region of an intron that has accumulated a small number of mutations. the nep1 optic lobe enhancer overlaps with other enhancer activities, from which the novel activity was co-opted. we suggest that the novel optic lobe enhancer evolved by exploiting the cryptic activity of extant regulatory sequences, and this may reflect a general mechanism whereby new enhancers evolve."

extrinsic factors and the interactions of neurons with surrounding tissues are essential for almost every aspect of neuronal development. here we describe a strategy of gene expression with an independent enhancer-driven cellular marker (geem) for studying roles of cell-cell interactions and extrinsic factors in the development of the drosophila nervous system. key to this strategy is robust expression of enhancer-driven transgenic markers in specific neurons. to this end, we have created vectors to achieve bright and even labeling of neuronal processes, easy cloning of enhancer elements, and efficient and flexible generation of transgenic animals. we provide examples of enhancer-driven membrane markers for specific neurons in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and their applications in the study of neuronal projections and connections in the drosophila brain. we further applied geem to examine the wrapping of sensory neuron somas by glia during embryonic and larval stages, and neuron-glia interaction during dendrite pruning in live animals, leading to the discovery that glia play critical roles in the severing and degradation of proximal dendrites. the geem paradigm should be applicable to the studies of both cell-autonomous and nonautonomous regulations of any cell type.

the transcription factor d-pax2 is required for the correct differentiation of several cell types in drosophila sensory systems. while the regulation of its expression in the developing eye has been well studied, little is known about the mechanisms by which the dynamic pattern of d-pax2 expression in the external sensory organs is achieved. here we demonstrate that early activation of d-pax2 in the sensory organ lineage and its maintenance in the trichogen and thecogen cells are governed by separate enhancers. furthermore, the initial activation is controlled in part by proneural proteins whereas the later maintenance expression is regulated by a positive feedback loop.

gradients of diffusible signaling proteins control precise spatial patterns of gene expression in the developing embryo. here, we use quantitative expression measurements and thermodynamic modeling to uncover the cis-regulatory logic underlying spatially restricted gene expression in a hedgehog (hh) gradient in drosophila. when hh signaling is low, the hh effector gli, known as cubitus interruptus (ci) in drosophila, acts as a transcriptional repressor; when hh signaling is high, gli acts as a transcriptional activator. counterintuitively and in contrast to previous models of gli-regulated gene expression, we found that low-affinity binding sites for ci were required for proper spatial expression of the hh target gene decapentaplegic (dpp) in regions of low hh signal. three low-affinity ci sites enabled expression of dpp in response to low signal; increasing the affinity of these sites restricted dpp expression to regions of maximal signaling. a model incorporating cooperative repression by ci correctly predicted the in vivo expression of a reporter gene controlled by a single ci site. our work clarifies how transcriptional activators and repressors, competing for common binding sites, can transmit positional information to the genome. it also provides an explanation for the widespread presence of conserved, nonconsensus gli binding sites in hh target genes.

the 5-ht(7) receptor remains one of the less well characterized serotonin receptors. although it has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of mood, sleep, and circadian rhythms, as well as relaxation of vascular smooth muscles in mammals, the precise mechanisms underlying these functions remain largely unknown. the fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster, is an attractive model organism to study neuropharmacological, molecular, and behavioral processes that are largely conserved with mammals. drosophila express a homolog of the mammalian 5-ht(7) receptor, as well as homologs for the mammalian 5-ht(1a), and 5-ht(2), receptors. each fly receptor couples to the same effector pathway as their mammalian counterpart and have been demonstrated to mediate similar behavioral responses. here, we report on the expression and function of the 5-ht(7)dro receptor in drosophila. in the larval central nervous system, expression is detected postsynaptically in discreet cells and neuronal circuits. in the adult brain there is strong expression in all large-field r neurons that innervate the ellipsoid body, as well as in a small group of cells that cluster with the pdf-positive lnvs neurons that mediate circadian activity. following both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we have found that 5-ht(7)dro activity is essential for normal courtship and mating behaviors in the fly, where it appears to mediate levels of interest in both males and females. this is the first reported evidence of direct involvement of a particular serotonin receptor subtype in courtship and mating in the fly.

the generation of metameric body plans is a key process in development. in drosophila segmentation, periodicity is established rapidly through the complex transcriptional regulation of the pair-rule genes. the 'primary' pair-rule genes generate their 7-stripe expression through stripe-specific cis-regulatory elements controlled by the preceding non-periodic maternal and gap gene patterns, whereas 'secondary' pair-rule genes are thought to rely on 7-stripe elements that read off the already periodic primary pair-rule patterns. using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we have conducted a comprehensive systems-level examination of the regulatory architecture underlying pair-rule stripe formation. we find that runt (run), fushi tarazu (ftz) and odd skipped (odd) establish most of their pattern through stripe-specific elements, arguing for a reclassification of ftz and odd as primary pair-rule genes. in the case of run, we observe long-range cis-regulation across multiple intervening genes. the 7-stripe elements of run, ftz and odd are active concurrently with the stripe-specific elements, indicating that maternal/gap-mediated control and pair-rule gene cross-regulation are closely integrated. stripe-specific elements fall into three distinct classes based on their principal repressive gap factor input; stripe positions along the gap gradients correlate with the strength of predicted input. the prevalence of cis-elements that generate two stripes and their genomic organization suggest that single-stripe elements arose by splitting and subfunctionalization of ancestral dual-stripe elements. overall, our study provides a greatly improved understanding of how periodic patterns are established in the drosophila embryo.

trithorax-group and polycomb-group proteins interact with chromosomal elements, termed pre/tres, to ensure stable heritable maintenance of the transcriptional state of nearby genes. regulatory elements that bind both groups of proteins are termed maintenance elements (mes). some of these mes maintain the initial activated transcriptional state of a nearby reporter gene through several rounds of mitosis during development. here, we show that expression of hedgehog in the posterior compartment of the drosophila wing results from the communication between a previously defined me and a nearby cis-regulatory element termed the c enhancer. the c enhancer integrates the activities of the notch and hedgehog signalling pathways and, from the early wing primordium stage, drives expression to a thin stripe in the posterior compartment that corresponds to the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary. the me maintains the initial activated transcriptional state conferred by the c enhancer and contributes to the expansion, by growth, of its expression domain throughout the posterior compartment. communication between the me and the c enhancer also contributes to repression of gene expression in anterior cells. most interestingly, we present evidence that enhancers and mes of different genes are interchangeable modules whose communication is involved in restricting and expanding the domains of gene expression. our results emphasize the modular role of mes in regulation of gene expression within growing tissues.

morphology evolves often through changes in developmental genes, but the causal mutations, and their effects, remain largely unknown. the evolution of naked cuticle on larvae of drosophila sechellia resulted from changes in five transcriptional enhancers of shavenbaby (svb), a transcript of the ovo locus that encodes a transcription factor that governs morphogenesis of microtrichiae, hereafter called 'trichomes'. here we show that the function of one of these enhancers evolved through multiple single-nucleotide substitutions that altered both the timing and level of svb expression. the consequences of these nucleotide substitutions on larval morphology were quantified with a novel functional assay. we found that each substitution had a relatively small phenotypic effect, and that many nucleotide changes account for this large morphological difference. in addition, we observed that the substitutions had non-additive effects. these data provide unprecedented resolution of the phenotypic effects of substitutions and show how individual nucleotide changes in a transcriptional enhancer have caused morphological evolution.

the notch intracellular domain functions as a co-activator for the dna-binding protein suppressor of hairless (su(h)) to mediate myriad cell fate decisions. notch pathway activity is balanced by transcriptional repression, mediated by su(h) in concert with its drosophila corepressor hairless. we demonstrate that the drosophila neural ben-solo protein insensitive (insv) is a nuclear factor that inhibits notch signalling during multiple peripheral nervous system cell fate decisions. endogenous insv was particularly critical when repressor activity of su(h) was compromised. reciprocally, ectopic insv generated several notch loss-of-function phenotypes, repressed most notch targets in the e(spl)-c, and opposed notch-mediated activation of an e(spl)m3-luc reporter. a direct role for insv in transcriptional repression was indicated by binding of insv to su(h), and by strong chromatin immunoprecipitation of endogenous insv to most e(spl)-c loci. strikingly, ectopic insv fully rescued sensory organ precursors in hairless null clones, indicating that insv can antagonize notch independently of hairless. these data shed first light on the in vivo function for a ben-solo protein as an su(h) corepressor in the notch pathway regulating neural development.

organisms induce the expression of detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome p450s to deal with xenobiotics encountered in the environment. research using cell culture systems has identified some of the cis-regulatory elements (cres) and transcription factors involved in the induction of p450 genes in response to xenobiotic challenges. it was recently found that the cres required for the basal expression of some p450s are distinct from the cres involved in their induction. how these cres mediate induction to xenobiotics in a tissue specific manner is not known. in this paper we show that, in drosophila melanogaster, the induction response of the p450 gene cyp6g1 to the xenobiotic phenobarbital (pb) requires the presence of both tissue specific enhancers and a distinct cre. the cre does not drive gene expression but is required for the induction response. site-directed mutagenesis of sequences within the cre, sequences similar to mouse pb induction sequences, reduces the level of induction by pb, suggesting some degree of mechanistic conservation between flies and mice. this cre may represent a unique class of cres that has no inherent role in the basal transcriptional activity of genes, but is required for induction responses. variations within this class of cres may explain the variability of gene induction responses.

eater is a transmembrane protein that mediates phagocytosis in drosophila. eater was identified in a microarray analysis of genes downregulated in s2 cells, in which serpent had been knocked down by rnai. the gene was shown to be expressed predominantly in plasmatocytes after embryonic development. we have extensively analyzed the transcriptional enhancer controlling eater expression with the following findings: the enhancer reproduces the plasmatocyte expression pattern of the gene as verified by anti-p1 antibody staining and a 526-basepair dna region is active in lymph gland and hemolymph plasmatocytes. this dna contains several gata elements that serve as putative-binding sites for serpent. site-directed mutagenesis of two of these gata sites abolishes eater expression in both lymph gland and hemolymph plasmatocytes. this suggests that serpent regulates eater expression by binding these gata sites, which was confirmed by gel shift analysis. these analyses allowed us to use eater-gal4 to force plasmatocyte to lamellocyte differentiation.

at the drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex (bx-c) over 330kb of intergenic dna is responsible for directing the transcription of just three homeotic (hox) genes during embryonic development. a number of distinct enhancer cis-regulatory modules (crms) are responsible for controlling the specific expression patterns of the hox genes in the bx-c. while it has proven possible to identify orthologs of known bx-c crms in different drosophila species using overall sequence conservation, this approach has not proven sufficiently effective for identifying novel crms or defining the key functional sequences within enhancer crms. here we demonstrate that the specific spatial clustering of transcription factor (tf) binding sites is important for bx-c enhancer activity. a bioinformatic search for combinations of putative tf binding sites in the bx-c suggests that simple clustering of binding sites is frequently not indicative of enhancer activity. however, through molecular dissection and evolutionary comparison across the drosophila genus we discovered that specific tf binding site clustering patterns are an important feature of three known bx-c enhancers. sub-regions of the defined iab5 and iab7b enhancers were both found to contain an evolutionarily conserved signature motif of clustered tf binding sites which is critical for the functional activity of the enhancers. together, these results indicate that the spatial organization of specific activator and repressor binding sites within bx-c enhancers is of greater importance than overall sequence conservation and is indicative of enhancer functional activity.

despite recent advances in experimental approaches for identifying transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (crms, 'enhancers'), direct empirical discovery of crms for all genes in all cell types and environmental conditions is likely to remain an elusive goal. effective methods for computational crm discovery are thus a critically needed complement to empirical approaches. however, existing computational methods that search for clusters of putative binding sites are ineffective if the relevant tfs and/or their binding specificities are unknown. here, we provide a significantly improved method for 'motif-blind' crm discovery that does not depend on knowledge or accurate prediction of tf-binding motifs and is effective when limited knowledge of functional crms is available to 'supervise' the search. we propose a new statistical method, based on 'interpolated markov models', for motif-blind, genome-wide crm discovery. it captures the statistical profile of variable length words in known crms of a regulatory network and finds candidate crms that match this profile. the method also uses orthologs of the known crms from closely related genomes. we perform in silico evaluation of predicted crms by assessing whether their neighboring genes are enriched for the expected expression patterns. this assessment uses a novel statistical test that extends the widely used hypergeometric test of gene set enrichment to account for variability in intergenic lengths. we find that the new crm prediction method is superior to existing methods. finally, we experimentally validate 12 new crm predictions by examining their regulatory activity in vivo in drosophila; 10 of the tested crms were found to be functional, while 6 of the top 7 predictions showed the expected activity patterns. we make our program available as downloadable source code, and as a plugin for a genome browser installed on our servers.

"segmentation of the drosophila embryo begins with the establishment of spatially restricted gap gene-expression patterns in response to broad gradients of maternal transcription factors, such as bicoid. numerous studies have documented the fidelity of these expression patterns, even when embryos are subjected to genetic or environmental stress, but the underlying mechanisms for this transcriptional precision are uncertain. here we present evidence that every gap gene contains multiple enhancers with overlapping activities to produce authentic patterns of gene expression. for example, a recently identified hunchback (hb) enhancer (located 5-kb upstream of the classic enhancer) ensures repression at the anterior pole. the combination of intronic and 5' knirps (kni) enhancers produces a faithful expression pattern, even though the intronic enhancer alone directs an abnormally broad expression pattern. we present different models for ""enhancer synergy,"" whereby two enhancers with overlapping activities produce authentic patterns of gene expression."

drosophila neuroendocrine cells comprising the corpora cardiaca (cc) are essential for systemic glucose regulation and represent functional orthologues of vertebrate pancreatic α-cells. although drosophila cc cells have been regarded as developmental orthologues of pituitary gland, the genetic regulation of cc development is poorly understood. from a genetic screen, we identified multiple novel regulators of cc development, including notch signaling factors. our studies demonstrate that the disruption of notch signaling can lead to the expansion of cc cells. live imaging demonstrates localized emergence of extra precursor cells as the basis of cc expansion in notch mutants. contrary to a recent report, we unexpectedly found that cc cells originate from head mesoderm. we show that tinman expression in head mesoderm is regulated by notch signaling and that the combination of daughterless and tinman is sufficient for ectopic cc specification in mesoderm. understanding the cellular, genetic, signaling, and transcriptional basis of cc cell specification and expansion should accelerate discovery of molecular mechanisms regulating ontogeny of organs that control metabolism.

to sense myriad environmental odors, animals have evolved multiple, large families of divergent olfactory receptors. how and why distinct receptor repertoires and their associated circuits are functionally and anatomically integrated is essentially unknown. we have addressed these questions through comprehensive comparative analysis of the drosophila olfactory subsystems that express the ionotropic receptors (irs) and odorant receptors (ors). we identify ligands for most ir neuron classes, revealing their specificity for select amines and acids, which complements the broader tuning of ors for esters and alcohols. ir and or sensory neurons exhibit glomerular convergence in segregated, although interconnected, zones of the primary olfactory center, but these circuits are extensively interdigitated in higher brain regions. consistently, behavioral responses to odors arise from an interplay between ir- and or-dependent pathways. we integrate knowledge on the different phylogenetic and developmental properties of these receptors and circuits to propose models for the functional contributions and evolution of these distinct olfactory subsystems.

developmental regulatory proteins are commonly utilized in multiple cell types throughout development. the drosophila single-minded (sim) gene acts as master regulator of embryonic cns midline cell development and transcription. however, it is also expressed in the brain during larval development. in this paper, we demonstrate that sim is expressed in three clusters of anterior central brain neurons: damv1/2, bamas1/2, and trdm and in three clusters of posterior central brain neurons: a subset of dpm neurons, and two previously unidentified clusters, which we term plsc and psc. in addition, sim is expressed in the lamina and medulla of the optic lobes. marcm studies confirm that sim is expressed at high levels in neurons but is low or absent in neuroblasts (nbs) and ganglion mother cell (gmc) precursors. in the anterior brain, sim(+) neurons are detected in 1st and 2nd instar larvae but rapidly increase in number during the 3rd instar stage. to understand the regulation of sim brain transcription, 12 fragments encompassing 5'-flanking, intronic, and 3'-flanking regions were tested for the presence of enhancers that drive brain expression of a reporter gene. three of these fragments drove expression in sim(+) brain cells, including all sim(+) neuronal clusters in the central brain and optic lobes. one fragment upstream of sim is autoregulatory and is expressed in all sim(+) brain cells. one intronic fragment drives expression in only the psc and laminar neurons. another downstream intronic fragment drives expression in all sim(+) brain neurons, except the psc and lamina. thus, together these two enhancers drive expression in all sim(+) brain neurons. sequence analysis of existing sim mutant alleles identified three likely null alleles to utilize in marcm experiments to examine sim brain function. mutant clones of damv1/2 neurons revealed a consistent axonal fasciculation defect. thus, unlike the embryonic roles of sim that control cns midline neuron and glial formation and differentiation, postembryonic sim, instead, controls aspects of axon guidance in the brain. this resembles the roles of vertebrate sim that have an early role in neuronal migration and a later role in axonogenesis.

sensory systems with high discriminatory power use neurons that express only one of several alternative sensory receptor proteins. this exclusive receptor gene expression restricts the sensitivity spectrum of neurons and is coordinated with the choice of their synaptic targets. however, little is known about how it is maintained throughout the life of a neuron. here we show that the green-light sensing receptor rhodopsin 6 (rh6) acts to exclude an alternative blue-sensitive rhodopsin 5 (rh5) from a subset of drosophila r8 photoreceptor neurons. loss of rh6 leads to a gradual expansion of rh5 expression into all r8 photoreceptors of the ageing adult retina. the rh6 feedback signal results in repression of the rh5 promoter and can be mimicked by other drosophila rhodopsins; it is partly dependent on activation of rhodopsin by light, and relies on g(αq) activity, but not on the subsequent steps of the phototransduction cascade. our observations reveal a thus far unappreciated spectral plasticity of r8 photoreceptors, and identify rhodopsin feedback as an exclusion mechanism.

hox transcription factors regulate the morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior (a/p) body axis through the interaction with small cis-regulatory modules (crms) of their target gene, however so far very few hox crms are known and have been analyzed in detail. in this study we have identified a new hox crm, ct340, which guides the expression of the cell type specification gene cut (ct) in the posterior spiracle under the direct control of the hox protein abdominal-b (abd-b). using the ct340 enhancer activity as readout, an efficient cloning system to generate vp16 activation domain fusion protein was developed to unambiguously test protein-dna interaction in drosophila cell culture. by functionally dissecting the abd-b protein, new features of abd-b dependent target gene regulation were detected. due to its easy adaptability, this system can be generally used to map functional domains within sequence-specific transcriptional factors in drosophila cell culture, and thus provide preliminary knowledge of the protein functional domain structure for further in vivo analysis.

in drosophila, trunk metamerization is established by a cascade of segmentation gene activities: the gap genes, the pair rule genes, and the segment polarity genes. in the anterior head, metamerization requires also gap-like genes and segment polarity genes. however, because the pair rule genes are not active in this part of the embryo, the question on which gene activities are fulfilling the role of the second order regulator genes still remains to be solved. here we provide first molecular evidence that the helix-loop-helix-coe transcription factor collier fulfills this role by directly activating the expression of the segment polarity gene hedgehog in the posterior part of the intercalary segment. collier thereby occupies a newly identified binding site within an intercalary-specific cis-regulatory element. moreover, we identified a direct physical association between collier and the basic-leucine-zipper transcription factor cap'n'collar b, which seems to restrict the activating input of collier to the posterior part of the intercalary segment and to lead to the attenuation of hedgehog expression in the intercalary lobes at later stages.

identifying the genetic program that leads to formation of functionally and morphologically distinct muscle fibers is one of the major challenges in developmental biology. in drosophila, the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) transcription factor is important for all types of embryonic muscle differentiation. in this study we investigated the role of mef2 at different stages of adult skeletal muscle formation, where a diverse group of specialized muscles arises. through stage- and tissue-specific expression of mef2 rnai constructs, we demonstrate that mef2 is critical at the early stages of adult myoblast fusion: mutant myoblasts are attracted normally to their founder cell targets, but are unable to fuse to form myotubes. interestingly, ablation of mef2 expression at later stages of development showed mef2 to be more dispensable for structural gene expression: after myoblast fusion, mef2 knockdown did not interrupt expression of major structural gene transcripts, and myofibrils were formed. however, the mef2-depleted fibers showed impaired integrity and a lack of fibrillar organization. when mef2 rnai was induced in muscles following eclosion, we found no adverse effects of attenuating mef2 function. we conclude that in the context of adult myogenesis, mef2 remains an essential factor, participating in control of myoblast fusion, and myofibrillogenesis in developing myotubes. however, mef2 does not show a major requirement in the maintenance of muscle structural gene expression. our findings point to the importance of a diversity of regulatory factors that are required for the formation and function of the distinct muscle fibers found in animals.

"the specification of temporal identity within single progenitor lineages is essential to generate functional neuronal diversity in drosophila and mammals. in drosophila, four transcription factors are sequentially expressed in neural progenitors (neuroblasts) and each regulates the temporal identity of the progeny produced during its expression window. the first temporal identity is established by the ikaros-family zinc finger transcription factor hunchback (hb). hb is detected in young (newly-formed) neuroblasts for about an hour and is maintained in the early-born neurons produced during this interval. hb is necessary and sufficient to specify early-born neuronal or glial identity in multiple neuroblast lineages. the timing of hb expression in neuroblasts is regulated at the transcriptional level. here we identify cis-regulatory elements that confer proper hb expression in ""young"" neuroblasts and early-born neurons. we show that the neuroblast element contains clusters of predicted binding sites for the seven-up transcription factor, which is known to limit hb neuroblast expression. we identify highly conserved sequences in the neuronal element that are good candidates for maintaining hb transcription in neurons. our results provide the necessary foundation for identifying trans-acting factors that establish the hb early temporal expression domain."

"the glial cells missing (gcm) gene has been identified as a ""master regulator"" of glial cell fate in the fruit fly drosophila. however, gcm is also expressed in and required for the development of larval macrophages and tendon cells. thus, the gcm protein activates the transcription of different sets of genes in different developmental contexts. how the gcm protein regulates these different outcomes is not known. our goal is to identify proteins that collaborate with gcm to promote the transcriptional activation of gcm target genes specifically in glial cells, or prevent their activation in the other tissues in which gcm is expressed. to address this, we have focused on the transcriptional regulation of a well-characterized glial-specific gcm target gene, the transcription factor reversed polarity (repo). we aim to understand how the transcription of the glial-specific gcm target gene repo is regulated by gcm and other factors. previously we defined a 4.3 kb cis-regulatory dna region that recapitulates the endogenous repo expression pattern dependent on multiple gcm binding sites. we proposed that there may be multiple cis-regulatory sub-regions that drive cell-specific expression independent of gcm binding sites. here, using lacz reporter activity in transgenic lines, we have characterized three cis-regulatory elements: 1) a distal element that promotes expression in dorsolateral epidermis; 2) a repressor element that suppresses expression in the epidermis; and, 3) a proximal element that promotes expression in a subset of cell body glia. most significantly, we have defined a minimal cis-regulatory element that recapitulates the endogenous repo expression pattern dependent on a single gcm binding site."

although it is thought that changes in gene expression play an important role in adaptation, the identification of gene-regulatory sequences that have been targets of positive selection has proved difficult. here, we identify a cis-regulatory element of the drosophila melanogaster cg9509 gene that is associated with a selective sweep in a derived non-african population of the species. expression analyses indicate that cg9509 consistently shows greater expression in non-african than in african strains of d. melanogaster. we find that a 1.8 kb region located just upstream of the cg9509 coding region is devoid of dna sequence polymorphism in a european population sample and that this is best explained by the recent action of positive selection (within the past 4,000-10,000 years). using a reporter gene construct and phic31-mediated site-specific integration, we show that the european version of the cg9509 upstream region drives 2-3 times greater expression than the african version in an otherwise identical genetic background. this expression difference corresponds well to that of the native gene and indicates that sequence variation within the cg9509 upstream region can completely account for its high expression in the european population. selection appears to have favored a quantitative increase in gene expression in the malphigian tubule, the tissue where cg9509 is predominantly expressed.

animals often use sex pheromones for mate choice and reproduction. as for other signals, the genetic control of the emission and perception of sex pheromones must be tightly coadapted, and yet we still have no worked-out example of how these two aspects interact. most models suggest that emission and perception rely on separate genetic control. we have identified a drosophila melanogaster gene, desat1, that is involved in both the emission and the perception of sex pheromones. to explore the mechanism whereby these two aspects of communication interact, we investigated the relationship between the molecular structure, tissue-specific expression, and pheromonal phenotypes of desat1. we characterized the five desat1 transcripts-all of which yielded the same desaturase protein-and constructed transgenes with the different desat1 putative regulatory regions. each region was used to target reporter transgenes with either (i) the fluorescent gfp marker to reveal desat1 tissue expression, or (ii) the desat1 rnai sequence to determine the effects of genetic down-regulation on pheromonal phenotypes. we found that desat1 is expressed in a variety of neural and nonneural tissues, most of which are involved in reproductive functions. our results suggest that distinct desat1 putative regulatory regions independently drive the expression in nonneural and in neural cells, such that the emission and perception of sex pheromones are precisely coordinated in this species.

background: cis-regulatory modules are bound by transcription factors to regulate gene expression. characterizing these dna sequences is central to understanding gene regulatory networks and gaining insight into mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, but genome-scale regulatory module discovery remains a challenge. one popular approach is to scan the genome for clusters of transcription factor binding sites, especially those conserved in related species. when such approaches are successful, it is typically assumed that the activity of the modules is mediated by the identified binding sites and their cognate transcription factors. however, the validity of this assumption is often not assessed. results: we successfully predicted five new cis-regulatory modules by combining binding site identification with sequence conservation and compared these to unsuccessful predictions from a related approach not utilizing sequence conservation. despite greatly improved predictive success, the positive set had similar degrees of sequence and binding site conservation as the negative set. we explored the reasons for this by mutagenizing putative binding sites in three cis-regulatory modules. a large proportion of the tested sites had little or no demonstrable role in mediating regulatory element activity. examination of loss-of-function mutants also showed that some transcription factors supposedly binding to the modules are not required for their function. conclusions: our results raise important questions about interpreting regulatory module predictions obtained by finding clusters of conserved binding sites. attribution of function to these sites and their cognate transcription factors may be incorrect even when modules are successfully identified. our study underscores the importance of empirical validation of computational results even when these results are in line with expectation.

background: phylogenetic footprinting has revealed that cis-regulatory enhancers consist of conserved dna sequence clusters (cscs). currently, there is no systematic approach for enhancer discovery and analysis that takes full-advantage of the sequence information within enhancer cscs. results: we have generated a drosophila genome-wide database of conserved dna consisting of >100,000 cscs derived from evoprints spanning over 90% of the genome. cis-decoder database search and alignment algorithms enable the discovery of functionally related enhancers. the program first identifies conserved repeat elements within an input enhancer and then searches the database for cscs that score highly against the input csc. scoring is based on shared repeats as well as uniquely shared matches, and includes measures of the balance of shared elements, a diagnostic that has proven to be useful in predicting cis-regulatory function. to demonstrate the utility of these tools, a temporally-restricted cns neuroblast enhancer was used to identify other functionally related enhancers and analyze their structural organization. conclusions: cis-decoder reveals that co-regulating enhancers consist of combinations of overlapping shared sequence elements, providing insights into the mode of integration of multiple regulating transcription factors. the database and accompanying algorithms should prove useful in the discovery and analysis of enhancers involved in any developmental process.

in order to investigate regulation and redundancy within the sloppy paired (slp) locus, we analyzed 30 kilobases of dna encompassing the tandem, coordinately regulated slp1 and slp2 transcription units. we found a remarkable array of stripe enhancers with overlapping activities surrounding the slp1 transcription unit, and, unexpectedly, glial cell enhancers surrounding slp2. the slp stripe regulatory region generates 7 stripes at blastoderm, and later 14 stripes that persist throughout embryogenesis. phylogenetic analysis among drosophilids suggests that the multiplicity of stripe enhancers did not evolve through recent duplication. most of the direct integration among cis-regulatory modules appears to be simply additive, with one notable exception. despite the apparent redundancy among stripe enhancers, transgenic rescue suggests that most are required for full function, to maintain wingless expression and parasegment boundaries throughout embryogenesis. transgenic rescue also reveals indirect positive autoregulation by the 7 early stripes, without which alternate stripes within the 14-stripe pattern are lost, leading to embryos with a pair-rule phenotype.

chromatin modifications are associated with many aspects of gene expression, yet their role in cellular transitions during development remains elusive. here, we use a new approach to obtain cell type-specific information on chromatin state and rna polymerase ii (pol ii) occupancy within the multicellular drosophila melanogaster embryo. we directly assessed the relationship between chromatin modifications and the spatio-temporal activity of enhancers. rather than having a unique chromatin state, active developmental enhancers show heterogeneous histone modifications and pol ii occupancy. despite this complexity, combined chromatin signatures and pol ii presence are sufficient to predict enhancer activity de novo. pol ii recruitment is highly predictive of the timing of enhancer activity and seems dependent on the timing and location of transcription factor binding. chromatin modifications typically demarcate large regulatory regions encompassing multiple enhancers, whereas local changes in nucleosome positioning and pol ii occupancy delineate single active enhancers. this cell type-specific view identifies dynamic enhancer usage, an essential step in deciphering developmental networks.

the capa peptide receptor, capar (cg14575), is a g-protein coupled receptor (gpcr) for the d. melanogaster capa neuropeptides, drm-capa-1 and -2 (capa-1 and -2). to date, the capa peptide family constitutes the only known nitridergic peptides in insects, so the mechanisms and physiological function of ligand-receptor signalling of this peptide family are of interest. capa peptide induces calcium signaling via capar with ec₅₀ values for capa-1 = 3.06 nm and capa-2 = 4.32 nm. capar undergoes rapid desensitization, with internalization via a b-arrestin-2 mediated mechanism but is rapidly re-sensitized in the absence of capa-1. drosophila capa peptides have a c-terminal -fprxamide motif and insect-prxamide peptides are evolutionarily related to vertebrate peptide neuromedinu (nmu). potential agonist effects of human nmu-25 and the insect -prlamides [drosophila pyrokinins drm-pk-1 (capa-3), drm-pk-2 and hugin-gamma [hugg]] against capar were investigated. nmu-25, but not hugg nor drm-pk-2, increases intracellular calcium ([ca²⁺]i) levels via capar. in vivo, nmu-25 increases [ca²⁺]i and fluid transport by the drosophila malpighian (renal) tubule. ectopic expression of human nmu receptor 2 in tubules of transgenic flies results in increased [ca²⁺]i and fluid transport. finally, anti-porcine nmu-8 staining of larval cns shows that the most highly immunoreactive cells are capa-producing neurons. these structural and functional data suggest that vertebrate nmu is a putative functional homolog of drm-capa-1 and -2. capar is almost exclusively expressed in tubule principal cells; cell-specific targeted capar rnai significantly reduces capa-1 stimulated [ca²⁺]i and fluid transport. adult capar rnai transgenic flies also display resistance to desiccation. thus, capar acts in the key fluid-transporting tissue to regulate responses to desiccation stress in the fly.

myc is a crucial regulator of growth and proliferation during animal development. many signals and transcription factors lead to changes in the expression levels of drosophila myc, yet no clear model exists to explain the complexity of its regulation at the level of transcription. in this study we used drosophila genetic tools to track the dmyc cis-regulatory elements. bioinformatics analyses identified conserved sequence blocks in the noncoding regions of the dmyc gene. investigation of lacz reporter activity driven by upstream, downstream, and intronic sequences of the dmyc gene in embryonic, larval imaginal discs, larval brain, and adult ovaries, revealed that it is likely to be transcribed from multiple transcription initiation units including a far upstream regulatory region, a tata box containing proximal complex and a tata-less downstream promoter element in conjunction with an initiator within the intron 2 region. our data provide evidence for a modular organization of dmyc regulatory sequences; these modules will most likely be required to generate the tissue-specific patterns of dmyc transcripts. the far upstream region is active in late embryogenesis, while activity of other cis elements is evident during embryogenesis, in specific larval imaginal tissues and during oogenesis. these data provide a framework for further investigation of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of dmyc.

"cell fate decisions are driven through the integration of inductive signals and tissue-specific transcription factors (tfs), although the details on how this information converges in cis remain unclear. here, we demonstrate that the five genetic components essential for cardiac specification in drosophila, including the effectors of wg and dpp signaling, act as a collective unit to cooperatively regulate heart enhancer activity, both in vivo and in vitro. their combinatorial binding does not require any specific motif orientation or spacing, suggesting an alternative mode of enhancer function whereby cooperative activity occurs with extensive motif flexibility. a fraction of enhancers co-occupied by cardiogenic tfs had unexpected activity in the neighboring visceral mesoderm but could be rendered active in heart through single-site mutations. given that cardiac and visceral cells are both derived from the dorsal mesoderm, this ""dormant"" tf binding signature may represent a molecular footprint of these cells' developmental lineage."

epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) controls a wide range of developmental events, from body axes specification in insects to cardiac development in humans. during drosophila oogenesis, a gradient of egfr activation patterns the follicular epithelium. multiple transcriptional targets of egfr in this tissue have been identified, but their regulatory elements are essentially unknown. we report the regulatory elements of broad (br) and pipe (pip), two important targets of egfr signaling in drosophila oogenesis. br is expressed in a complex pattern that prefigures the formation of respiratory eggshell appendages. we found that this pattern is generated by dynamic activities of two regulatory elements, which display different responses to pointed, capicua, and mirror, transcription factors involved in the egfr-mediated gene expression. one of these elements is active in a pattern similar to pip, a gene repressed by egfr and essential for establishing the dorsoventral polarity of the embryo. we demonstrate that this similarity of expression depends on a common sequence motif that binds mirror in vitro and is essential for transcriptional repression in vivo.

the drosophila jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) gene basket (bsk) promoter contains a dna replication-related element (dre)-like sequence, raising the possibility of regulation by the dna replication-related element-binding factor (dref). chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti-dref igg showed the bsk gene promoter region to be effectively amplified. luciferase transient expression assays revealed the dre-like sequence to be important for bsk gene promoter activity, and knockdown of dref decreased the bsk mrna level and the bsk gene promoter activity. furthermore, knockdown of dref in the notum compartment of wing discs by pannier-gal4 and uas-drefir resulted in a split thorax phenotype. monitoring of jnk activity in the wing disc by lacz expression in a puckered (puc)-lacz enhancer trap line revealed the reduction in dref knockdown clones. these findings indicate that dref is involved in regulation of drosophila thorax development via actions on the jnk pathway.

members of the t-box gene family of transcription factors are important players in regulatory circuits that generate myogenic and cardiogenic lineage diversities in vertebrates. we show that during somatic myogenesis in drosophila, the single ortholog of vertebrate tbx1, optomotor-blind-related-gene-1 (org-1), is expressed in a small subset of muscle progenitors, founder cells and adult muscle precursors, where it overlaps with the products of the muscle identity genes ladybird (lb) and slouch (slou). in addition, org-1 is expressed in the lineage of the heart-associated alary muscles. org-1 null mutant embryos lack lb and slou expression within the muscle lineages that normally co-express org-1. as a consequence, the respective muscle fibers and adult muscle precursors are either severely malformed or missing, as are the alary muscles. to address the mechanisms that mediate these regulatory interactions between org-1, lb and slou, we characterized distinct enhancers associated with somatic muscle expression of lb and slou. we demonstrate that these lineage- and stage-specific cis-regulatory modules (crms) bind org-1 in vivo, respond to org-1 genetically and require t-box domain binding sites for their activation. in summary, we propose that org-1 is a common and direct upstream regulator of slou and lb in the developmental pathway of these two neighboring muscle lineages. cross-repression between slou and lb and combinatorial activation of lineage-specific targets by org-1-slou and org-1-lb, respectively, then leads to the distinction between the two lineages. these findings provide new insights into the regulatory circuits that control the proper pattering of the larval somatic musculature in drosophila.

how the brain translates changes in internal metabolic state or perceived food quality into alterations in feeding behavior remains poorly understood. studies in drosophila larvae have yielded information about neuropeptides and circuits that promote feeding, but a peptidergic neuron subset whose activation inhibits feeding in adult flies, without promoting metabolic changes that mimic the state of satiety, has not been identified. using genetically based manipulations of neuronal activity, we show that activation of neurons (or neuroendocrine cells) expressing the neuropeptide allatostatin a (asta) inhibits or limits several starvation-induced changes in feeding behavior in adult drosophila, including increased food intake and enhanced behavioral responsiveness to sugar. importantly, these effects on feeding behavior are observed in the absence of any measurable effects on metabolism or energy reserves, suggesting that asta neuron activation is likely a consequence, not a cause, of metabolic changes that induce the state of satiety. these data suggest that activation of asta-expressing neurons promotes food aversion and/or exerts an inhibitory influence on the motivation to feed and implicate these neurons and their associated circuitry in the mechanisms that translate the state of satiety into alterations in feeding behavior.

specialized somatosensory neurons detect temperatures ranging from pleasantly cool or warm to burning hot and painful (nociceptive). the precise temperature ranges sensed by thermally sensitive neurons is determined by tissue-specific expression of ion channels of the transient receptor potential(trp) family.we show here that in drosophila, trpa1 is required for the sensing of nociceptive heat. we identify two previously unidentified protein isoforms of dtrpa1, named dtrpa1-c and dtrpa1-d, that explain this requirement. a dtrpa1-c/d reporter was exclusively expressed in nociceptors, and dtrpa1-c rescued thermal nociception phenotypes when restored to mutant nociceptors. however,surprisingly, we find that dtrpa1-c is not a direct heat sensor. alternative splicing generates at least four isoforms of dtrpa1. our analysis of these isoforms reveals a 37-amino-acid-long intracellular region (encoded by a single exon) that is critical for dtrpa1 temperature responses. the identification of these amino acids opens the door to a biophysical understanding of a molecular thermosensor.

the giant drosophila protocadherin fat (ft) affects planar cell polarity (pcp). ft also inhibits the overgrowth of imaginal discs via the hippo pathway, repressing the activity of the transcription co-factor yorkie (yki). much of ft activity is likely to be mediated by its intracellular domain (ft icd). however, the links between the ft icd and either pcp or hippo activity are poorly understood, and the role of the hippo pathway in pcp is ambiguous. we have performed a structure-function analysis of the ft icd. we found that the effects of the ft icd on pcp and the hippo pathway are largely separable. surprisingly, the domains required for pcp and hippo activities do not map to any of the previously identified protein interaction domains, nor, with one exception, to the regions that are highly conserved in mammalian fat4. we also found that the extracellular domain of ft can act independently of the ft icd in pcp and can trigger dominant-negative and boundary effects on hippo activity, probably via binding to the protocadherin dachsous.

transcriptional enhancers integrate the contributions of multiple classes of transcription factors (tfs) to orchestrate the myriad spatio-temporal gene expression programs that occur during development. a molecular understanding of enhancers with similar activities requires the identification of both their unique and their shared sequence features. to address this problem, we combined phylogenetic profiling with a dna-based enhancer sequence classifier that analyzes the tf binding sites (tfbss) governing the transcription of a co-expressed gene set. we first assembled a small number of enhancers that are active in drosophila melanogaster muscle founder cells (fcs) and other mesodermal cell types. using phylogenetic profiling, we increased the number of enhancers by incorporating orthologous but divergent sequences from other drosophila species. functional assays revealed that the diverged enhancer orthologs were active in largely similar patterns as their d. melanogaster counterparts, although there was extensive evolutionary shuffling of known tfbss. we then built and trained a classifier using this enhancer set and identified additional related enhancers based on the presence or absence of known and putative tfbss. predicted fc enhancers were over-represented in proximity to known fc genes; and many of the tfbss learned by the classifier were found to be critical for enhancer activity, including pou homeodomain, myb, ets, forkhead, and t-box motifs. empirical testing also revealed that the t-box tf encoded by org-1 is a previously uncharacterized regulator of muscle cell identity. finally, we found extensive diversity in the composition of tfbss within known fc enhancers, suggesting that motif combinatorics plays an essential role in the cellular specificity exhibited by such enhancers. in summary, machine learning combined with evolutionary sequence analysis is useful for recognizing novel tfbss and for facilitating the identification of cognate tfs that coordinate cell type-specific developmental gene expression patterns.

the mechanism that specifies olfactory sensory neurons to express only one odorant receptor (or) from a large repertoire is critical for odor discrimination but poorly understood. here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of or expression regulation in drosophila. a systematic, rnai-mediated knock down of most of the predicted transcription factors identified an essential function of acj6, e93, fer1, onecut, sim, xbp1, and zf30c in the regulation of more than 30 ors. these regulatory factors are differentially expressed in antennal sensory neuron classes and specifically required for the adult expression of ors. a systematic analysis reveals not only that combinations of these seven factors are necessary for receptor gene expression but also a prominent role for transcriptional repression in preventing ectopic receptor expression. such regulation is supported by bioinformatics and or promoter analyses, which uncovered a common promoter structure with distal repressive and proximal activating regions. thus, our data provide insight into how combinatorial activation and repression can allow a small number of transcription factors to specify a large repertoire of neuron classes in the olfactory system.

centriole-to-basal body conversion, a complex process essential for ciliogenesis, involves the progressive addition of specific proteins to centrioles. chibby (cby) is a coiled-coil domain protein first described as interacting with β-catenin and involved in wg-int (wnt) signaling. we found that, in drosophila melanogaster, cby was exclusively expressed in cells that require functional basal bodies, i.e., sensory neurons and male germ cells. cby was associated with the basal body transition zone (tz) in these two cell types. inactivation of cby led to defects in sensory transduction and in spermatogenesis. loss of cby resulted in altered ciliary trafficking into neuronal cilia, irregular deposition of proteins on spermatocyte basal bodies, and, consequently, distorted axonemal assembly. importantly, cby(1/1) flies did not show wingless signaling defects. hence, cby is essential for normal basal body structure and function in drosophila, potentially through effects on the tz. the function of cby in wnt signaling in vertebrates has either been acquired during vertebrate evolution or lost in drosophila.

pattern formation in the developing embryo relies on key regulatory molecules, many of which are distributed in concentration gradients. for example, a gradient of bmp specifies cell fates along the dorsoventral axis in species ranging from flies to mammals. in drosophila, a gradient of the bmp molecule dpp gives rise to nested domains of target gene expression in the dorsal region of the embryo; however, the mechanisms underlying the differential response are not well understood, partly owing to an insufficient number of well-studied targets. here we analyze how the dpp gradient regulates expression of pannier (pnr), a candidate low-level dpp target gene. we predicted that the pnr enhancer would contain high-affinity binding sites for the dpp effector smad transcription factors, which would be occupied in the presence of low-level dpp. unexpectedly, the affinity of smad sites in the pnr enhancer was similar to those in the race enhancer, a high-level dpp target gene, suggesting that the affinity threshold mechanism plays a minimal role in the regulation of pnr. our results indicate that a mechanism involving a conserved bipartite motif that is predicted to bind a homeodomain factor in addition to smads and the brinker repressor, establishes the pnr expression domain. furthermore, the pnr enhancer has a highly complex structure that integrates cues not only from the dorsoventral axis, but also from the anteroposterior and terminal patterning systems in the blastoderm embryo.

the regulation of gene expression is mediated at the transcriptional level by enhancer regions that are bound by sequence-specific transcription factors (tfs). recent studies have shown that the in vivo binding sites of single tfs differ between developmental or cellular contexts. how this context-specific binding is encoded in the cis-regulatory dna sequence has, however, remained unclear. we computationally dissect context-specific tf binding sites in drosophila, caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human and find distinct combinations of sequence motifs for partner factors, which are predictive and reveal specific motif requirements of individual binding sites. we predict that tf binding in the early drosophila embryo depends on motifs for the early zygotic tfs vielfaltig (also known as zelda) and tramtrack. we validate experimentally that the activity of twist-bound enhancers and twist binding itself depend on vielfaltig motifs, suggesting that vielfaltig is more generally important for early transcription. our finding that the motif content can predict context-specific binding and that the predictions work across different drosophila species suggests that characteristic motif combinations are shared between sites, revealing context-specific motif codes (cis-regulatory signatures), which appear to be conserved during evolution. taken together, this study establishes a novel approach to derive predictive cis-regulatory motif requirements for individual tf binding sites and enhancers. importantly, the method is generally applicable across different cell types and organisms to elucidate cis-regulatory sequence determinants and the corresponding trans-acting factors from the increasing number of tissue- and cell-type-specific tf binding studies.

the drosophila zelda transcription factor plays an important role in regulating transcription at the embryonic maternal-to-zygotic transition. however, expression of zelda continues throughout embryogenesis in cells including the developing cns and trachea, but little is known about its post-blastoderm functions. in this paper, it is shown that zelda directly controls cns midline and tracheal expression of the link (cg13333) gene, as well as link blastoderm expression. the link gene contains a 5' enhancer with multiple zelda tagteam binding sites that in vivo mutational studies show are required for link transcription. the link enhancer also has a binding site for the single-minded:tango and trachealess:tango bhlh-pas proteins that also influences link midline and tracheal expression. these results provide an example of how a transcription factor (single-minded or trachealess) can interact with distinct co-regulatory proteins (zelda or sox/pou-homeodomain proteins) to control a similar pattern of expression of different target genes in a mechanistically different manner. while zelda and single-minded midline expression is well-conserved in drosophila, midline expression of link is not well-conserved. phylogenetic analysis of link expression suggests that ~60 million years ago, midline expression was nearly or completely absent, and first appeared in the melanogaster group (including d. melanogaster, d. yakuba, and d. erecta) >13 million years ago. the differences in expression are due, in part, to sequence polymorphisms in the link enhancer and likely due to altered binding of multiple transcription factors. less than 6 million years ago, a second change occurred that resulted in high levels of expression in d. melanogaster. this change may be due to alterations in a putative zelda binding site. within the cns, the zelda gene is alternatively spliced beginning at mid-embryogenesis into transcripts that encode a zelda isoform missing three zinc fingers from the dna binding domain. this may result in a protein with altered, possibly non-functional, dna-binding properties. in summary, zelda collaborates with bhlh-pas proteins to directly regulate midline and tracheal expression of an evolutionary dynamic enhancer in the post-blastoderm embryo.

the homeodomain (hd) protein bicoid (bcd) is thought to function as a gradient morphogen that positions boundaries of target genes via threshold-dependent activation mechanisms. here, we analyze 66 bcd-dependent regulatory elements and show that their boundaries are positioned primarily by repressive gradients that antagonize bcd-mediated activation. a major repressor is the pair-rule protein runt (run), which is expressed in an opposing gradient and is necessary and sufficient for limiting bcd-dependent activation. evidence is presented that run functions with the maternal repressor capicua and the gap protein kruppel as the principal components of a repression system that correctly orders boundaries throughout the anterior half of the embryo. these results put conceptual limits on the bcd morphogen hypothesis and demonstrate how the bcd gradient functions within the gene network that patterns the embryo.

neurons present a wide variety of morphologies that are associated with their specialized functions. however, to date very few pathways and factors regulating neuronal maturation, including morphogenesis, have been identified. to address this issue we make use here of the genetically amenable developing fly photoreceptor (pr). whereas this sensory neuron is specified early during retinal development, its maturation spans several days. during this time, this neuron acquires specialized membrane domains while undergoing extensive polarity remodeling. in this study, we identify a pathway in which the conserved homeobox protein orthodenticle (otd) acts together with the ecdysone receptor (ecr) to directly repress the expression of the transcription factor (tf) kruppel homolog 1 (kr-h1). we demonstrate that this pathway is not required to promote neuronal specification but is crucial to regulate pr maturation. pr maturation includes the remodeling of the cell's epithelial features and associated apical membrane morphogenesis. furthermore, we show that hormonal control coordinates pr differentiation and morphogenesis with overall development. this study demonstrates that during pr differentiation, transient repression of kr-h1 represents a key step regulating neuronal maturation. down-regulation of kr-h1 expression has been previously associated with instances of neuronal remodeling in the fly brain. we therefore conclude that repression of this transcription factor represents a key step, enabling remodeling and maturation in a wide variety of neurons.

fascin is an evolutionarily conserved actin-binding protein that plays a key role in forming filopodia. it is widely thought that this function involves fascin directly bundling actin filaments, which is controlled by an n-terminal regulatory serine residue. in this paper, by studying cellular processes in drosophila melanogaster that require fascin activity, we identify a regulatory residue within the c-terminal region of the protein (s289). unexpectedly, although mutation (s289a) of this residue disrupted the actin-bundling capacity of fascin, fascin s289a fully rescued filopodia formation in fascin mutant flies. live imaging of migrating macrophages in vivo revealed that this mutation restricted the localization of fascin to the distal ends of filopodia. the corresponding mutation of human fascin (s274) similarly affected its interaction with actin and altered filopodia dynamics within carcinoma cells. these data reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for this regulatory region and unveil a function for fascin, uncoupled from actin bundling, at the distal end of filopodia.

the elaborate courtship ritual of drosophila males is dictated by neural circuitry established by the transcription factor fruitless and triggered by sex-specific sensory cues. deciphering the role of different stimuli in driving courtship behavior has been limited by the inability to selectively target appropriate sensory classes. here, we identify two ion channel genes belonging to the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel/pickpocket (ppk) family, ppk23 and ppk29, which are expressed in fruitless-positive neurons on the legs and are essential for courtship. gene loss-of-function, cell-inactivation, and cell-activation experiments demonstrate that these genes and neurons are necessary and sufficient to inhibit courtship toward males and promote courtship toward females. moreover, these cells respond to cuticular hydrocarbons, with different cells selectively responding to male or female pheromones. these studies identify a large population of pheromone-sensing neurons and demonstrate the essential role of contact chemosensation in the early courtship steps of mate selection and courtship initiation.

in the developing cns, unique functional identities among neurons and glia are, in part, established as a result of successive transitions in gene expression programs within neural precursor cells. one of the temporal-identity windows within drosophila cns neural precursor cells or neuroblasts (nbs) is marked by the expression of a zinc-finger transcription factor (tf) gene, castor (cas). our analysis of cis-regulatory dna within a cas loss-of-function rescue fragment has identified seven enhancers that independently activate reporter transgene expression in specific sub-patterns of the wild-type embryonic cas gene expression domain. most of these enhancers also regulate different aspects of cas expression within the larval and adult cns. phylogenetic footprinting reveals that each enhancer is made up of clusters of highly conserved dna sequence blocks that are flanked by less-conserved inter-cluster spacer sequences. comparative analysis of the conserved dna also reveals that cas enhancers share different combinations of sequence elements and many of these shared elements contain core dna-binding recognition motifs for characterized temporal-identity tfs. intra-species alignments show that two of the sub-pattern enhancers originated from an inverted duplication and that this repeat is unique to the cas locus in all sequenced drosophila species. finally we show that three of the enhancers differentially require cas function for their wild-type regulatory behavior. cas limits the expression of one enhancer while two others require cas function for full expression. these studies represent a starting point for the further analysis of cas gene expression and the tfs that regulate it.

females of many animal species emit chemical signals that attract and arouse males for mating. for example, the major aphrodisiac pheromone of drosophila melanogaster females, 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11-hd), is a potent inducer of male-specific courtship and copulatory behaviors. here, we demonstrate that a set of gustatory sensory neurons on the male foreleg, defined by expression of the ppk23 marker, respond to 7,11-hd. activity of these neurons is required for males to robustly court females or to court males perfumed with 7,11-hd. artificial activation of these ppk23(+) neurons stimulates male-male courtship even without 7,11-hd perfuming. these data identify the ppk23(+) sensory neurons as the primary targets for female sex pheromones in drosophila.

the lim-homeodomain transcription factor tailup/islet1 (tup) is a key component of cardiogenesis in drosophila and vertebrates. we report here an additional major role for drosophila tup in specifying dorsal muscles. tup is expressed in the four dorsal muscle progenitors (pcs) and tup-null embryos display a severely disorganized dorsal musculature, including a transformation of the dorsal da2 into dorsolateral da3 muscle. this transformation is reciprocal to the da3 to da2 transformation observed in collier (col) mutants. the da2 pc, which gives rise to the da2 muscle and to an adult muscle precursor, is selected from a cluster of myoblasts transiently expressing both tinman (tin) and col. the activation of tup by tin in the da2 pc is required to repress col transcription and establish da2 identity. the transient, partial overlap between tin and col expression provides a window of opportunity to distinguish between da2 and da3 muscle identities. the function of tup in the da2 pc illustrates how single cell precision can be reached in cell specification when temporal dynamics are combined with positional information. the contributions of tin, tup and col to patterning drosophila dorsal muscles bring novel parallels with chordate pharyngeal muscle development.

we established a collection of 7,000 transgenic lines of drosophila melanogaster. expression of gal4 in each line is controlled by a different, defined fragment of genomic dna that serves as a transcriptional enhancer. we used confocal microscopy of dissected nervous systems to determine the expression patterns driven by each fragment in the adult brain and ventral nerve cord. we present image data on 6,650 lines. using both manual and machine-assisted annotation, we describe the expression patterns in the most useful lines. we illustrate the utility of these data for identifying novel neuronal cell types, revealing brain asymmetry, and describing the nature and extent of neuronal shape stereotypy. the gal4 lines allow expression of exogenous genes in distinct, small subsets of the adult nervous system. the set of dna fragments, each driving a documented expression pattern, will facilitate the generation of additional constructs for manipulating neuronal function.

the identification of transcription factor binding sites, enhancers, and transcriptional target genes often relies on the integration of gene expression profiling and computational cis-regulatory sequence analysis. methods for the prediction of cis-regulatory elements can take advantage of comparative genomics to increase signal-to-noise levels. however, gene expression data are usually derived from only one species. here we investigate tissue-specific cross-species gene expression profiling by high-throughput sequencing, combined with cross-species motif discovery. first, we compared different methods for expression level quantification and cross-species integration using tag-seq data. using the optimal pipeline, we derived a set of genes with conserved expression during retinal determination across drosophila melanogaster, drosophila yakuba, and drosophila virilis. these genes are enriched for binding sites of eye-related transcription factors including the zinc-finger glass, a master regulator of photoreceptor differentiation. validation of predicted glass targets using rna-seq in homozygous glass mutants confirms that the majority of our predictions are expressed downstream from glass. finally, we tested nine candidate enhancers by in vivo reporter assays and found eight of them to drive gfp in the eye disc, of which seven colocalize with the glass protein, namely, scrt, chp, dpr10, cg6329, retn, lim3, and dmrt99b. in conclusion, we show for the first time the combined use of cross-species expression profiling with cross-species motif discovery as a method to define a core developmental program, and we augment the candidate glass targetome from a single known target gene, lozenge, to at least 62 conserved transcriptional targets.

single-minded (sim) is a master regulatory gene that directs differentiation in the central nervous system during drosophila embryogenesis. recent identification of the mesectoderm enhancer (mse) of sim has led to the hypothesis that two snail (sna)-binding sites in the mse may repress sim expression in the presumptive mesoderm. we provide evidence here that three sna-binding sites proximal to the sim promoter, but not those of the mse, are responsible for the mesodermal repression of sim in vivo. using transgenic embryos injected with lacz transgenes, we showed that sim repression in the mesoderm requires the three promoter-proximal sna-binding sites. these results suggest that sna represses the mesectodermal expression of sim by directly repressing the nearby promoter, and not by quenching adjacent transcriptional activators in the mse. these data also showed how the mse, lacking the three proximal sna-binding sites, reproduced the endogenous pattern of sim expression in transgenic embryos.

"activation of the gap gene hunchback (hb) by the maternal bicoid gradient is one of the most intensively studied gene regulatory interactions in animal development. most efforts to understand this process have focused on the classical bicoid target enhancer located immediately upstream of the p2 promoter. however, hb is also regulated by a recently identified distal shadow enhancer as well as a neglected ""stripe"" enhancer, which mediates expression in both central and posterior regions of cellularizing embryos. here, we employ bac transgenesis and quantitative imaging methods to investigate the individual contributions of these different enhancers to the dynamic hb expression pattern. these studies reveal that the stripe enhancer is crucial for establishing the definitive border of the anterior hb expression pattern, just beyond the initial border delineated by bicoid. removal of this enhancer impairs dynamic expansion of hb expression and results in variable cuticular defects in the mesothorax (t2) due to abnormal patterns of segmentation gene expression. the stripe enhancer is subject to extensive regulation by gap repressors, including kruppel, knirps, and hb itself. we propose that this repression helps ensure precision of the anterior hb border in response to variations in the bicoid gradient."

contemporary high-throughput technologies permit the rapid identification of transcription factor (tf) target genes on a genome-wide scale, yet the functional significance of tfs requires knowledge of target gene expression patterns, cooperating tfs, and cis-regulatory element (cre) structures. here we investigated the myogenic regulatory network downstream of the drosophila zinc finger tf lame duck (lmd) by combining both previously published and newly performed genomic data sets, including chip sequencing (chip-seq), genome-wide mrna profiling, cell-specific expression patterns of putative transcriptional targets, analysis of histone mark signatures, studies of tf cooccupancy by additional mesodermal regulators, tf binding site determination using protein binding microarrays (pbms), and machine learning of candidate cre motif compositions. our findings suggest that lmd orchestrates an extensive myogenic regulatory network, a conclusion supported by the identification of lmd-dependent genes, histone signatures of lmd-bound genomic regions, and the relationship of these features to cell-specific gene expression patterns. the heterogeneous cooccupancy of lmd-bound regions with additional mesodermal regulators revealed that different transcriptional inputs are used to mediate similar myogenic gene expression patterns. machine learning further demonstrated diverse combinatorial motif patterns within tissue-specific lmd-bound regions. pbm analysis established the complete spectrum of lmd dna binding specificities, and site-directed mutagenesis of lmd and additional newly discovered motifs in known enhancers demonstrated the critical role of these tf binding sites in supporting full enhancer activity. collectively, these findings provide insights into the transcriptional codes regulating muscle gene expression and offer a generalizable approach for similar studies in other systems.

adh distal factor-1 (adf-1) is a sequence-specific dna-binding activity originally identified in drosophila tissue culture cells and embryos. adf-1 binds to upstream recognition elements in each of the two promoters of the drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adh), and binding of adf-1 to the adh distal promoter site activates transcription. we have carried out a mutational analysis of the adh distal promoter using both an in vitro transcription assay and a transient transfection assay in drosophila tissue culture cells, and in both cases find that deletion of sequences required for adf-1 binding leads to a 3-4-fold drop in transcription. we have purified adf-1 and demonstrate by a sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel renaturation assay that it is a 34-kda protein. purified adf-1 activates adh distal promoter transcription in vitro in a binding site-dependent manner. dnase i footprint analysis shows that the purified protein binds not only to the two previously characterized sites in adh but also to transcriptional regulatory elements in the dopa decarboxylase (ddc) and antennapedia (antp) p1 promoters. thus, it appears that adf-1 may play an important role not only in the regulation of adh expression but also in the transcription of other drosophila genes as well.

by a conserved cellular differentiation process, spermatogenesis leads to formation of haploid sperm for successful reproduction. in drosophila and in mammals, post-meiotic spermatid differentiation depends on several translationally repressed and stored mrnas that are often expressed exclusively in the testis through a cell type specific transcriptional program. in drosophila, the mrnas of proteins required for post-meiotic chromatin reorganisation, like protb and mst77f, are transcribed in meiotic spermatocytes and subjected to translational repression for days. transcription of many of these translationally repressed mrnas depends on testis-specific homologs of tata box binding protein-associated factors (ttafs). here, we identified the testis-specific bromodomain protein, tbrd-1, that is only expressed in primary spermatocytes. bromodomain proteins are able to recognise and bind acetylated histones and non-histone proteins. we generated tbrd-1 mutant flies and observed that function of tbrd-1 is required for male fertility. tbrd-1 partially colocalised with ttafs, taf1 and polycomb to a fibrillarin-deficient region within the spermatocyte nucleolus. the nucleolar localisation of tbrd-1 depended on ttaf function but not the other way round. further, we could show that ectopically expressed tbrd-1-egfp is able to bind to the interbands of polytene chromosomes. by inhibitor treatment of cultured testis we observed that sub-cellular localisation of tbrd-1 may depend on the acetylation status of primary spermatocytes.

the outcome of the notch pathway on proliferation depends on cellular context, being growth promotion in some, including several cancers, and growth inhibition in others. such disparate outcomes are evident in drosophila wing discs, where notch overactivation causes hyperplasia despite having localized inhibitory effects on proliferation. to understand the underlying mechanisms, we have used genomic strategies to identify the notch-csl target genes directly activated during wing disc hyperplasia. among them were genes involved in both autonomous and non-autonomous regulation of proliferation, growth and cell death, providing molecular explanations for many characteristics of notch induced wing disc hyperplasia previously reported. the notch targets exhibit different response patterns, which are shaped by both positive and negative feed-forward regulation between the notch targets themselves. we propose, therefore, that both the characteristics of the direct notch targets and their cross-regulatory relationships are important in coordinating the pattern of hyperplasia.

in animals, each sequence-specific transcription factor typically binds to thousands of genomic regions in vivo. our previous studies of 20 transcription factors show that most genomic regions bound at high levels in drosophila blastoderm embryos are known or probable functional targets, but genomic regions occupied only at low levels have characteristics suggesting that most are not involved in the cis-regulation of transcription. here we use transgenic reporter gene assays to directly test the transcriptional activity of 104 genomic regions bound at different levels by the 20 transcription factors. fifteen genomic regions were selected based solely on the dna occupancy level of the transcription factor kruppel. five of the six most highly bound regions drive blastoderm patterns of reporter transcription. in contrast, only one of the nine lowly bound regions drives transcription at this stage and four of them are not detectably active at any stage of embryogenesis. a larger set of 89 genomic regions chosen using criteria designed to identify functional cis-regulatory regions supports the same trend: genomic regions occupied at high levels by transcription factors in vivo drive patterned gene expression, whereas those occupied only at lower levels mostly do not. these results support studies that indicate that the high cellular concentrations of sequence-specific transcription factors drive extensive, low-occupancy, nonfunctional interactions within the accessible portions of the genome.

the drosophila eggshell is an elaborate structure that is derived from a monolayer of follicular epithelium surrounding the developing oocyte within the female ovary. the bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling pathway is essential for controlling the patterning and morphogenesis of the eggshell. during oogenesis, the roles of patterning and morphogenesis by the bmp type i receptor thickveins (tkv) have been studied extensively. however, signaling through this pathway requires both type i and ii receptors, and the latter has yet to be established in oogenesis. we focus on wishful thinking (wit), the drosophila homolog to the mammalian bmp type ii receptor, bmprii. we found that wit is expressed dynamically in the fcs of d. melanogaster in an evolutionary conserved pattern. the expression patterns are highly correlated with the dynamics of the bmp signaling, which is consistent with our finding that wit is a target of bmp signaling. furthermore, we established that wit is necessary for bmp signaling, and loss of wit is associated with cell autonomous loss of bmp responses. of importance, we demonstrated that perturbations in wit led to changes in eggshell morphologies in domains that are patterned by bmp signaling. previous studies have shown a role for wit in bmp signaling during neurogenesis; however, our results reveal a role for wit in epithelial cells' development.

the drosophila glue gene sgs-3 is specifically expressed in the secretory cells of the salivary glands of third instar larvae. we have assayed the expression of gene fusions to determine the role of cis-acting sgs-3 sequences in conferring this pattern of expression. these experiments define two regulatory regions required for expression of reporter genes from the sgs-3 promoter. one region, between 106 and 56 bp upstream of the sgs-3 mrna 5' end is sufficient for low but correct tissue- and stage-specific expression. a second region, lying between 629 and 130 bp 5' of the rna start site is functionally equivalent; that is, it alone will also direct low level, specific expression. these two regions act synergistically to give high level expression. more distant upstream regions function to further increase levels of expression. these two regulatory elements can confer a salivary gland-specific pattern of expression on a heterologous promoter and are also sufficient to drive gene expression in other drosophila species, implying conservation of regulators.

the diverse functions of notch signalling imply that it must elicit context-specific programmes of gene expression. with the aim of investigating how notch drives cells to differentiate, we have used a genome-wide approach to identify direct notch targets in drosophila haemocytes (blood cells), where notch promotes crystal cell differentiation. many of the identified notch-regulated enhancers contain runx and gata motifs, and we demonstrate that binding of the runx protein lozenge (lz) is required for enhancers to be competent to respond to notch. functional studies of targets, such as klumpfuss (erg/wt1 family) and pebbled/hindsight (rreb1 homologue), show that notch acts both to prevent the cells adopting alternate cell fates and to promote morphological characteristics associated with crystal cell differentiation. inappropriate activity of klumpfuss perturbs the differentiation programme, resulting in melanotic tumours. thus, by acting as a master regulator, lz directs notch to activate selectively a combination of target genes that correctly locks cells into the differentiation programme.

the nk homeodomain factor tinman is a crucial regulator of early mesoderm patterning and, together with the gata factor pannier and the dorsocross t-box factors, serves as one of the key cardiogenic factors during specification and differentiation of heart cells. although the basic framework of regulatory interactions driving heart development has been worked out, only about a dozen genes involved in heart development have been designated as direct tinman target genes to date, and detailed information about the functional architectures of their cardiac enhancers is lacking. we have used immunoprecipitation of chromatin (chip) from embryos at two different stages of early cardiogenesis to obtain a global overview of the sequences bound by tinman in vivo and their linked genes. our data from the analysis of ~50 sequences with high tinman occupancy show that the majority of such sequences act as enhancers in various mesodermal tissues in which tinman is active. all of the dorsal mesodermal and cardiac enhancers, but not some of the others, require tinman function. the cardiac enhancers feature diverse arrangements of binding motifs for tinman, pannier, and dorsocross. by employing these cardiac and non-cardiac enhancers in machine learning approaches, we identify a novel motif, termed cee, as a classifier for cardiac enhancers. in vivo assays for the requirement of the binding motifs of tinman, pannier, and dorsocross, as well as the cee motifs in a set of cardiac enhancers, show that the tinman sites are essential in all but one of the tested enhancers; although on occasion they can be functionally redundant with dorsocross sites. the enhancers differ widely with respect to their requirement for pannier, dorsocross, and cee sites, which we ascribe to their different position in the regulatory circuitry, their distinct temporal and spatial activities during cardiogenesis, and functional redundancies among different factor binding sites.

genomic enhancers are important regulators of gene expression, but their identification is a challenge, and methods depend on indirect measures of activity. we developed a method termed starr-seq to directly and quantitatively assess enhancer activity for millions of candidates from arbitrary sources of dna, which enables screens across entire genomes. when applied to the drosophila genome, starr-seq identifies thousands of cell type-specific enhancers across a broad continuum of strengths, links differential gene expression to differences in enhancer activity, and creates a genome-wide quantitative enhancer map. this map reveals the highly complex regulation of transcription, with several independent enhancers for both developmental regulators and ubiquitously expressed genes. starr-seq can be used to identify and quantify enhancer activity in other eukaryotes, including humans.

extradenticle (exd) and homothorax (hth) function as positive transcriptional cofactors of hox proteins, helping them to bind specifically their direct targets. the posterior hox protein abdominal-b (abd-b) does not require exd/hth to bind dna; and, during embryogenesis, abd-b represses hth and exd transcription. here we show that this repression is necessary for abd-b function, as maintained exd/hth expression results in transformations similar to those observed in loss-of-function abd-b mutants. we characterize the cis regulatory module directly regulated by abd-b in the empty spiracles gene and show that the exd/hth complex interferes with abd-b binding to this enhancer. our results suggest that this novel exd/hth function does not require the complex to bind dna and may be mediated by direct exd/hth binding to the abd-b homeodomain. thus, in some instances, the main positive cofactor complex for anterior hox proteins can act as a negative factor for the posterior hox protein abd-b. this antagonistic interaction uncovers an alternative way in which meis and pbc cofactors can modulate abd-b like posterior hox genes during development.

insect odorant-binding proteins function in the sensing of odors, tastes, and pheromones. genes encoding two odorant-binding proteins, obp57d and obp57e, were identified to be involved in the behavioral adaptation of drosophila sechellia to its host plant. the two genes are expressed in cells associated with taste sensilla on the legs, and the expression pattern in the legs is conserved among closely related species. to identify the cis-regulatory elements necessary for the expression in the leg sensilla, the promoter sequences of obp57d and obp57e were compared among species. two types of conserved sequence-motifs were found as candidate cis-regulatory elements. functions of these conserved elements in the promoters of d. melanogaster obp57d and obp57e were examined by using a newly constructed vector that combines the advantages of φc31 integrase-based transformation and gypsy transposable-element-derived insulators. by gfp-reporter assay using the new vector, it was confirmed that these conserved elements are necessary for the expression in the legs, working synergistically with each other to affect the expression level. single-nucleotide substitutions in these elements dramatically changed the promoter activity. these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism for evolution of adaptive behavior via modulation of obp expression levels.

animals across various phyla exhibit odor-evoked innate attraction behavior that is developmentally programmed. the mechanism underlying such behavior remains unclear because the odorants that elicit robust attraction responses and the neuronal circuits that mediate this behavior have not been identified. here, we describe a functionally segregated population of olfactory sensory neurons (osns) and projection neurons (pns) in drosophila melanogaster that are highly specific to ammonia and amines, which act as potent attractants. the osns express ir92a, a member of the chemosensory ionotropic receptor (ir) family and project to a pair of glomeruli in the antennal lobe, termed vm1. in vivo calcium-imaging experiments showed that the osns and pns innervating vm1 were activated by ammonia and amines but not by nonamine odorants. flies in which the ir92a(+) neurons or ir92a gene was inactivated had impaired amine-evoked physiological and behavioral responses. tracing neuronal pathways to higher brain centers showed that vm1-pn axonal projections within the lateral horn are topographically segregated from those of v-pn and dc4-pn, which mediate innate avoidance behavior to carbon dioxide and acidity, respectively, suggesting that these sensory stimuli of opposing valence are represented in spatially distinct neuroanatomic loci within the lateral horn. these experiments identified the neurons and their cognate receptor for amine detection, and mapped amine attractive olfactory inputs to higher brain centers. this labeled-line mode of amine coding appears to be hardwired to attraction behavior.

epithelial tubes are the infrastructure for organs and tissues, and tube morphogenesis requires precise orchestration of cell signaling, shape, migration, and adhesion. follicle cells in the drosophila ovary form a pair of epithelial tubes whose lumens act as molds for the eggshell respiratory filaments, or dorsal appendages (das). da formation is a robust and accessible model for studying the patterning, formation, and expansion of epithelial tubes. tramtrack69 (ttk69), a transcription factor that exhibits a variable embryonic dna-binding preference, controls da lumen volume and shape by promoting tube expansion; the tramtrack mutation twin peaks (ttk(twk)) reduces ttk69 levels late in oogenesis, inhibiting this expansion. microarray analysis of wild-type and ttk(twk) ovaries, followed by in situ hybridization and rnai of candidate genes, identified the phospholipase b-like protein lamina ancestor (lama), the scaffold protein paxillin, the endocytotic regulator shibire (dynamin), and the homeodomain transcription factor mirror, as ttk69 effectors of da-tube expansion. these genes displayed enriched expression in da-tube cells, except lama, which was expressed in all follicle cells. all four genes showed reduced expression in ttk(twk) mutants and exhibited rnai phenotypes that were enhanced in a ttk(twk)/+ background, indicating ttk(twk) genetic interactions. although previous studies show that mirror patterns the follicular epithelium prior to da tubulogenesis, we show that mirror has an independent, novel role in tube expansion, involving positive regulation of paxillin. thus, characterization of ttk(twk)-differentially expressed genes expands the network of ttk69 effectors, identifies novel epithelial tube-expansion regulators, and significantly advances our understanding of this vital developmental process.

in insects, products of the male reproductive tract are essential for initiating and maintaining the female post-mating response (pmr). the pmr includes changes in egg laying, receptivity to courting males, and sperm storage. in drosophila, previous studies have determined that the main cells of the male accessory gland produce some of the products required for these processes. however, nothing was known about the contribution of the gland's other secretory cell type, the secondary cells. in the course of investigating the late functions of the homeotic gene, abdominal-b (abd-b), we discovered that abd-b is specifically expressed in the secondary cells of the drosophila male accessory gland. using an abd-b bac reporter coupled with a collection of genetic deletions, we discovered an enhancer from the iab-6 regulatory domain that is responsible for abd-b expression in these cells and that apparently works independently from the segmentally regulated chromatin domains of the bithorax complex. removal of this enhancer results in visible morphological defects in the secondary cells. we determined that mates of iab-6 mutant males show defects in long-term egg laying and suppression of receptivity, and that products of the secondary cells are influential during sperm competition. many of these phenotypes seem to be caused by a defect in the storage and gradual release of sex peptide in female mates of iab-6 mutant males. we also found that abd-b expression in the secondary cells contributes to glycosylation of at least three accessory gland proteins: ovulin (acp26aa), cg1656, and cg1652. our results demonstrate that long-term post-mating changes observed in mated females are not solely induced by main cell secretions, as previously believed, but that secondary cells also play an important role in male fertility by extending the female pmr. overall, these discoveries provide new insights into how these two cell types cooperate to produce and maintain a robust female pmr.

stochastic mechanisms are sometimes utilized to diversify cell fates, especially in nervous systems. in the drosophila retina, stochastic expression of the pas-bhlh transcription factor spineless (ss) controls photoreceptor subtype choice. in one randomly distributed subset of r7 photoreceptors, ss activates rhodopsin4 (rh4) and represses rhodopsin3 (rh3); counterparts lacking ss express rh3 and repress rh4. in the dorsal third region of the retina, the iroquois complex transcription factors induce rh3 in rh4-expressing r7s. here, we show that ss levels are controlled in a binary on/off manner throughout the retina yet are attenuated in the dorsal third region to allow rh3 coexpression with rh4. whereas the sensitivity of rh3 repression to differences in ss levels generates stochastic and regionalized patterns, the robustness of rh4 activation ensures its stochastic expression throughout the retina. our findings show how stochastic and regional inputs are integrated to control photoreceptor subtype specification in the drosophila retina.

analysis of cis-regulatory enhancers has revealed that they consist of clustered blocks of highly conserved sequences. although most characterized enhancers reside near their target genes, a growing number of studies have shown that enhancers located over 50 kb from their minimal promoter(s) are required for appropriate gene expression and many of these 'long-range' enhancers are found in genomic regions that are devoid of identified exons. to gain insight into the complexity of drosophila cis-regulatory sequences within exon-poor regions, we have undertaken an evolutionary analysis of 39 of these regions located throughout the genome. this survey revealed that within these genomic expanses, clusters of conserved sequence blocks (csbs) are positioned once every 1.1 kb, on average, and that a typical cluster contains multiple (5 to 30 or more) csbs that have been maintained for at least 190 my of evolutionary divergence. as an initial step toward assessing the cis-regulatory activity of conserved clusters within gene-free genomic expanses, we have tested the in-vivo enhancer activity of 19 consecutive csb clusters located in the middle of a 115 kb gene-poor region on the 3(rd) chromosome. our studies revealed that each cluster functions independently as a specific spatial/temporal enhancer. in total, the enhancers possess a diversity of regulatory functions, including dynamically activating expression in defined patterns within subsets of cells in discrete regions of the embryo, larvae and/or adult. we also observed that many of the enhancers are multifunctional-that is, they activate expression during multiple developmental stages. by extending these results to the rest of the drosophila genome, which contains over 70,000 non-coding csb clusters, we suggest that most function as enhancers.

differentiation of a specific organ or tissue requires sequential activation of regulatory genes. however, little is known about how serial gene expression is temporally regulated. here, we present evidence that differential expression of single-minded (sim) target genes can be attributed, in part, to the number of sim and tango (tgo) heterodimer binding sites within their enhancer regions. the sim, termed a master regulator, directs ventral midline differentiation of drosophila central nervous system (cns). according to data on the onset timing of ventral midline gene expression, sim target genes are classified into at least 2 groups (early and late). the sim and rhomboid (rho) genes are activated during early midline differentiation whereas orthodenticle (otd), cg10249, and slit (sli) genes undergo activation during later stages of midline differentiation. germline transformation and in situ hybridization with transgenic embryos demonstrate that enhancers activating sim and rho expression contain 4 sim-tgo binding sites whereas only 1 sim-tgo binding site is found in an enhancer of sli. a mutagenized version of the rho enhancer lacking either 1, 2, or 3 sim-tgo binding sites mediated progressively more delayed expression of a lacz reporter gene in the ventral midline. in contrast, a modified sli enhancer displayed progressively earlier onset of lacz expression when 1, 2, or 3 more sim-tgo binding sites were added. taken together, these results suggest that the number of sim-tgo-binding sites is decisive in determining the timing of gene expression in the developing ventral midline. we also discuss a combinatorial model accounting for the sequential expression of sim target genes.

most identified drosophila appendage-patterning genes encode dna-binding proteins, whose cross-regulatory interactions remain to be better characterized at the molecular level, notably by studying their direct binding to tissue-specific transcriptional enhancers. a fine-tuned spatio-temporal expression of bric-a-brac2 (bab2) along concentric rings is essential for proper proximo-distal (p-d) differentiation of legs and antennae. however, within the genetic interaction landscape governing limb development, no transcription factor directly controlling bab2 expression has been identified to date. using site-targeted gfp reporter assay and bac recombineering, we show here that restricted bab2 expression in leg and antennal imaginal discs relies on a single 567-bp-long cis-regulatory module (crm), termed lae (for leg and antennal enhancer). we show that this crm (i) is necessary and sufficient to ensure normal bab2 activity in developing leg and antenna, and (ii) is structurally and functionally conserved among drosophilidae. through deletion and site-directed mutagenesis approaches, we identified within the lae essential sequence motifs required in both leg and antennal tissues. using genetic and biochemical tests, we establish that in the lae (i) a key taat-rich activator motif interacts with the homeodomain p-d protein distal-less (dll) and (ii) a single t-rich activator motif binds the c2h2 zinc-finger p-d protein rotund (rn), leading to bab2 up-regulation respectively in all or specifically in the proximal-most ring(s), both in leg and antenna. joint ectopic expression of dll and rn is sufficient to cell-autonomously activate endogenous bab2 and lae-driven reporter expression in wing and haltere cells. our findings indicate that accuracy, reliability and robustness of developmental gene expression do not necessarily require cis-regulatory information redundancy.

transcriptional enhancers are a primary mechanism by which tissue-specific gene expression is achieved. despite the importance of these regulatory elements in development, responses to environmental stresses and disease, testing enhancer activity in animals remains tedious, with a minority of enhancers having been characterized. here we describe 'enhancer-facs-seq' (efs) for highly parallel identification of active, tissue-specific enhancers in drosophila melanogaster embryos. analysis of enhancers identified by efs as being active in mesodermal tissues revealed enriched dna binding site motifs of known and putative, previously uncharacterized mesodermal transcription factors. naive bayes classifiers using transcription factor binding site motifs accurately predicted mesodermal enhancer activity. application of efs to other cell types and organisms should accelerate the cataloging of enhancers and understanding how transcriptional regulation is encoded in them.

background: developmental programs are implemented by regulatory interactions between transcription factors (tfs) and their target genes, which remain poorly understood. while recent studies have focused on regulatory cascades of tfs that govern early development, little is known about how the ultimate effectors of cell differentiation are selected and controlled. we addressed this question during late drosophila embryogenesis, when the finely tuned expression of the tf ovo/shavenbaby (svb) triggers the morphological differentiation of epidermal trichomes. results: we defined a sizeable set of genes downstream of svb and used in vivo assays to delineate 14 enhancers driving their specific expression in trichome cells. coupling computational modeling to functional dissection, we investigated the regulatory logic of these enhancers. extending the repertoire of epidermal effectors using genome-wide approaches showed that the regulatory models learned from this first sample are representative of the whole set of trichome enhancers. these enhancers harbor remarkable features with respect to their functional architectures, including a weak or non-existent clustering of svb binding sites. the in vivo function of each site relies on its intimate context, notably the flanking nucleotides. two additional cis-regulatory motifs, present in a broad diversity of composition and positioning among trichome enhancers, critically contribute to enhancer activity. conclusions: our results show that svb directly regulates a large set of terminal effectors of the remodeling of epidermal cells. further, these data reveal that trichome formation is underpinned by unexpectedly diverse modes of regulation, providing fresh insights into the functional architecture of enhancers governing a terminal differentiation program.

the development of morphological traits occurs through the collective action of networks of genes connected at the level of gene expression. as any node in a network may be a target of evolutionary change, the recurrent targeting of the same node would indicate that the path of evolution is biased for the relevant trait and network. although examples of parallel evolution have implicated recurrent modification of the same gene and cis-regulatory element (cre), little is known about the mutational and molecular paths of parallel cre evolution. in drosophila melanogaster fruit flies, the bric-à-brac (bab) transcription factors control the development of a suite of sexually dimorphic traits on the posterior abdomen. female-specific bab expression is regulated by the dimorphic element, a cre that possesses direct inputs from body plan (abd-b) and sex-determination (dsx) transcription factors. here, we find that the recurrent evolutionary modification of this cre underlies both intraspecific and interspecific variation in female pigmentation in the melanogaster species group. by reconstructing the sequence and regulatory activity of the ancestral drosophila melanogaster dimorphic element, we demonstrate that a handful of mutations were sufficient to create independent cre alleles with differing activities. moreover, intraspecific and interspecific dimorphic element evolution proceeded with little to no alterations to the known body plan and sex-determination regulatory linkages. collectively, our findings represent an example where the paths of evolution appear biased to a specific cre, and drastic changes in function were accompanied by deep conservation of key regulatory linkages.

"the yorkie/yap transcriptional coactivator is a well-known regulator of cellular proliferation in both invertebrates and mammals. as a coactivator, yorkie (yki) lacks a dna binding domain and must partner with sequence-specific dna binding proteins in the nucleus to regulate gene expression; in drosophila, the developmental regulators scalloped (sd) and homothorax (hth) are two such partners. to determine the range of target genes regulated by these three transcription factors, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments for each factor in both the wing and eye-antenna imaginal discs. strong, tissue-specific binding patterns are observed for sd and hth, while yki binding is remarkably similar across both tissues. binding events common to the eye and wing are also present for sd and hth; these are associated with genes regulating cell proliferation and ""housekeeping"" functions, and account for the majority of yki binding. in contrast, tissue-specific binding events for sd and hth significantly overlap enhancers that are active in the given tissue, are enriched in sd and hth dna binding sites, respectively, and are associated with genes that are consistent with each factor's previously established tissue-specific functions. tissue-specific binding events are also significantly associated with polycomb targeted chromatin domains. to provide mechanistic insights into tissue-specific regulation, we identify and characterize eye and wing enhancers of the yki-targeted bantam microrna gene and demonstrate that they are dependent on direct binding by hth and sd, respectively. overall these results suggest that both sd and hth use distinct strategies - one shared between tissues and associated with yki, the other tissue-specific, generally yki-independent and associated with developmental patterning - to regulate distinct gene sets during development."

cilia are evolutionarily conserved organelles endowed with essential physiological and developmental functions. in humans, disruption of cilia motility or signaling leads to complex pleiotropic genetic disorders called ciliopathies. cilia motility requires the assembly of multi-subunit motile components such as dynein arms, but mechanisms underlying their assembly pathway and transport into the axoneme are still largely unknown. we identified a previously uncharacterized coiled-coil domain containing protein ccdc151, which is evolutionarily conserved in motile ciliated species and shares ancient features with the outer dynein arm-docking complex 2 of chlamydomonas. in drosophila, we show that cg14127/ccdc151 is associated with motile intraflagellar transport (ift)-dependent cilia and required for geotaxis behavior of adult flies. in zebrafish, ccdc151 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, and morpholino-induced depletion of ccdc151 leads to left-right asymmetry defects and kidney cysts. we demonstrate that ccdc151 is required for proper motile function of cilia in the kupffer's vesicle and in the pronephros by controlling dynein arm assembly, showing that ccdc151 is a novel player in the control of ift-dependent dynein arm assembly in animals. however, we observed that ccdc151 is also implicated in other cellular functions in vertebrates. in zebrafish, ccdc151 is involved in proper orientation of cell divisions in the pronephros and genetically interacts with prickle1 in this process. furthermore, knockdown experiments in mammalian cells demonstrate that ccdc151 is implicated in the regulation of primary cilium length. hence, ccdc151 is required for motile cilia function in animals but has acquired additional non-motile functions in vertebrates.

infections disturb metabolic homeostasis in many contexts, but the underlying connections are not completely understood. to address this, we use paired genetic and computational screens in drosophila to identify transcriptional regulators of immunity and pathology and their associated target genes and physiologies. we show that mef2 is required in the fat body for anabolic function and the immune response. using genetic and biochemical approaches, we find that mef2 is phosphorylated at a conserved site in healthy flies and promotes expression of lipogenic and glycogenic enzymes. upon infection, this phosphorylation is lost, and the activity of mef2 changes--mef2 now associates with the tata binding protein to bind a distinct tata box sequence and promote antimicrobial peptide expression. the loss of phosphorylated mef2 contributes to loss of anabolic enzyme expression in gram-negative bacterial infection. mef2 is thus a critical transcriptional switch in the adult fat body between metabolism and immunity.

notch signaling regulates many fundamental events including lateral inhibition and boundary formation to generate very reproducible patterns in developing tissues. its targets include genes of the bhlh hairy and enhancer of split [e(spl)] family, which contribute to many of these developmental decisions. one member of this family in drosophila, deadpan (dpn), was originally found to have functions independent of notch in promoting neural development. employing genome-wide chromatin-immunoprecipitation we have identified several notch responsive enhancers in dpn, demonstrating its direct regulation by notch in a range of contexts including the drosophila wing and eye. dpn expression largely overlaps that of several e(spl) genes and the combined knock-down leads to more severe phenotypes than either alone. in addition, dpn contributes to the establishment of cut expression at the wing dorsal-ventral (d/v) boundary; in its absence cut expression is delayed. furthermore, over-expression of dpn inhibits expression from e(spl) gene enhancers, but not vice versa, suggesting that dpn contributes to a feed-back mechanism that limits e(spl) gene expression following notch activation. thus the combined actions of dpn and e(spl) appear to provide a mechanism that confers an initial rapid output from notch activity which becomes self-limited via feedback between the targets.

steroid hormones trigger the onset of sexual maturation in animals by initiating genetic response programs that are determined by steroid pulse frequency, amplitude and duration. although steroid pulses coordinate growth and timing of maturation during development, the mechanisms generating these pulses are not known. here we show that the ecdysone steroid pulse that drives the juvenile-adult transition in drosophila is determined by feedback circuits in the prothoracic gland (pg), the major steroid-producing tissue of insect larvae. these circuits coordinate the activation and repression of hormone synthesis, the two key parameters determining pulse shape (amplitude and duration). we show that ecdysone has a positive-feedback effect on the pg, rapidly amplifying its own synthesis to trigger pupariation as the onset of maturation. during the prepupal stage, a negative-feedback signal ensures the decline in ecdysone levels required to produce a temporal steroid pulse that drives developmental progression to adulthood. the feedback circuits rely on a developmental switch in the expression of broad isoforms that transcriptionally activate or silence components in the ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. remarkably, our study shows that the same well-defined genetic program that stimulates a systemic downstream response to ecdysone is also utilized upstream to set the duration and amplitude of the ecdysone pulse. activation of this switch-like mechanism ensures a rapid, self-limiting pg response that functions in producing steroid oscillations that can guide the decision to terminate growth and promote maturation.

long-range integration of transcriptional inputs is critical for gene expression, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. we investigated the molecular determinants that confer fidelity to expression of the heart identity gene even-skipped (eve). targeted deletion of regions bound by the repressor yan defined two novel enhancers that contribute repressive inputs to stabilize tissue-specific output from a third enhancer. deletion of any individual enhancer reduced yan occupancy at the other elements, impacting eve expression, cell fate specification, and cardiac function. these long-range interactions may be stabilized by three-dimensional chromatin contacts that we detected between the elements. our work provides a new paradigm for chromatin-level integration of general repressive inputs with specific patterning information to achieve robust gene expression.

"animals have body parts made of similar cell types located at different axial positions, such as limbs. the identity and distinct morphology of each structure is often specified by the activity of different ""master regulator"" transcription factors. although similarities in gene expression have been observed between body parts made of similar cell types, how regulatory information in the genome is differentially utilized to create morphologically diverse structures in development is not known. here, we use genome-wide open chromatin profiling to show that among the drosophila appendages, the same dna regulatory modules are accessible throughout the genome at a given stage of development, except at the loci encoding the master regulators themselves. in addition, open chromatin profiles change over developmental time, and these changes are coordinated between different appendages. we propose that master regulators create morphologically distinct structures by differentially influencing the function of the same set of dna regulatory modules."

the yolk protein 1 gene (yp1) of drosophila melanogaster is expressed only in the ovarian follicle cells and the fat bodies of adult females. we have previously shown that a different cis-acting dna region is required for each of these tissue specificities. in this paper we use germ line transformation to localize and characterized one of these tissue-specific regulatory regions. we demonstrate that a 125 bp segment of dna located 196 bp upstream of the yp1 cap site is sufficient to determine the sex-, stage-, and fat body-specific expression of the yp1 gene. we also find that this region can confer yp1-specific expression on a heterologous drosophila promoter. this specificity is retained when the region is in different orientations and at different distances from the heterologous promoter. thus a small regulatory region acts in vivo as a positive enhancer to determine the fat body expression pattern of yp1.

in the early drosophila melanogaster embryo, dpp, a secreted molecule that belongs to the tgf-β superfamily of growth factors, activates a set of downstream genes to subdivide the dorsal region into amnioserosa and dorsal epidermis. here, we examined the expression pattern and transcriptional regulation of dtg, a new target gene of dpp signaling pathway that is required for proper amnioserosa differentiation. we showed that the expression of dtg was controlled by dpp and characterized a 524-bp enhancer that mediated expression in the dorsal midline, as well as, in the differentiated amnioserosa in transgenic reporter embryos. this enhancer contained a highly conserved region of 48-bp in which bioinformatic predictions and in vitro assays identified three mad binding motifs. mutational analysis revealed that these three motifs were necessary for proper expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos, suggesting that short and highly conserved genomic sequences may be indicative of functional regulatory regions in d. melanogaster genes. dtg orthologs were not detected in basal lineages of dipterans, which unlike d. melanogaster develop two extra-embryonic membranes, amnion and serosa, nevertheless dtg orthologs were identified in the transcriptome of musca domestica, in which dorsal ectoderm patterning leads to the formation of a single extra-embryonic membrane. these results suggest that dtg was recruited as a new component of the network that controls dorsal ectoderm patterning in the lineage leading to higher cyclorrhaphan flies, such as d. melanogaster and m. domestica.

wiring between signaling pathways differs according to context, as exemplified by interactions between notch and epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) pathways, which are cooperative in some contexts but antagonistic in others. to investigate mechanisms that underlie different modes of cross talk, we have focused on argos, an egfr pathway regulator in drosophila melanogaster which is upregulated by notch in adult muscle progenitors but is repressed in the wing. results show that the alternate modes of cross talk depend on the engagement of enhancers with opposite regulatory logic, which are selected by context-determining factors. this is likely to be a general mechanism for enabling the wiring between these pathways to switch according to context.

background: broadly expressed transcriptions factors (tfs) control tissue-specific programs of gene expression through interactions with local tf networks. a prime example is the circadian clock: although the conserved tfs clock (clk) and cycle (cyc) control a transcriptional circuit throughout animal bodies, rhythms in behavior and physiology are generated tissue specifically. yet, how clk and cyc determine tissue-specific clock programs has remained unclear. results: here, we use a functional genomics approach to determine the cis-regulatory requirements for clock specificity. we first determine clk and cyc genome-wide binding targets in heads and bodies by chip-seq and show that they have distinct dna targets in the two tissue contexts. computational dissection of clk/cyc context-specific binding sites reveals sequence motifs for putative partner factors, which are predictive for individual binding sites. among them, we show that the opa and gata motifs, differentially enriched in head and body binding sites respectively, can be bound by opa and serpent (srp). they act synergistically with clk/cyc in the drosophila feedback loop, suggesting that they help to determine their direct targets and therefore orchestrate tissue-specific clock outputs. in addition, using in vivo transgenic assays, we validate that gata motifs are required for proper tissue-specific gene expression in the adult fat body, midgut, and malpighian tubules, revealing a cis-regulatory signature for enhancers of the peripheral circadian clock. conclusions: our results reveal how universal clock circuits can regulate tissue-specific rhythms and, more generally, provide insights into the mechanism by which universal tfs can be modulated to drive tissue-specific programs of gene expression.

the functionality of sensory neurons is defined by the expression of specific sensory receptor genes. during the development of the drosophila larval eye, photoreceptor neurons (prs) make a binary choice to express either the blue-sensitive rhodopsin 5 (rh5) or the green-sensitive rhodopsin 6 (rh6). later during metamorphosis, ecdysone signaling induces a cell fate and sensory receptor switch: rh5-prs are re-programmed to express rh6 and become the eyelet, a small group of extraretinal prs involved in circadian entrainment. however, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of how the binary cell fate decisions are made and switched remain poorly understood. we show that interplay of two transcription factors senseless (sens) and hazy control cell fate decisions, terminal differentiation of the larval eye and its transformation into eyelet. during initial differentiation, a pulse of sens expression in primary precursors regulates their differentiation into rh5-prs and repression of an alternative rh6-cell fate. later, during the transformation of the larval eye into the adult eyelet, sens serves as an anti-apoptotic factor in rh5-prs, which helps in promoting survival of rh5-prs during metamorphosis and is subsequently required for rh6 expression. comparably, during pr differentiation hazy functions in initiation and maintenance of rhodopsin expression. hazy represses sens specifically in the rh6-prs, allowing them to die during metamorphosis. our findings show that the same transcription factors regulate diverse aspects of larval and adult pr development at different stages and in a context-dependent manner.

"the transcription factors of the snail family are key regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, cell morphogenesis, and tumor metastasis. since its discovery in drosophila ∼25 years ago, snail has been extensively studied for its role as a transcriptional repressor. here we demonstrate that drosophila snail can positively modulate transcriptional activation. by combining information on in vivo occupancy with expression profiling of hand-selected, staged snail mutant embryos, we identified 106 genes that are potentially directly regulated by snail during mesoderm development. in addition to the expected snail-repressed genes, almost 50% of snail targets showed an unanticipated activation. the majority of ""snail-activated"" genes have enhancer elements cobound by twist and are expressed in the mesoderm at the stages of snail occupancy. snail can potentiate twist-mediated enhancer activation in vitro and is essential for enhancer activity in vivo. using a machine learning approach, we show that differentially enriched motifs are sufficient to predict snail's regulatory response. in silico mutagenesis revealed a likely causative motif, which we demonstrate is essential for enhancer activation. taken together, these data indicate that snail can potentiate enhancer activation by collaborating with different activators, providing a new mechanism by which snail regulates development."

how neurons form appropriately sized dendritic fields to encounter their presynaptic partners is poorly understood. the drosophila medulla is organized in layers and columns and innervated by medulla neuron dendrites and photoreceptor axons. here, we show that three types of medulla projection (tm) neurons extend their dendrites in stereotyped directions and to distinct layers within a single column for processing retinotopic information. in contrast, the dm8 amacrine neurons form a wide dendritic field to receive ∼16 r7 photoreceptor inputs. r7- and r8-derived activin selectively restricts the dendritic fields of their respective postsynaptic partners, dm8 and tm20, to the size appropriate for their functions. canonical activin signaling promotes dendritic termination without affecting dendritic routing direction or layer. tm20 neurons lacking activin signaling expanded their dendritic fields and aberrantly synapsed with neighboring photoreceptors. we suggest that afferent-derived activin regulates the dendritic field size of their postsynaptic partners to ensure appropriate synaptic partnership.

within the drosophila embryo, two related bhlh-pas proteins, single-minded and trachealess, control development of the central nervous system midline and the trachea, respectively. these two proteins are bhlh-pas transcription factors and independently form heterodimers with another bhlh-pas protein, tango. during early embryogenesis, expression of single-minded is restricted to the midline and trachealess to the trachea and salivary glands, whereas tango is ubiquitously expressed. both single-minded/tango and trachealess/tango heterodimers bind to the same dna sequence, called the cns midline element (cme) within cis-regulatory sequences of downstream target genes. while single-minded/tango and trachealess/tango activate some of the same genes in their respective tissues during embryogenesis, they also activate a number of different genes restricted to only certain tissues. the goal of this research is to understand how these two related heterodimers bind different enhancers to activate different genes, thereby regulating the development of functionally diverse tissues. existing data indicates that single-minded and trachealess may bind to different co-factors restricted to various tissues, causing them to interact with the cme only within certain sequence contexts. this would lead to the activation of different target genes in different cell types. to understand how the context surrounding the cme is recognized by different bhlh-pas heterodimers and their co-factors, we identified and analyzed novel enhancers that drive midline and/or tracheal expression and compared them to previously characterized enhancers. in addition, we tested expression of synthetic reporter genes containing the cme flanked by different sequences. taken together, these experiments identify elements overrepresented within midline and tracheal enhancers and suggest that sequences immediately surrounding a cme help dictate whether a gene is expressed in the midline or trachea.

the drosophila heart is composed of two distinct cell types, the contractile cardial cells (ccs) and the surrounding non-muscle pericardial cells (pcs), development of which is regulated by a network of conserved signaling molecules and transcription factors (tfs). here, we used machine learning with array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) data and tf sequence motifs to computationally classify cell type-specific cardiac enhancers. extensive testing of predicted enhancers at single-cell resolution revealed the added value of chip data for modeling cell type-specific activities. furthermore, clustering the top-scoring classifier sequence features identified novel cardiac and cell type-specific regulatory motifs. for example, we found that the myb motif learned by the classifier is crucial for cc activity, and the myb tf acts in concert with two forkhead domain tfs and polo kinase to regulate cardiac progenitor cell divisions. in addition, differential motif enrichment and cis-trans genetic studies revealed that the notch signaling pathway tf suppressor of hairless [su(h)] discriminates pc from cc enhancer activities. collectively, these studies elucidate molecular pathways used in the regulatory decisions for proliferation and differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells, implicate su(h) in regulating cell fate decisions of these progenitors, and document the utility of enhancer modeling in uncovering developmental regulatory subnetworks.

in drosophila, the 330 kb bithorax complex regulates cellular differentiation along the anterior–posterior axis during development in the thorax and abdomen and is comprised of three homeotic genes: ultrabithorax, abdominal-a, and abdominal-b. the expression of each of these genes is in turn controlled through interactions between transcription factors and a number of cis-regulatory modules in the neighboring intergenic regions. in this study, we examine how the sequence architecture of transcription factor binding sites mediates the functional activity of one of these cis-regulatory modules. using computational, mathematical modeling and experimental molecular genetic approaches we investigate the iab7b enhancer, which regulates abdominal-b expression specifically in the presumptive seventh and ninth abdominal segments of the early embryo. a cross-species comparison of the iab7b enhancer reveals an evolutionarily conserved signature motif containing two fushi-tarazu activator transcription factor binding sites. we find that the transcriptional repressors knirps, kruppel and giant are able to restrict reporter gene expression to the posterior abdominal segments, using different molecular mechanisms including short-range repression and competitive binding. additionally, we show the functional importance of the spacing between the two fushi-tarazu binding sites and discuss the potential importance of cooperativity for transcriptional activation. our results demonstrate that the transcriptional output of the iab7b cis-regulatory module relies on a complex set of combinatorial inputs mediated by specific transcription factor binding and that the sequence architecture at this enhancer is critical to maintain robust regulatory function.

evolutionary changes in traits involved in both ecological divergence and mate choice may produce reproductive isolation and speciation. however, there are few examples of such dual traits, and the genetic and molecular bases of their evolution have not been identified. we show that methyl-branched cuticular hydrocarbons (mbchcs) are a dual trait that affects both desiccation resistance and mate choice in drosophila serrata. we identify a fatty acid synthase mfas (cg3524) responsible for mbchc production in drosophila and find that expression of mfas is undetectable in oenocytes (cells that produce chcs) of a closely related, desiccation-sensitive species, d. birchii, due in part to multiple changes in cis-regulatory sequences of mfas. we suggest that ecologically influenced changes in the production of mbchcs have contributed to reproductive isolation between the two species.

cilia play major functions in physiology and development, and ciliary dysfunctions are responsible for several diseases in humans called ciliopathies. cilia motility is required for cell and fluid propulsion in organisms. in humans, cilia motility deficiencies lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, with upper-airways recurrent infections, left-right asymmetry perturbations, and fertility defects. in drosophila, we identified hemingway (hmw) as a novel component required for motile cilia function. hmw encodes a 604-amino acid protein characterized by a highly conserved coiled-coil domain also found in the human orthologue, kiaa1430. we show that hmw is conserved in species with motile cilia and that, in drosophila, hmw is expressed in ciliated sensory neurons and spermatozoa. we created hmw-knockout flies and found that they are hearing impaired and male sterile. hmw is implicated in the motility of ciliated auditory sensory neurons and, in the testis, is required for elongation and maintenance of sperm flagella. because hmw is absent from mature flagella, we propose that hmw is not a structural component of the motile axoneme but is required for proper acquisition of motile properties. this identifies hmw as a novel, evolutionarily conserved component necessary for motile cilium function and flagella assembly.

background: vertebrates and invertebrates obtain visual motion information by channeling moving visual cues perceived by the retina through specific motion sensitive synaptic relays in the brain. in drosophila, the series of synaptic relays forming the optic lobe are known as the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate neuropiles. the fly's motion detection output neurons, called the t4 and t5 cells, reside in the lobula plate. adult optic lobe neurons are derived from larval neural progenitors in two proliferating compartments known as the outer and inner proliferation centers (opc and ipc). important insight has been gained into molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the lamina and medulla from the opc, though less is known about the development of the lobula and lobula plate. results: here we show that the proneural gene atonal is expressed in a subset of ipc progenitors that give rise to the higher order motion detection neurons, t4 and t5, of the lobula plate. we also show that atonal does not act as a proneural gene in this context. rather, it is required specifically in ipc neural progenitors to regulate neurite outgrowth in the neuronal progeny. conclusions: our findings reveal that a proneural gene is expressed in progenitors but is required for neurite development of their progeny neurons. this suggests that transcriptional programs initiated specifically in progenitors are necessary for subsequent neuronal morphogenesis.

the phylogenetically conserved family of muscleblind proteins are rna-binding factors involved in a variety of gene expression processes including alternative splicing regulation, rna stability and subcellular localization, and mirna biogenesis, which typically contribute to cell-type specific differentiation. in humans, sequestration of muscleblind-like proteins mbnl1 and mbnl2 has been implicated in degenerative disorders, particularly expansion diseases such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2. drosophila muscleblind was previously shown to be expressed in embryonic somatic and visceral muscle subtypes, and in the central nervous system, and to depend on mef2 for transcriptional activation. genomic approaches have pointed out candidate gene promoters and tissue-specific enhancers, but experimental confirmation of their regulatory roles was lacking. in our study, luciferase reporter assays in s2 cells confirmed that regions p1 (515 bp) and p2 (573 bp), involving the beginning of exon 1 and exon 2, respectively, were able to initiate rna transcription. similarly, transgenic drosophila embryos carrying enhancer reporter constructs supported the existence of two regulatory regions which control embryonic expression of muscleblind in the central nerve cord (ne, neural enhancer; 830 bp) and somatic (skeletal) musculature (me, muscle enhancer; 3.3 kb). both ne and me were able to boost expression from the hsp70 heterologous promoter. in s2 cell assays most of the me enhancer activation could be further narrowed down to a 1200 bp subregion (me.3), which contains predicted binding sites for the mef2 transcription factor. the present study constitutes the first characterization of muscleblind enhancers and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the gene.

the construction and prediction of cell fate maps at the whole embryo level require the establishment of an accurate atlas of gene expression patterns throughout development and the identification of the corresponding cis-regulatory sequences. however, while the expression and regulation of genes encoding upstream developmental regulators such as transcription factors or signaling pathway components have been analyzed in detail, up to date the number of cis-regulatory sequences identified for downstream effector genes, like ion channels, pumps and exchangers, is very low. the control and regulation of ion homeostasis in each cell, including at blastoderm stages, are essential for normal embryonic development. in this study, we analyzed in detail the embryonic expression pattern and cis-regulatory modules of the drosophila na+-driven anion exchanger 1 (ndae1) gene, involved in the regulation of ph homeostasis. we show that ndae1 is expressed in a tight and complex spatial-temporal pattern. in particular, we report that this downstream effector gene is under the control of the canonical dorsal-ventral patterning cascade through dorsal, toll, twist and snail at early embryogenesis. moreover, we identify several cis-regulatory modules, some of which control discrete and non-overlapping aspects of endogenous gene expression throughout development.

steroid hormones act as important developmental switches, and their nuclear receptors regulate many genes. however, few hormone-dependent enhancers have been characterized, and important aspects of their sequence architecture, cell-type-specific activating and repressing functions, or the regulatory roles of their chromatin structure have remained unclear. we used starr-seq, a recently developed enhancer-screening assay, and ecdysone signaling in two different drosophila cell types to derive genome-wide hormone-dependent enhancer-activity maps. we demonstrate that enhancer activation depends on cis-regulatory motif combinations that differ between cell types and can predict cell-type-specific ecdysone targeting. activated enhancers are often not accessible prior to induction. enhancer repression following hormone treatment seems independent of receptor motifs and receptor binding to the enhancer, as we show using chip-seq, but appears to rely on motifs for other factors, including eip74. our strategy is applicable to study signal-dependent enhancers for different pathways and across organisms.

in contrast to the hsp70 gene, whose expression is normally at a very low level and increases by more than 2 orders of magnitude during heat shock, the hsp83 gene in drosophila melanogaster is expressed at high levels during normal development and increases only severalfold in response to heat shock. developmental expression of the hsp83 gene consists of a high level of tissue-general, basal expression and a very high level of expression in ovaries. we identified regions upstream of the hsp83 gene that were required for its developmental and heat shock-induced expression by assaying beta-galactosidase activity and mrna levels in transgenic animals containing a series of 5' deletion and insertion mutations of an hsp83-lacz fusion gene. deletion of sequences upstream of the overlapping array of a previously defined heat shock consensus (hsc) sequence eliminated both forms of developmental expression of the hsp83 gene. as a result, the hsp83 gene with this deletion mutation was regulated like that of the hsp70 gene. moreover, an in vivo polymer competition assay revealed that the overlapping hsc sequences of the hsp83 gene and the nonoverlapping hsc sequences of the hsp70 gene had similar affinities for the factor required for heat induction of the two heat shock genes. we discuss the functional similarity of hsp70 and hsp83 heat shock regulation in terms of a revised view of the heat shock-regulatory sequence.

positive autoregulation is an effective mechanism for the long-term maintenance of a transcription factor's expression. this strategy is widely deployed in cell lineages, where the autoregulatory factor controls the activity of a battery of genes that constitute the differentiation program of a postmitotic cell type. in drosophila, the notch pathway transcription factor suppressor of hairless activates its own expression, specifically in the socket cell of external sensory organs, via an autoregulatory enhancer called the ase. here, we show that the ase is composed of several enhancer submodules, each of which can independently initiate weak su(h) autoregulation. cross-activation by these submodules is critical to ensure that su(h) rises above a threshold level necessary to activate a maintenance submodule, which then sustains long-term su(h) autoregulation. our study reveals the use of interlinked positive-feedback loops to control autoregulation dynamically and provides mechanistic insight into initiation, establishment, and maintenance of the autoregulatory state.

the cdk8 (cyclin-dependent kinase 8) module of mediator integrates regulatory cues from transcription factors to rna polymerase ii. it consists of four subunits where med12 and med13 link cdk8 and cyclin c (cycc) to core mediator. here we have investigated the contributions of the cdk8 module subunits to transcriptional regulation using rna interference in drosophila cells. genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated separation of cdk8-cycc and med12-med13 profiles. however, transcriptional regulation by cdk8-cycc was dependent on med12-med13. this observation also revealed that cdk8-cycc and med12-med13 often have opposite transcriptional effects. interestingly, med12 and med13 profiles overlapped significantly with that of the gata factor serpent. accordingly, mutational analyses indicated that gata sites are required for med12-med13 regulation of serpent-dependent genes. med12 and med13 were also found to be required for serpent-activated innate immunity genes in defense to bacterial infection. the results reveal a novel role for the cdk8 module in serpent-dependent transcription and innate immunity.

the drosophila z600 gene is a member of an overlapping gene cluster located in the 71cd interval of chromosome 3. we have used several approaches to study the spatial and temporal expression of z600 during embryogenesis. northern analysis shows that z600 is zygotically expressed, with gene transcripts accumulating transiently during early embryo-genesis. the localization of z600 transcripts in embryo sections by in situ hybridization reveals a dynamic pattern of rna distribution. z600 rna is distributed throughout the embryo during the midsyncytial blastoderm stage, becomes concentrated dorsally and posteriorly during cellularization, and persists in the dorsal-most region of the embryo during gastrulation and germ band extension. z600 transcript accumulation is altered in dorsalized or ventralized mutant embryos, suggesting that z600 is directly or indirectly regulated by genes specifying the dorsal-ventral pattern in the embryo. an analysis of germ line transformants harboring a z600-lacz gene fusion demonstrates that a 276-bp dna region contains the sequences responsible for dorsal activation, but not ventral repression, of z600 gene expression during early embryogenesis.

transcriptional enhancers integrate information derived from transcription factor binding to control gene expression. one key question concerns the extent of trans- and cis-regulatory variation in how co-expressed genes are controlled. the drosophila cns midline cells constitute a group of neurons and glia in which expression changes can be readily characterized during specification and differentiation. using a transgenic approach, we compare the cis-regulation of multiple genes expressed in the drosophila cns midline primordium cells, and show that while the expression patterns may appear alike, the target genes are not equivalent in how these common expression patterns are achieved. some genes utilize a single enhancer that promotes expression in all midline cells, while others utilize multiple enhancers with distinct spatial, temporal, and quantitative contributions. two regulators, single-minded and notch, play key roles in controlling early midline gene expression. while single-minded is expected to control expression of most, if not all, midline primordium-expressed genes, the role of notch in directly controlling midline transcription is unknown. midline primordium expression of the rhomboid gene is dependent on cell signaling by the notch signaling pathway. mutational analysis of a rhomboid enhancer reveals at least 5 distinct types of functional cis-control elements, including a binding site for the notch effector, suppressor of hairless. the results suggest a model in which notch/suppressor of hairless levels are insufficient to activate rhomboid expression by itself, but does so in conjunction with additional factors, some of which, including single-minded, provide midline specificity to notch activation. similarly, a midline glial enhancer from the argos gene, which is dependent on egf/spitz signaling, is directly regulated by contributions from both pointed, the egf transcriptional effector, and single-minded. in contrast, midline primordium expression of other genes shows a strong dependence on single-minded and varying combinations of additional transcription factors. thus, single-minded directly regulates midline primordium-expressed genes, but in some cases plays a primary role in directing target gene midline expression, and in others provides midline specificity to cell signaling inputs.

retrogenes are functional processed copies of genes that originate via the retrotranscription of an mrna intermediate and often exhibit testis-specific expression. although this expression pattern appears to be favored by selection, the origin of such expression bias remains unexplained. here, we study the regulation of two young testis-specific drosophila retrogenes, dntf-2r and pros28.1a, using genetic transformation and the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter gene in drosophila melanogaster. we show that two different short (<24 bp) regions upstream of the transcription start sites (tsss) act as testis-specific regulatory motifs in these genes. the dntf-2r regulatory region is similar to the known β2 tubulin 14-bp testis motif (β2-tubulin gene upstream element 1 [β2-ue1]). comparative sequence analyses reveal that this motif was already present before the dntf-2r insertion and was likely driving the transcription of a noncoding rna. we also show that the β2-ue1 occurs in the regulatory regions of other testis-specific retrogenes, and is functional in either orientation. in contrast, the pros28.1a testes regulatory region in d. melanogaster appears to be novel. only pros28.1b, an older paralog of the pros28.1 gene family, seems to carry a similar regulatory sequence. it is unclear how the pros28.1a regulatory region was acquired in d. melanogaster, but it might have evolved de novo from within a region that may have been preprimed for testes expression. we conclude that relocation is critical for the evolutionary origin of male germline-specific cis-regulatory regions of retrogenes because expression depends on either the site of the retrogene insertion or the sequence changes close to the tss thereafter. as a consequence we infer that positive selection will play a role in the evolution of these regulatory regions and can often act from the moment of the retrocopy insertion.

a balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is important for normal development and tissue homeostasis. under stress conditions, the conserved tumor suppressor and transcription factor dp53 induces apoptosis to contribute to the maintenance of homeostasis. however, in some cases dp53-induced apoptosis results in the proliferation of surrounding non-apoptotic cells. to gain insight into the dp53 function in the control of apoptosis and proliferation, we studied the interaction between the drosophila dp53 and notch genes. we present evidence that simultaneous reduction of dp53 and notch function synergistically increases the wing phenotype of notch heterozygous mutant flies. further, we found that a notch cis-regulatory element is responsive to loss and gain of dp53 function and that over-expression of dp53 up-regulates notch mrna and protein expression. these findings suggest not only that dp53 and notch act together to control wing development but also indicate that dp53 transcriptionally regulates notch expression. moreover, using notch gain and loss of function mutations we examined the relevance of dp53 and notch interactions in the process of dp53-apoptosis induced proliferation. results show that proliferation induced by dp53 over-expression is dependent on notch, thus identifying notch as a new player in dp53-induced proliferation. interestingly, we found that dp53-induced notch activation and proliferation occurs even under conditions where apoptosis was inhibited. our findings highlight the conservation between flies and vertebrates of the dp53 and notch cross-talk and suggest that dp53 has a dual role regulating cell death and proliferation gene networks to control the homeostatic balance between apoptosis and proliferation.

class i basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors form homodimers or heterodimers with class ii bhlh proteins. while bhlh heterodimers are known to have diverse roles, little is known about the role of class i homodimers. in this manuscript, we show that a linked dimer of daughterless (da), the only drosophila class i bhlh protein, activates atonal (ato) expression and retinal neuron differentiation synergistically with the retinal determination factor eyeless (ey). the hlh protein extramacrocheate (emc), which forms heterodimer with da, antagonizes the synergistic activation from da but not the da-da linked dimer with ey. we show that da directly interacts with ey and promotes ey binding to the ey binding site in the ato 3׳ enhancer. interestingly, the ey binding site in the ato 3׳ enhancer contains an embedded e-box that is also required for the synergistic activation by ey and da. finally we show that mammalian homologs of ey and da can functionally replace their drosophila counterparts to synergistically activate the ato enhancer, suggesting that the observed function is evolutionary conserved.

transcriptional enhancers are crucial regulators of gene expression and animal development and the characterization of their genomic organization, spatiotemporal activities and sequence properties is a key goal in modern biology. here we characterize the in vivo activity of 7,705 drosophila melanogaster enhancer candidates covering 13.5% of the non-coding non-repetitive genome throughout embryogenesis. 3,557 (46%) candidates are active, suggesting a high density with 50,000 to 100,000 developmental enhancers genome-wide. the vast majority of enhancers display specific spatial patterns that are highly dynamic during development. most appear to regulate their neighbouring genes, suggesting that the cis-regulatory genome is organized locally into domains, which are supported by chromosomal domains, insulator binding and genome evolution. however, 12 to 21 per cent of enhancers appear to skip non-expressed neighbours and regulate a more distal gene. finally, we computationally identify cis-regulatory motifs that are predictive and required for enhancer activity, as we validate experimentally. this work provides global insights into the organization of an animal regulatory genome and the make-up of enhancer sequences and confirms and generalizes principles from previous studies. all enhancer patterns are annotated manually with a controlled vocabulary and all results are available through a web interface (http://enhancers.starklab.org), including the raw images of all microscopy slides for manual inspection at arbitrary zoom levels.

"the generation of complex morphological features requires the precisely orchestrated expression of numerous genes during development. while several traits have been resolved to evolutionary changes within a single gene, the evolutionary path by which genes derive co-localized or mutually excluded expression patterns is currently a mystery. here we investigate how the drosophila pigmentation gene network was altered in drosophila prostipennis, a species in the drosophila melanogaster subgroup, that evolved expanded abdominal pigmentation. we show that this expansion involved broadened expression of the melanin-promoting enzyme genes tan and yellow, and a reciprocal withdrawn pattern of the melanin-suppressing enzyme gene ebony. to examine whether these coordinated changes to the network were generated through mutations in the cis-regulatory elements (cres) of these genes, we cloned and tested cres of d. prostipennis tan, ebony, and yellow in transgenic reporter assays. regulatory regions of both tan and ebony failed to recapitulate the derived d. prostipennis expression phenotype, implicating the modification of a factor or factors upstream of both genes. however, the d. prostipennis yellow cis-regulatory region recapitulated the expanded expression pattern observed in this species, implicating causative mutations in cis to yellow. our results provide an example in which a coordinated expression program evolved through independent changes at multiple loci, rather than through changes to a single ""master regulator"" directing a suite of downstream target genes. this implies a complex network structure in which each gene may be subject to a unique set of inputs, and resultantly may require individualized evolutionary paths to yield correlated gene expression patterns."

zygotic genome activation (zga) is a major genome programming event whereby the cells of the embryo begin to adopt specified fates. experiments in drosophila and zebrafish have revealed that zga depends on transcription factors that provide large-scale control of gene expression by direct and specific binding to gene regulatory sequences. zelda (zld) plays such a role in the drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear. a recent model proposed that zld binding sites act as quantitative regulators of the spatiotemporal expression of genes activated by dorsal (dl), the morphogen that patterns the dorsoventral axis. here we tested this model experimentally, using enhancers of brinker (brk) and short gastrulation (sog), both of which are directly activated by dl, but at different concentration thresholds. in agreement with the model, we show that there is a clear positive correlation between the number of zld binding sites and the spatial domain of enhancer activity. likewise, the timing of expression could be advanced or delayed. we present evidence that zld facilitates binding of dl to regulatory dna, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. importantly, the change in chromatin accessibility is strongly correlated with the change in zld binding, but not dl. we propose that the ability of genome activators to facilitate readout of transcriptional input is key to widespread transcriptional induction during zga.

specialized endocrine cells produce and release steroid hormones that govern development, metabolism and reproduction. in order to synthesize steroids, all the genes in the biosynthetic pathway must be coordinately turned on in steroidogenic cells. in drosophila, the steroid producing endocrine cells are located in the prothoracic gland (pg) that releases the steroid hormone ecdysone. the transcriptional regulatory network that specifies the unique pg specific expression pattern of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes remains unknown. here, we show that two transcription factors, the pou-domain ventral veins lacking (vvl) and the nuclear receptor knirps (kni), have essential roles in the pg during larval development. vvl is highly expressed in the pg during embryogenesis and is enriched in the gland during larval development, suggesting that vvl might function as a master transcriptional regulator in this tissue. vvl and kni bind to pg specific cis-regulatory elements that are required for expression of the ecdysone biosynthetic genes. knock down of either vvl or kni in the pg results in a larval developmental arrest due to failure in ecdysone production. furthermore, vvl and kni are also required for maintenance of tor/s6k and prothoracicotropic hormone (ptth) signaling in the pg, two major pathways that control ecdysone biosynthesis and pg cell growth. we also show that the transcriptional regulator, molting defective (mld), controls early biosynthetic pathway steps. our data show that vvl and kni directly regulate ecdysone biosynthesis by transcriptional control of biosynthetic gene expression and indirectly by affecting ptth and tor/s6k signaling. this provides new insight into the regulatory network of transcription factors involved in the coordinated regulation of steroidogenic cell specific transcription, and identifies a new function of vvl and knirps in endocrine cells during post-embryonic development.

molecular models of cell fate specification typically focus on the activation of specific lineage programs. however, the concurrent repression of unwanted transcriptional networks is also essential to stabilize certain cellular identities, as shown in a number of diverse systems and phyla. here, we demonstrate that this dual requirement also holds true in the context of drosophila myogenesis. by integrating genetics and genomics, we identified a new role for the pleiotropic transcriptional repressor tramtrack69 in myoblast specification. drosophila muscles are formed through the fusion of two discrete cell types: founder cells (fcs) and fusion-competent myoblasts (fcms). when tramtrack69 is removed, fcms appear to adopt an alternative muscle fc-like fate. conversely, ectopic expression of this repressor phenocopies muscle defects seen in loss-of-function lame duck mutants, a transcription factor specific to fcms. this occurs through tramtrack69-mediated repression in fcms, whereas lame duck activates a largely distinct transcriptional program in the same cells. lineage-specific factors are therefore not sufficient to maintain fcm identity. instead, their identity appears more plastic, requiring the combination of instructive repressive and activating programs to stabilize cell fate.

background: developmental transcriptional regulatory networks are circuits of transcription factors (tfs) and cis-acting dna elements (cis regulatory modules, crms) that dynamically control expression of downstream genes. comprehensive knowledge of these networks is an essential step towards our understanding of developmental processes. however, this knowledge is mostly based on genome-wide mapping of transcription factor binding sites, and therefore requires prior knowledge regarding the tfs involved in the network. results: focusing on how temporal control of gene expression is integrated within a developmental network, we applied an in silico approach to discover regulatory motifs and crms of co-expressed genes, with no prior knowledge about the involved tfs. our aim was to identify regulatory motifs and potential trans-acting factors which regulate the temporal expression of co-expressed gene sets during a particular process of organogenesis, namely adult heart formation in drosophila. starting from whole genome tissue specific expression dynamics, we used an in silico method, cistargetx, to predict tf binding motifs and crms. potential nuclear receptor (nr) binding motifs were predicted to control the temporal expression profile of a gene set with increased expression levels during mid metamorphosis. the predicted crms and nr motifs were validated in vivo by reporter gene essays. in addition, we provide evidence that three nrs modulate crm activity and behave as temporal regulators of target enhancers. conclusions: our approach was successful in identifying crms and potential tfs acting on the temporal regulation of target genes. in addition, our results suggest a modular architecture of the regulatory machinery, in which the temporal and spatial regulation can be uncoupled and encoded by distinct crms.

we report temporal and tissue-specific patterns of expression of the 79b actin gene in drosophila. the pattern of accumulation of 79b actin transcripts was determined and compared to the expression of a 79b actin promoter fused to the escherichia coli beta-galactosidase reporter gene. this chimeric gene contained approximately 4 kb of 5' flanking dna from the 79b actin gene. we found that beta-galactosidase activity in transformants was localized in the same tissues and possessed the same developmental timing as the transcripts of the 79b actin gene. expression is limited to tubular-type muscles found predominantly in the thorax and leg, including the direct flight muscles, pleurosternal muscles, and muscles of the various leg segments. in addition, the 79b actin gene is expressed in muscles which support the head and abdomen, in the scutellar pulsatile organ, and in abdominal muscles which are present only in male flies.

at least two cis-regulatory elements are necessary for correct neuron-specific expression of the drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase gene, ddc. in addition to a previously described proximal element located approximately 60 bp upstream of the mrna start site, we have now characterized a distal approximately 600-bp dna fragment, extending from -1019 to -1623 bp, which possesses enhancer-like properties and is essential for normal neuron-specific expression. immunofluorescent labeling of neurons expressing deleted ddc genes indicates that this region contains both general neuronal regulatory elements and cell-specific elements that selectively affect ddc expression in either dopaminergic or serotonergic neurons. these selective effects can be correlated with the removal of sequence elements that are protected from dnase digestion by factors present in embryonic nuclear extracts. several of these elements are also homologous to sequences located upstream of the evolutionarily diverged ddc gene of drosophila virilis. these results suggest that the neuron-specific expression of ddc results from the combined action of several factors binding within this distal enhancer region.

the drosophila e74 gene is one of a small set of genes induced directly by the steroid hormone ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis. both in vitro and in vivo transcription assays have been used to delineate the promoter for the 6-kb e74 mrna. sequences upstream from position -83 had little effect on the amount of rna synthesized in vitro, using extracts prepared from drosophila kc tissue culture cells. deletion of a 5'-flanking tata consensus sequence had no effect on the accuracy of transcriptional initiation and resulted in an increase in rna synthesis, suggesting removal of a repressor binding site. surprisingly, removal of the first two nucleotides of the transcribed region still allowed relatively high levels of transcription from the correct start site position. removal of five additional nucleotides inactivated the promoter. in vitro transcription of a series of 3' deletions defined the 3' in vitro promoter boundary at position +43. additional 5'-flanking sequences, between -181 and -83, were found to be necessary for efficient transcription in transfected kc tissue culture cells. two transcription factors that interact with the e74 promoter, zeste and gaga, were studied in dna-binding assays. zeste binds to two sites within the e74 promoter. these sites overlap with three of the six gaga-binding sites. the zeste- and gaga-binding sites lie within domains identified by deletion mapping as cis-acting transcriptional control elements.

the maternal gene bicoid is a key component of the system that determines the pattern of the anterior half of drosophila embryos. the bicoid protein forms a concentration gradient in early embryos, and is known to bind dna. specific binding sites are now shown to confer expression in a region of the embryo that depends on their affinity for bicoid protein: sites of high affinity allow expression further down the bicoid protein gradient than sites of low affinity.

the sevenless gene encodes a cell surface receptor that has protein-tyrosine kinase activity and is expressed in a highly specific and complex pattern in the developing drosophila eye. we have coupled the sevenless promoter to the reporter gene lacz and have examined the pattern of beta-galactosidase expression in the developing eyes of transgenic larvae. our results indicate that the dynamic pattern of sevenless protein expression is regulated transcriptionally. promoter sequences located 5' of the coding region are insufficient for the wild-type level of gene expression but appear to be able to confer the correct pattern of expression. in contrast, enhancer sequences within the body of the gene can confer both the correct pattern and a normal level of expression on either the sevenless promoter or heterologous promoters. thus the complex pattern of sevenless expression is redundantly encoded within proximal promoter sequences and enhancer elements internal to the gene but relies on these enhancer sequences for correct quantitative expression.

to analyze the regulation of gene expression during male germ cell development, we investigated the testis-specific expression of the drosophila beta 2 tubulin gene. germ line transformation experiments with the upstream region of the d.melanogaster beta 2 tubulin gene fused to the escherichia coli lacz gene resulted in the correct tissue specific expression of the reporter gene. furthermore, we showed that the upstream sequences of the beta 2 tubulin gene of the distantly related species d.hydei can drive the expression of the lacz gene testis specifically in d.melanogaster flies. a detailed deletion analysis showed that 53 bp of upstream and 23 bp (d.melanogaster) or 29 bp (d.hydei) of leader sequences are sufficient to confer tissue specificity. the short promoter regions contain a 14 bp motif at identical positions in both species, which acts as a position-dependent promoter element. in vitro mutagenesis and subsequent germline transformation experiments revealed that this sequence is the only element necessary for the testis-specific transcription of the beta 2 tubulin gene in drosophila.

the drosophila serendipity alpha gene (sry alpha) is specifically expressed at the blastoderm stage in all somatic cells. by deletion analysis of sry alpha-lacz fusion genes, the sry alpha cis-acting regulatory elements have been restricted to the [-311, +130] 5'-region of the gene and separated in two domains. the [-118, +130] domain is sufficient for transcriptional activation at the blastoderm stage. the [-311, -118] domain is required for a full level of expression. deletion of this upstream domain leads to a secondary pattern of lacz expression in precursor cells of the peripheral nervous system (pns). the sry alpha gene is not itself secondarily expressed in the pns, as shown by in situ hybridization. the patterns of expression of the different sry alpha-lacz fusion genes suggest a combinatorial mode of regulation of sry alpha expression at blastoderm.

serendipity delta (sry delta) is a member of a set of drosophila zinc finger protein genes showing maximal transcription during oogenesis. by using transformant lines, we monitored the zygotic expression of the sry delta gene and characterized some biochemical properties of a sry delta/beta-galactosidase fusion protein-containing fingers. further analysis made use of anti-sry delta specific antibodies. during oogenesis, while sry delta mrnas transcribed by nurse cells are transferred to the oocyte starting in stage 10, translation into protein occurs in the ooplasm starting in stage 12. the maternally inherited protein concentrates in embryonic nuclei during early cleavages, prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. at the blastoderm stage, the sry delta protein is localized in all somatic nuclei. later in embryogenesis and up to the adult stage, the zygotic protein is present in nuclei of transcriptionally active cells (both somatic and germ line). these data are consistent with the sry delta protein being a transcription factor, with a role in zygotic activation of general cellular functions.

"insects use taste to evaluate food, hosts, and mates. drosophila has many ""orphan"" taste neurons that express no known taste receptors. the ionotropic receptor (ir) superfamily is best known for its role in olfaction, but virtually nothing is known about a clade of ∼35 members, the ir20a clade. here, a comprehensive analysis of this clade reveals expression in all taste organs of the fly. some members are expressed in orphan taste neurons, whereas others are coexpressed with bitter- or sugar-sensing gustatory receptor (gr) genes. analysis of the closely related ir52c and ir52d genes reveals signatures of adaptive evolution, roles in male mating behavior, and sexually dimorphic expression in neurons of the male foreleg, which contacts females during courtship. these neurons are activated by conspecific females and contact a neural circuit for sexual behavior. together, these results greatly expand the repertoire of candidate taste and pheromone receptors in the fly."

the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the drosophila melanogaster alpha 2-tubulin gene (alpha 2) has been investigated by examining the expression of an alpha 2-lacz fusion gene. when this fusion gene is introduced into the germ line by p-element mediated transformation, expression is only detected in chordotonal organs and testes. chordotonal organs, which are sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system, express the gene from late embryonic through adult stages in both males and females. testicular expression occurs from larval through adult stages and is limited to germ-line cells, the primary and secondary spermatocytes and perhaps the early spermatids.

--------------------

the wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays many important roles in animal development, tissue homeostasis and human disease. transcription factors of the tcf family mediate many wnt transcriptional responses, promoting signal-dependent activation or repression of target gene expression. the mechanism of this specificity is poorly understood. previously, we demonstrated that for activated targets in drosophila, tcf/pangolin (the fly tcf) recognizes regulatory dna through two dna binding domains, with the high mobility group (hmg) domain binding hmg sites and the adjacent c-clamp domain binding helper sites. here, we report that tcf/pangolin utilizes a similar bipartite mechanism to recognize and regulate several wnt-repressed targets, but through hmg and helper sites whose sequences are distinct from those found in activated targets. the type of hmg and helper sites is sufficient to direct activation or repression of wnt regulated cis-regulatory modules, and protease digestion studies suggest that tcf/pangolin adopts distinct conformations when bound to either hmg-helper site pair. this repressive mechanism occurs in the fly lymph gland, the larval hematopoietic organ, where wnt/β-catenin signaling controls prohemocytic differentiation. our study provides a paradigm for direct repression of target gene expression by wnt/β-catenin signaling and allosteric regulation of a transcription factor by dna.

invected (inv) and engrailed (en) form a gene complex that extends about 115 kb. these two genes encode highly related homeodomain proteins that are co-regulated in a complex manner throughout development. our dissection of inv/en regulatory dna shows that most enhancers are spread throughout a 62 kb region. we used two types of constructs to analyze the function of this dna: p-element based reporter constructs with small pieces of dna fused to the en promoter driving lacz expression and large constructs with ha-tagged en and inv inserted in the genome with the phic31 system. in addition, we generated deletions of inv and en dna in situ and assayed their effects on inv/en expression. our results support and extend our knowledge of inv/en regulation. first, inv and en share regulatory dna, most of which is flanking the en transcription unit. in support of this, a 79-kb ha-en transgene can rescue inv en double mutants to viable, fertile adults. in contrast, an 84-kb ha-inv transgene lacks most of the enhancers for inv/en expression. second, there are multiple enhancers for inv/en stripes in embryos; some of these may be redundant but others play discrete roles at different stages of embryonic development. finally, no small reporter construct gave expression in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs, a hallmark of inv/en expression. robust expression of ha-en in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs is evident from the 79-kb ha-en transgene, while a 45-kb ha-en transgene gives weaker, variable imaginal disc expression. we suggest that the activity of the imaginal disc enhancer(s) is dependent on the chromatin structure of the inv/en domain.

the t-box transcription factor tbx1 and the lim-homeodomain transcription factor islet1 are key components in regulatory circuits that generate myogenic and cardiogenic lineage diversity in chordates. we show here that org-1 and tup, the drosophila orthologs of tbx1 and islet1, are co-expressed and required for formation of the heart-associated alary muscles (ams) in the abdomen. the same holds true for lineage-related muscles in the thorax that have not been described previously, which we name thoracic alary-related muscles (tarms). lineage analyses identified the progenitor cell for each am and tarm. three-dimensional high-resolution analyses indicate that ams and tarms connect the exoskeleton to the aorta/heart and to different regions of the midgut, respectively, and surround-specific tracheal branches, pointing to an architectural role in the internal anatomy of the larva. org-1 controls tup expression in the am/tarm lineage by direct binding to two regulatory sites within an am/tarm-specific cis-regulatory module, tupame. the contributions of org-1 and tup to the specification of drosophila ams and tarms provide new insights into the transcriptional control of drosophila larval muscle diversification and highlight new parallels with gene regulatory networks involved in the specification of cardiopharyngeal mesodermal derivatives in chordates.

"in a broad variety of bilaterian species the trunk central nervous system (cns) derives from three primary rows of neuroblasts. the fates of these neural progenitor cells are determined in part by three conserved transcription factors: vnd/nkx2.2, ind/gsh and msh/msx in drosophila melanogaster/vertebrates, which are expressed in corresponding non-overlapping patterns along the dorsal-ventral axis. while this conserved suite of ""neural identity"" gene expression strongly suggests a common ancestral origin for the patterning systems, it is unclear whether the original regulatory mechanisms establishing these patterns have been similarly conserved during evolution. in drosophila, genetic evidence suggests that bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) act in a dosage-dependent fashion to repress expression of neural identity genes. bmps also play a dose-dependent role in patterning the dorsal and lateral regions of the vertebrate cns, however, the mechanism by which they achieve such patterning has not yet been clearly established. in this report, we examine the mechanisms by which bmps act on cis-regulatory modules (crms) that control localized expression of the drosophila msh and zebrafish (danio rerio) msxb in the dorsal central nervous system (cns). our analysis suggests that bmps act differently in these organisms to regulate similar patterns of gene expression in the neuroectoderm: repressing msh expression in drosophila, while activating msxb expression in the zebrafish. these findings suggest that the mechanisms by which the bmp gradient patterns the dorsal neuroectoderm have reversed since the divergence of these two ancient lineages."

there is growing evidence that activation of the notch pathway can result in consequences on cell morphogenesis and behaviour, both during embryonic development and cancer progression. in general, notch is proposed to coordinate these processes by regulating expression of key transcription factors. however, many notch-regulated genes identified in genome-wide studies are involved in fundamental aspects of cell behaviour, suggesting a more direct influence on cellular properties. by testing the functions of 25 such genes we confirmed that 12 are required in developing adult muscles, consistent with roles downstream of notch. focusing on three, reck, rhea/talin and trio, we verify their expression in adult muscle progenitors and identify notch-regulated enhancers in each. full activity of these enhancers requires functional binding sites for su(h), the dna-binding transcription factor in the notch pathway, validating their direct regulation. thus, besides its well-known roles in regulating the expression of cell-fate-determining transcription factors, notch signalling also has the potential to directly affect cell morphology and behaviour by modulating expression of genes such as reck, rhea/talin and trio. this sheds new light on the functional outputs of notch activation in morphogenetic processes.

we have analyzed the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the rh1 (ninae) gene in drosophila melanogaster by p-element-mediated germline transformation of indicator genes transcribed from mutant ninae promoter sequences. we have previously shown that a 200-bp region extending from -120 to +67 relative to the transcription start site is sufficient to obtain eye-specific expression from the ninae promoter. in the present study, 22 different 4-13-bp sequences in the -120/+67 promoter region were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. several of these sequences were found to be required for proper promoter function; two of these are conserved in the promoter of the homologous gene isolated from the related species drosophila virilis. alteration of a conserved 9-bp sequence results in aberrant, low level expression in the body. alteration of a separate 11-bp sequence, found in the promoter regions of several photoreceptor-specific genes of drosophila, results in an approximately 15-fold reduction in promoter efficiency but without apparent alteration of tissue-specificity. a protein factor capable of interacting with this 11-bp sequence has been detected by dnasei footprinting in embryonic nuclear extracts. finally, we have further characterized two separable enhancer sequences previously shown to be required for normal levels of expression from this promoter.

myogenesis of indirect flight muscles (ifms) in drosophila melanogaster follows a well-defined cellular developmental scheme. during embryogenesis, a set of cells, the adult muscle precursors (amps), are specified. these cells will become proliferating myoblasts during the larval stages which will then give rise to the adult ifms. although the cellular aspect of this developmental process is well studied, the molecular biology behind the different stages is still under investigation. in particular, the interactions required during the transition from proliferating myoblasts to differentiated myoblasts ready to fuse to the muscle fiber. it has been previously shown that the notch pathway is active in proliferating myoblasts, and that this pathway is inhibited in developing muscle fibers. furthermore, the myocyte enhancing factor 2 (mef2), vestigial (vg) and scalloped (sd) transcription factors are necessary for ifm development and that vg is required for notch pathway repression in differentiating fibers. here we examine the interactions between notch and mef2 and mechanisms by which the notch pathway is inhibited during differentiation. we show that mef2 is capable of inhibiting the notch pathway in non myogenic cells. a previous screen for mef2 potential targets identified delta a component of the notch pathway. dl is expressed in mef2 and sd-positive developing fibers. our results show that mef2 and possibly sd regulate a dl enhancer specifically expressed in the developing ifms and that mef2 is required for dl expression in developing ifms.

multicellular organisms have evolved specialized mechanisms to control transcription in a spatial and temporal manner. gene activation is tightly linked to histone acetylation on lysine residues that can be recognized by bromodomains. previously, the testis-specifically expressed bromodomain protein tbrd-1 was identified in drosophila. expression of tbrd-1 is restricted to highly transcriptionally active primary spermatocytes. tbrd-1 is essential for male fertility and proposed to act as a co-factor of testis-specific tata box binding protein-associated factors (ttafs) for testis-specific transcription. here, we performed microarray analyses to compare the transcriptomes of tbrd-1 mutant testes and wild-type testes. our data confirmed that tbrd-1 controls gene activity in male germ cells. additionally, comparing the transcriptomes of tbrd-1 and ttaf mutant testes revealed a subset of common target genes. we also characterized two new members of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (bet) family, tbrd-2 and tbrd-3. in contrast to other members of the bet family in animals, both possess only a single bromodomain, a characteristic feature of plant bet family members. immunohistology techniques not only revealed that tbrd-2 and tbrd-3 partially co-localize with tbrd-1 and ttafs in primary spermatocytes, but also that their proper subcellular distribution was impaired in tbrd-1 and ttaf mutant testes. treating cultured male germ cells with inhibitors showed that localization of tbrd-2 and tbrd-3 depends on the acetylation status within primary spermatocytes. yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitations using fly testes protein extracts demonstrated that tbrd-1 is able to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with tbrd-2, tbrd-3, and ttafs. these data reveal for the first time the existence of single bromodomain bet proteins in animals, as well as evidence for a complex containing tbrds and ttafs that regulates transcription of a subset of genes with relevance for spermiogenesis.

"a characteristic of all arthropods is the presence of flexible structures called joints that connect all leg segments. drosophila legs include two types of joints: the proximal or ""true"" joints that are motile due to the presence of muscle attachment and the distal joints that lack musculature. these joints are not only morphologically, functionally and evolutionarily different, but also the morphogenetic program that forms them is distinct. development of both proximal and distal joints requires notch activity; however, it is still unknown how this pathway can control the development of such homologous although distinct structures. here we show that the bhlh-pas transcription factor encoded by the gene dysfusion (dys), is expressed and absolutely required for tarsal joint development while it is dispensable for proximal joints. in the presumptive tarsal joints, dys regulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes reaper and head involution defective and the expression of the rhogtpases modulators, rhogef2 and rhogap71e, thus directing key morphogenetic events required for tarsal joint development. when ectopically expressed, dys is able to induce some aspects of the morphogenetic program necessary for distal joint development such as fold formation and programmed cell death. this novel dys function depends on its obligated partner tango to activate the transcription of target genes. we also identified a dedicated dys cis-regulatory module that regulates dys expression in the tarsal presumptive leg joints through direct su(h) binding. all these data place dys as a key player downstream of notch, directing distal versus proximal joint morphogenesis."

"transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (crms), or enhancers, are responsible for directing gene expression in specific territories and cell types during development. in some instances, the same gene may be served by two or more enhancers with similar specificities. here we show that the utilization of dual, or ""shadow"", enhancers is a common feature of genes that are active specifically in neural precursor (np) cells in drosophila. by genome-wide computational discovery of statistically significant clusters of binding motifs for both proneural activator (p) proteins and basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) repressor (r) factors (a ""p+r"" regulatory code), we have identified np-specific enhancer modules associated with multiple genes expressed in this cell type. these crms are distinct from those previously identified for the corresponding gene, establishing the existence of a dual-enhancer arrangement in which both modules reside close to the gene they serve. using wild-type and mutant reporter gene constructs in vivo, we show that p sites in these modules mediate activation by proneural factors in ""proneural cluster"" territories, whereas r sites mediate repression by bhlh repressors, which serves to restrict expression specifically to np cells. to our knowledge, our results identify the first direct targets of these bhlh repressors. finally, using genomic rescue constructs for neuralized (neur), we demonstrate that each of the gene's two np-specific enhancers is sufficient to rescue neur function in the lateral inhibition process by which adult sensory organ precursor (sop) cells are specified, but that deletion of both enhancers results in failure of this event."

spermatogenesis is accompanied by a remarkable reorganization of the chromatin in post-meiotic stages, characterized by a near genome-wide displacement of histones by protamines and a transient expression of transition proteins. in drosophila, the transition-protein-like protein tpl94d contains an hmg-box domain and is expressed during chromatin reorganization. here, we searched for additional hmg-box-containing proteins with a similar expression pattern. we identified two proteins specifically expressed in the testis, thmg-1 and thmg-2, whose expression levels were highest during the histone-to-protamine transition. protein-protein interaction studies revealed that thmg-1 and thmg-2 form heterodimers in vivo. we demonstrated that tpl94d, thmg-1 and thmg-2 localize to chromatin of the male germ line, with the most abundant levels observed during post-meiotic chromatin reorganization. analysis of a tpl94d mutant showed that the c-terminal region of tpl94d is dispensable for fertility. these data strongly suggested either that the truncated protein, which still contains the n-terminal hmg-box domain, is functional or that other proteins act in functional redundancy with tpl94d during spermiogenesis. a thmg-1/thmg-2 null mutant also had no detectable specific phenotype, but hmgz, which encodes the major somatic hmg-box-containing protein hmgz, was transcriptionally up-regulated. our results showed that drosophila spermatogenesis is characterized by continuous and overlapping expression of different hmg-box-containing proteins. we hypothesize that the mechanism of chromatin reorganization is a process highly secured by redundancies.

in animals, hox transcription factors define regional identity in distinct anatomical domains. how hox genes encode this specificity is a paradox, because different hox proteins bind with high affinity in vitro to similar dna sequences. here, we demonstrate that the hox protein ultrabithorax (ubx) in complex with its cofactor extradenticle (exd) bound specifically to clusters of very low affinity sites in enhancers of the shavenbaby gene of drosophila. these low affinity sites conferred specificity for ubx binding in vivo, but multiple clustered sites were required for robust expression when embryos developed in variable environments. although most individual ubx binding sites are not evolutionarily conserved, the overall enhancer architecture-clusters of low affinity binding sites-is maintained and required for enhancer function. natural selection therefore works at the level of the enhancer, requiring a particular density of low affinity ubx sites to confer both specific and robust expression.

"hunchback (hb) is a bifunctional transcription factor that activates and represses distinct enhancers. here, we investigate the hypothesis that hb can activate and repress the same enhancer. computational models predicted that hb bifunctionally regulates the even-skipped (eve) stripe 3+7 enhancer (eve3+7) in drosophila blastoderm embryos. we measured and modeled eve expression at cellular resolution under multiple genetic perturbations and found that the eve3+7 enhancer could not explain endogenous eve stripe 7 behavior. instead, we found that eve stripe 7 is controlled by two enhancers: the canonical eve3+7 and a sequence encompassing the minimal eve stripe 2 enhancer (eve2+7). hb bifunctionally regulates eve stripe 7, but it executes these two activities on different pieces of regulatory dna--it activates the eve2+7 enhancer and represses the eve3+7 enhancer. these two ""shadow enhancers"" use different regulatory logic to create the same pattern."

the e proteins and id proteins are, respectively, the positive and negative heterodimer partners for the basic-helix-loop-helix protein family and as such contribute to a remarkably large number of cell-fate decisions. e proteins and id proteins also function to inhibit or promote cell proliferation and cancer. using a genetic modifier screen in drosophila, we show that the id protein extramacrochaetae enables growth by suppressing activation of the salvador-warts-hippo pathway of tumor suppressors, activation that requires transcriptional activation of the expanded gene by the e protein daughterless. daughterless protein binds to an intronic enhancer in the expanded gene, both activating the swh pathway independently of the transmembrane protein crumbs and bypassing the negative feedback regulation that targets the same expanded enhancer. thus, the salvador-warts-hippo pathway has a cell-autonomous function to prevent inappropriate differentiation due to transcription factor imbalance and monitors the intrinsic developmental status of progenitor cells, distinct from any responses to cell-cell interactions.

orcokinins are neuropeptides that have been identified in diverse arthropods. in some species, an orcokinin gene encodes two isoforms of mature orcokinin peptide through alternative mrna splicing. the existence of two orcokinin isoforms was predicted in drosophila melanogaster as well, but the expression pattern of both isoforms has not been characterized. here, we use in situ hybridization, antibody staining, and enhancer fusion gal4 transgenic flies to examine the expression patterns of the a and b forms of orcokinin, and provide evidence that they are expressed differentially in the central nervous system (cns) and the intestinal enteroendocrine system. the orcokinin a isoform is mainly expressed in the cns of both larvae and adults. the a form is expressed in 5 pairs of neurons in abdominal neuromeres 1-5 of the larval cns. in the adult brain, the a form is expressed in one pair of neurons in the posteriorlateral protocerebrum, and an additional four pairs of neurons located near the basement of the accessory medulla. orcokinin a expression is also observed in two pairs of neurons in the ventral nerve cord (vnc). the orcokinin b form is mainly expressed in intestinal enteroendocrine cells in the larva and adult, with additional expression in one unpaired neuron in the adult abdominal ganglion. together, our results provide elucidation of the existence and differential expression of the two orcokinin isoforms in the drosophila brain and gut, setting the stage for future functional studies of orcokinins utilizing the genetically amenable fly model.

here we used discriminative training methods to uncover the chromatin, transcription factor (tf) binding and sequence features of enhancers underlying gene expression in individual cardiac cells. we used machine learning with tf motifs and chip data for a core set of cardiogenic tfs and histone modifications to classify drosophila cell-type-specific cardiac enhancer activity. we show that the classifier models can be used to predict cardiac cell subtype cis-regulatory activities. associating the predicted enhancers with an expression atlas of cardiac genes further uncovered clusters of genes with transcription and function limited to individual cardiac cell subtypes. further, the cell-specific enhancer models revealed chromatin, tf binding and sequence features that distinguish enhancer activities in distinct subsets of heart cells. collectively, our results show that computational modeling combined with empirical testing provides a powerful platform to uncover the enhancers, tf motifs and gene expression profiles which characterize individual cardiac cell fates.

cell death is a prevalent, well-controlled and fundamental aspect of development, particularly in the nervous system. in drosophila, specific neural stem cells are eliminated by apoptosis during embryogenesis. in the absence of apoptosis, these stem cells continue to divide, resulting in a dramatically hyperplastic central nervous system and adult lethality. although core cell death pathways have been well described, the spatial, temporal and cell identity cues that activate the cell death machinery in specific cells are largely unknown. we identified a cis-regulatory region that controls the transcription of the cell death activators reaper, grim and sickle exclusively in neural stem cells. using a reporter generated from this regulatory region, we found that notch activity is required for neural stem cell death. notch regulates the expression of the abdominala homeobox protein, which provides important spatial cues for death. importantly, we show that pro-apoptotic notch signaling is activated by the delta ligand expressed on the neighboring progeny of the stem cell. thus we identify a previously undescribed role for progeny in regulating the proper developmental death of their parental stem cells.

"we have used a transient expression assay employing drosophila tissue culture cells to study the potential of several drosophila homeobox proteins to function as transcriptional regulators. a 96 bp fragment from the promoter region of the segment polarity gene engrailed, previously shown to contain five copies of a 10 bp consensus binding site for these proteins, enhanced transcription in the presence, but not the absence, of several different homeobox protein expression vectors. it is interesting that cotransfection with combinations of expression vectors encoding the homeobox proteins fushi tarazu, paired, and/or zen resulted in substantial synergistic increases in expression. in contrast, the products of the even-skipped and engrailed genes were found to repress, or quench, the activation induced by the other proteins. we discuss the implications of these results with respect to the role of homeobox genes in the control of embryonic development, and propose a ""multi-switch"" model whereby the activity of a target gene depends on the interactions of different homeobox proteins with multiple copies of a common binding site."

only few examples of transdifferentiation, which denotes the conversion of one differentiated cell type to another, are known to occur during normal development, and more often, it is associated with regeneration processes. with respect to muscles, dedifferentiation/redifferentiation processes have been documented during post-traumatic muscle regeneration in blastema of newts as well as during myocardial regeneration. as shown herein, the ventral longitudinal muscles of the adult drosophila heart arise from specific larval alary muscles in a process that represents the first known example of syncytial muscle transdifferentiation via dedifferentiation into mononucleate myoblasts during normal development. we demonstrate that this unique process depends on the reinitiation of a transcriptional program previously employed for embryonic alary muscle development, in which the factors org-1 (drosophila tbx1) and tailup (drosophila islet1) are key components. during metamorphosis, the action of these factors is combined with cell-autonomous inputs from the ecdysone steroid and the hox gene ultrabithorax, which provide temporal and spatial specificity to the transdifferentiation events. following muscle dedifferentiation, inductive cues, particularly from the remodeling heart tube, are required for the redifferentiation of myoblasts into ventral longitudinal muscles. our results provide new insights into mechanisms of lineage commitment and cell-fate plasticity during development.

"""regulatory evolution,"" that is, changes in a gene's expression pattern through changes at its regulatory sequence, rather than changes at the coding sequence of the gene or changes of the upstream transcription factors, has been increasingly recognized as a pervasive evolution mechanism. many somatic sexually dimorphic features of drosophila melanogaster are the results of gene expression regulated by the doublesex (dsx) gene, which encodes sex-specific transcription factors (dsx(f) in females and dsx(m) in males). rapid changes in such sexually dimorphic features are likely a result of changes at the regulatory sequence of the target genes. we focused on the flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (fmo-2) gene, a likely direct dsx target, to elucidate how sexually dimorphic expression and its evolution are brought about. we found that dsx is deployed to regulate the fmo-2 transcription both in the midgut and in fat body cells of the spermatheca (a female-specific tissue), through a canonical dsx-binding site in the fmo-2 regulatory sequence. in the melanogaster group, fmo-2 transcription in the midgut has evolved rapidly, in contrast to the conserved spermathecal transcription. we identified two cis-regulatory modules (crm-p and crm-d) that direct sexually monomorphic or dimorphic fmo-2 transcription, respectively, in the midguts of these species. changes of fmo-2 transcription in the midgut from sexually dimorphic to sexually monomorphic in some species are caused by the loss of crm-d function, but not the loss of the canonical dsx-binding site. thus, conferring transcriptional regulation on a crm level allows the regulation to evolve rapidly in one tissue while evading evolutionary constraints posed by other tissues."

the bicoid (bcd) protein is expressed in an anteroposterior gradient in early drosophila embryos and controls the zygotic activation of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) in a broad but precisely bounded anterior domain. here we show that the hb gene contains multiple regulatory elements that mediate transcriptional activation in response to bcd protein. further, we demonstrate that the resulting patterns of expression in vivo depend critically on both the bcd gradient profile and the number and quality of these hb elements. finally, we show that these same elements mediate bcd-dependent transcriptional activation in yeast and that this interaction requires distinct dna binding and activating regions in the bcd protein. our results argue that bcd protein normally binds and activates the hb gene in a concentration-dependent fashion, thereby allowing the gradient of bcd protein to dictate where the hb gene is initially turned on in early embryos. they also suggest that the bcd gradient has the instructive capacity to activate other subordinate control genes by the same mechanism, each in a distinct spatial domain according to its affinity for bcd protein.

even-skipped (eve) is a homeodomain-encoding gene that is a genetically defined repressor of ultrabithorax (ubx), fushi-tarazu (ftz), and wingless (wg). here we report that purified eve protein represses transcription in vitro at the ubx promoter, in a dna binding site-dependent manner. eve protein represses transcription when bound either upstream or downstream of the rna start site or when dna binding sites are in either orientation. we also show that eve represses expression from the ubx promoter in drosophila tissue culture cells, again in a binding site-dependent manner. deletion of eve dna binding sites does not alter transcription in the absence of eve, and so repression is not likely to be the result of eve competitively inhibiting an activator protein from binding to the same dna element. instead, we propose that eve protein is probably interfering with the function of proteins bound at other locations in the promoter. the biochemical demonstration that a drosophila homeodomain protein can directly regulate rna synthesis strengthens the view that this class of regulators act as transcription factors to control development.

understanding the regulatory circuitry controlling myogenesis is critical to understanding developmental mechanisms and developmentally-derived diseases. we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of a drosophila myogenic repressor gene, holes in muscles (him). previously, him was shown to inhibit myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) activity, and is expressed in myoblasts but not differentiating myotubes. we demonstrate that different phases of him embryonic expression arises through the actions of different enhancers, and we characterize the enhancer required for its early mesoderm expression. this him early mesoderm enhancer contains two conserved binding sites for the basic helix-loop-helix regulator twist, and one binding site for the nk homeodomain protein tinman. the sites for both proteins are required for enhancer activity in early embryos. twist and tinman activate the enhancer in tissue culture assays, and ectopic expression of either factor is sufficient to direct ectopic expression of a him-lacz reporter, or of the endogenous him gene. moreover, sustained expression of twist in the mesoderm up-regulates mesodermal him expression in late embryos. our findings provide a model to define mechanistically how twist can both promotes myogenesis through direct activation of mef2, and can place a brake on myogenesis, through direct activation of him.

bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) signal by activating smad transcription factors to control a number of decisions during animal development. in drosophila, signaling by the bmp ligand decapentaplegic (dpp) involves the activity of brinker (brk) which, in most contexts, is repressed by dpp. brk encodes a transcription factor which represses bmp signaling output by antagonizing smad-dependent target gene activation. here, we study bmp-dependent gene regulation during drosophila oogenesis by following the signal transmission from dpp to its target broad (br), a gene with a crucial function in eggshell patterning. we identify regulatory sequences that account for expression of both brk and br, and connect these to the transcription factors of the pathway. we show that dpp directly regulates brk transcription through smad- and schnurri (shn)-dependent repression. brk is epistatic to dpp in br expression and activates br indirectly, through removal of a repressor, which is yet to be identified. our work provides first cis-regulatory insights into transcriptional interpretation of bmp signaling in eggshell morphogenesis and defines a transcriptional cascade that connects dpp to target gene regulation.

a drosophila pair-rule segmentation gene, fushi tarazu (ftz), encodes a protein which is expressed in a characteristic seven-stripe pattern. the promoter sequences that are sufficient for generating this spatially restricted pattern of expression are located within 669 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. multiple transcriptional activators and repressors interact with this 'zebra-stripe' promoter unit to bring about the positional specificity of ftz transcription. here we report that the homoeodomain-containing protein encoded by caudal (cad) is one such regulator. the cad gene product can increase the level of ftz transcription in the posterior half of the embryo by interacting with multiple copies of a tttatg consensus sequence located in the zebra-stripe unit. this result demonstrates one pathway by which the product of a maternally expressed segmentation gene, expressed in an antero-posterior concentration gradient, can directly regulate the expression of a pair-rule gene.

the success of insects is linked to their impressive tolerance to environmental stress, but little is known about how such responses are mediated by the neuroendocrine system. here we show that the capability (capa) neuropeptide gene is a desiccation- and cold stress-responsive gene in diverse dipteran species. using targeted in vivo gene silencing, physiological manipulations, stress-tolerance assays, and rationally designed neuropeptide analogs, we demonstrate that the drosophila melanogaster capa neuropeptide gene and its encoded peptides alter desiccation and cold tolerance. knockdown of the capa gene increases desiccation tolerance but lengthens chill coma recovery time, and injection of capa peptide analogs can reverse both phenotypes. immunohistochemical staining suggests that capa accumulates in the capa-expressing va neurons during desiccation and nonlethal cold stress but is not released until recovery from each stress. our results also suggest that regulation of cellular ion and water homeostasis mediated by capa peptide signaling in the insect malpighian (renal) tubules is a key physiological mechanism during recovery from desiccation and cold stress. this work augments our understanding of how stress tolerance is mediated by neuroendocrine signaling and illustrates the use of rationally designed peptide analogs as agents for disrupting protective stress tolerance.

spatially regulated expression of the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) in the visceral mesoderm can be mimicked in transformed drosophila embryos by expression of a ubx--beta-galactosidase fusion gene. here we show that a proximal homeoprotien binding sequence downstream of the ubx transcription start site, the b element, is required for this pattern. a distal upstream ubx sequence, but not the b element, is sufficient to confer the pattern if linked to an hsp70 tata box in a heterologous construct. the pattern in this case requires ubx function, like endogenous ubx expression in the visceral mesoderm, suggesting that the distal upstream sequence contains an important target sequence for autoregulation. we propose that the b element, in the context of the ubx promoter, functions to mediate enhancer function of the distal sequence. thus, the visceral mesoderm pattern requires coordinate action of a proximal and a distal regulatory element.

cell-matrix adhesion is essential for building animals, promoting tissue cohesion, and enabling cells to migrate and resist mechanical force. talin is an intracellular protein that is critical for linking integrin extracellular-matrix receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. a key question raised by structure-function studies is whether talin, which is critical for all integrin-mediated adhesion, acts in the same way in every context. we show that distinct combinations of talin domains are required for each of three different integrin functions during drosophila development. the partial function of some mutant talins requires vinculin, indicating that recruitment of vinculin allows talin to duplicate its own activities. the different requirements are best explained by alternative mechanisms of talin function, with talin using one or both of its integrin-binding sites. we confirmed these alternatives by showing that the proximity between the second integrin-binding site and integrins differs, suggesting that talin adopts different orientations relative to integrins. finally, we show that vinculin and actomyosin activity help change talin's orientation. these findings demonstrate that the mechanism of talin function differs in each developmental context examined. the different arrangements of the talin molecule relative to integrins suggest that talin is able to sense different force vectors, either parallel or perpendicular to the membrane. this provides a paradigm for proteins whose apparent uniform function is in fact achieved by a variety of distinct mechanisms involving different molecular architectures.

odor perception requires that each olfactory sensory neuron (osn) class continuously express a single odorant receptor (or) regardless of changes in the environment. however, little is known about the control of the robust, class-specific or expression involved. here, we investigate the cis-regulatory mechanisms and components that generate robust and osn class-specific or expression in drosophila. our results demonstrate that the spatial restriction of expression to a single osn class is directed by clusters of transcription-factor dna binding motifs. our dissection of motif clusters of differing complexity demonstrates that structural components such as motif overlap and motif order integrate transcription factor combinations and chromatin status to form a spatially restricted pattern. we further demonstrate that changes in metabolism or temperature perturb the function of complex clusters. we show that the cooperative regulation between motifs around and within the cluster generates robust, class-specific or expression.

in drosophila, myoblast fusion is a conserved process in which founder cells (fcs) and fusion competent myoblasts (fcms) fuse to form a syncytial muscle fiber. mutants for the myogenic regulator myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2) show a failure of myoblast fusion, indicating that mef2 regulates the fusion process. indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that several genes involved in myoblast fusion are bound by mef2 during embryogenesis. of these, the marvel domain gene singles bar (sing), is down-regulated in mef2 knockdown pupae, and has five consensus mef2 binding sites within a 9000-bp region. to determine if mef2 is an essential and direct regulator of sing during pupal muscle development, we identified a 315-bp myoblast enhancer of sing. this enhancer was active during myoblast fusion, and mutation of two mef2 sites significantly decreased enhancer activity. we show that lack of sing expression resulted in adult lethality and muscle loss, due to a failure of fusion during the pupal stage. additionally, we sought to determine if sing was required in either fcs or fcms to support fusion. interestingly, knockdown of sing in either population did not significantly affect fusion, however, knockdown in both fcs and fcms resulted in muscles with significantly reduced nuclei numbers, provisionally indicating that sing function is required in either cell type, but not both. finally, we found that mef2 regulated sing expression at the embryonic stage through the same 315-bp enhancer, indicating that sing is a mef2 target at both critical stages of myoblast fusion. our studies define for the first time how mef2 directly controls fusion at multiple stages of the life cycle, and provide further evidence that the mechanisms of fusion characterized in drosophila embryos is also used in the formation of the more complex adult muscles.

the origination and diversification of morphological characteristics represents a key problem in understanding the evolution of development. morphological traits result from gene regulatory networks (grns) that form a web of transcription factors, which regulate multiple cis-regulatory element (cre) sequences to control the coordinated expression of differentiation genes. the formation and modification of grns must ultimately be understood at the level of individual regulatory linkages (i.e., transcription factor binding sites within cres) that constitute the network. here, we investigate how elements within a network originated and diversified to generate a broad range of abdominal pigmentation phenotypes among sophophora fruit flies. our data indicates that the coordinated expression of two melanin synthesis enzymes, yellow and tan, recently evolved through novel cre activities that respond to the spatial patterning inputs of hox proteins and the sex-specific input of bric-à-brac transcription factors. once established, it seems that these newly evolved activities were repeatedly modified by evolutionary changes in the network's trans-regulators to generate large-scale changes in pigment pattern. by elucidating how yellow and tan are connected to the web of abdominal trans-regulators, we discovered that the yellow and tan abdominal cres are composed of distinct regulatory inputs that exhibit contrasting responses to the same hox proteins and hox cofactors. these results provide an example in which cre origination underlies a recently evolved novel trait, and highlights how coordinated expression patterns can evolve in parallel through the generation of unique regulatory linkages.

the selector gene apterous (ap) plays a key role during the development of the drosophila melanogaster wing because it governs the establishment of the dorsal-ventral (d-v) compartment boundary. the d-v compartment boundary is known to serve as an important signaling center that is essential for the growth of the wing. the role of ap and its downstream effectors have been studied extensively. however, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ap during wing disc development. in this study, we present a first characterization of an essential wing-specific ap enhancer. first, we defined an 874-bp fragment about 10 kb upstream of the ap transcription start that faithfully recapitulates the expression pattern of ap in the wing imaginal disc. analysis of deletions in the ap locus covering this element demonstrated that it is essential for proper regulation of ap and formation of the wing. moreover, we showed that the mutations ap(blot) and ap(xasta) directly affect the integrity of this enhancer, leading to characteristic wing phenotypes. furthermore, we engineered an in situ rescue system at the endogenous ap gene locus, allowing us to investigate the role of enhancer fragments in their native environment. using this system, we were able to demonstrate that the essential wing enhancer alone is not sufficient for normal wing development. the in situ rescue system will allow us to characterize the ap regulatory sequences in great detail at the endogenous locus.

how the highly stereotyped morphologies of individual neurons are genetically specified is not well understood. we identify six transcription factors (tfs) expressed in a combinatorial manner in seven post-mitotic adult leg motor neurons (mns) that are derived from a single neuroblast in drosophila. unlike tfs expressed in mitotically active neuroblasts, these tfs do not regulate each other's expression. removing the activity of a single tf resulted in specific morphological defects, including muscle targeting and dendritic arborization, and in a highly specific walking defect in adult flies. in contrast, when the expression of multiple tfs was modified, nearly complete transformations in mn morphologies were generated. these results show that the morphological characteristics of a single neuron are dictated by a combinatorial code of morphology tfs (mtfs). mtfs function at a previously unidentified regulatory tier downstream of factors acting in the nb but independently of factors that act in terminally differentiated neurons.

to understand development we need to understand how transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are employed to confer different cell types with their unique properties. nonetheless it is also critical to understand how such mechanisms are used to confer different cell types with common cellular properties, such as the ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix. to decode how adhesion is regulated in cells stemming from different pedigrees we analyzed the regulatory region that drives the expression of dei, which is a transcription factor that serves as a central determinant of cell adhesion, particularly by inducing expression of βps-integrin. we show that activation of dei transcription is mediated through multiple cis regulatory modules, each driving transcription in a spatially and temporally restricted fashion. thus the dei gene provides a molecular platform through which cell adhesion can be regulated at the transcriptional level in different cellular milieus. moreover, we show that these regulatory modules respond, often directly, to central regulators of cell identity in each of the dei-expressing cell types, such as d-mef2 in muscle cells, stripe in tendon cells and blistered in wing intervein cells. these findings suggest that the acquirement of common cellular properties shared by different cell types is embedded within the unique differentiation program dictated to each of these cells by the major determinants of its identity.

stem cell self-renewal versus differentiation is regulated by the niche, which provides localized molecules that favor self-renewal. in the drosophila melanogaster female germline stem cell (gsc) niche, decapentaplegic (dpp), a fly transforming growth factor β molecule and well-established long-range morphogen, acts over one cell diameter to maintain the gscs. here, we show that thickveins (tkv; a type i receptor of dpp) is highly expressed in stromal cells next to dpp-producing cells and functions to remove excess dpp outside the niche, thereby spatially restricting its activity. interestingly, tkv expression in these stromal cells is regulated by multiple wnt ligands that are produced by the niche. our data demonstrate a self-restraining mechanism by which the drosophila ovarian gsc niche acts to define its own boundary.

changes in gene expression during animal development are largely responsible for the evolution of morphological diversity. however, the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the origins of new gene-expression domains have been difficult to elucidate. here, we sought to identify molecular events underlying the origins of three novel features of wingless (wg) gene expression that are associated with distinct pigmentation patterns in drosophila guttifera. we compared the activity of cis-regulatory sequences (enhancers) across the wg locus in d. guttifera and drosophila melanogaster and found strong functional conservation among the enhancers that control similar patterns of wg expression in larval imaginal discs that are essential for appendage development. for pupal tissues, however, we found three novel wg enhancer activities in d. guttifera associated with novel domains of wg expression, including two enhancers located surprisingly far away in an intron of the distant wnt10 gene. detailed analysis of one enhancer (the vein-tip enhancer) revealed that it overlapped with a region controlling wg expression in wing crossveins (crossvein enhancer) in d. guttifera and other species. our results indicate that one novel domain of wg expression in d. guttifera wings evolved by co-opting pre-existing regulatory sequences governing gene activity in the developing wing. we suggest that the modification of existing enhancers is a common path to the evolution of new gene-expression domains and enhancers.

the v-atpase is a fundamental eukaryotic enzyme that is central to cellular homeostasis. although its impact on key metabolic regulators such as torc1 is well documented, our knowledge of mechanisms that regulate v-atpase activity is limited. here, we report that the drosophila transcription factor mitf is a master regulator of this holoenzyme. mitf directly controls transcription of all 15 v-atpase components through m-box cis-sites and this coordinated regulation affects holoenzyme activity in vivo. in addition, through the v-atpase, mitf promotes the activity of torc1, which in turn negatively regulates mitf. we provide evidence that mitf, v-atpase and torc1 form a negative regulatory loop that maintains each of these important metabolic regulators in relative balance. interestingly, direct regulation of v-atpase genes by human mitf also occurs in cells of the melanocytic lineage, showing mechanistic conservation in the regulation of the v-atpase by mitf family proteins in fly and mammals. collectively, this evidence points to an ancient module comprising mitf, v-atpase and torc1 that serves as a dynamic modulator of metabolism for cellular homeostasis.

zerknüllt (zen) is one of approximately 10 zygotically active genes that control the differentiation of the dorsal-ventral (d/v) pattern during early embryogenesis in drosophila. past genetic analyses suggest that maternal factors repress the expression of zen in ventral regions, thereby restricting zen products to dorsal and dorsal-lateral regions of precellular embryos. subsequent interactions with other zygotic d/v regulatory genes refine the zen pattern, restricting expression to the dorsal-most ectoderm. here we describe the use of zen promoter fusions and p-element transformation to identify cis elements that are responsible for the complex spatial pattern of zen expression. the zen promoter shows a two-tier organization: distal sequences mediate its initial response to maternal factors, whereas proximal sequences are responsible for the refinement of the pattern in older embryos. the distal regulatory element has the property of a silencer (or anti-enhancer) element and can act over a distance to repress ventral expression of a heterologous promoter. also, we discuss evidence that proximal promoter sequences interact with factors that may be modulated by a cell-cell communication pathway.

collier, the single drosophila coe (collier/ebf/olf-1) transcription factor, is required in several developmental processes, including head patterning and specification of muscle and neuron identity during embryogenesis. to identify direct collier (col) targets in different cell types, we used chip-seq to map col binding sites throughout the genome, at mid-embryogenesis. in vivo col binding peaks were associated to 415 potential direct target genes. gene ontology analysis revealed a strong enrichment in proteins with dna binding and/or transcription-regulatory properties. characterization of a selection of candidates, using transgenic crm-reporter assays, identified direct col targets in dorso-lateral somatic muscles and specific neuron types in the central nervous system. these data brought new evidence that col direct control of the expression of the transcription regulators apterous and eyes-absent (eya) is critical to specifying neuronal identities. they also showed that cross-regulation between col and eya in muscle progenitor cells is required for specification of muscle identity, revealing a new parallel between the myogenic regulatory networks operating in drosophila and vertebrates. col regulation of eya, both in specific muscle and neuronal lineages, may illustrate one mechanism behind the evolutionary diversification of col biological roles.

expression of the mads domain transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (mef2) is regulated by numerous and overlapping enhancers which tightly control its transcription in the mesoderm. to understand how mef2 expression is controlled in the heart, we identified a late stage mef2 cardiac enhancer that is active in all heart cells beginning at stage 14 of embryonic development. this enhancer is regulated by the nk-homeodomain transcription factor tinman, and the gata transcription factor pannier through both direct and indirect interactions with the enhancer. since tinman, pannier and mef2 are evolutionarily conserved from drosophila to vertebrates, and since their vertebrate homologs can convert mouse fibroblast cells to cardiomyocytes in different activator cocktails, we tested whether over-expression of these three factors in vivo could ectopically activate known cardiac marker genes. we found that mesodermal over-expression of tinman and pannier resulted in approximately 20% of embryos with ectopic hand and sulphonylurea receptor (sur) expression. by adding mef2 alongside tinman and pannier, a dramatic expansion in the expression of hand and sur was observed in almost all embryos analyzed. two additional cardiac markers were also expanded in their expression. our results demonstrate the ability to initiate ectopic cardiac fate in vivo by the combination of only three members of the conserved drosophila cardiac transcription network, and provide an opportunity for this genetic model system to be used to dissect the mechanisms of cardiac specification.

"organogenesis is controlled by gene networks activated by upstream selector genes. during development the gene network is activated stepwise, with a sequential deployment of successive transcription factors and signalling molecules that modify the interaction of the elements of the network as the organ forms. very little is known about the steps leading from the early specification of the cells that form the organ primordium to the moment when a robust gene network is in place. here we study in detail how a hox protein induces during early embryogenesis a simple organogenetic cascade that matures into a complex gene network through the activation of feedback and feed forward interaction loops. to address how the network organization changes during development and how the target genes integrate the genetic information it provides, we analyze in drosophila the induction of posterior spiracle organogenesis by the hox gene abdominal-b (abd-b). initially, abd-b activates in the spiracle primordium a cascade of transcription factors and signalling molecules including the jak/stat signalling pathway. we find that at later stages stat activity feeds back directly into abd-b, initiating the transformation of the hox cascade into a gene-network. focusing on crumbs, a spiracle downstream target gene of abd-b, we analyze how a modular cis regulatory element integrates the dynamic network information set by abd-b and the jak/stat signalling pathway during development. we describe how a hox induced genetic cascade transforms into a robust gene network during organogenesis due to the repeated interaction of abd-b and one of its targets, the jak/stat signalling cascade. our results show that in this network stat functions not just as a direct transcription factor, but also acts as a ""counter-repressor"", uncovering a novel mode for stat directed transcriptional regulation."

the shadow enhancer of the short gastrulation (sog) gene directs its sequential expression in the neurogenic ectoderm and the ventral midline of the developing drosophila embryo. here, we characterize three unusual features of the shadow enhancer midline activity. first, the minimal regions for the two different enhancer activities exhibit high overlap within the shadow enhancer, meaning that one developmental enhancer possesses dual enhancer activities. second, the midline enhancer activity relies on five single-minded (sim)-binding sites, two of which have not been found in any sim target enhancers. finally, two linked dorsal (dl)- and zelda (zld)-binding sites, critical for the neurogenic ectoderm enhancer activity, are also required for the midline enhancer activity. these results suggest that early activation by dl and zld may facilitate late activation via the noncanonical sites occupied by sim. we discuss a model for zld as a pioneer factor and speculate its role in midline enhancer activity.

insects use a spectacular variety of chemical signals to guide their social behaviours. how such chemical diversity arises is a long-standing problem in evolutionary biology. here we describe the contribution of the fatty acid elongase bond to both pheromone diversity and male fertility in drosophila. genetic manipulation and mass spectrometry analysis reveal that the loss of bond eliminates the male sex pheromone (3r,11z,19z)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (ch503). unexpectedly, silencing bond expression severely suppresses male fertility and the fertility of conspecific rivals. these deficits are rescued on ectopic expression of bond in the male reproductive system. a comparative analysis across six drosophila species shows that the gain of a novel transcription initiation site is correlated with bond expression in the ejaculatory bulb, a primary site of male pheromone production. taken together, these results indicate that modification of cis-regulatory elements and subsequent changes in gene expression pattern is one mechanism by which pheromone diversity arises.

background: one of the major challenges in developmental biology is to understand the regulatory events that generate neuronal diversity. during drosophila embryonic neural lineage development, cellular temporal identity is established in part by a transcription factor (tf) regulatory network that mediates a cascade of cellular identity decisions. two of the regulators essential to this network are the pou-domain tfs nubbin and pdm-2, encoded by adjacent genes collectively known as pdm. the focus of this study is the discovery and characterization of cis-regulatory dna that governs their expression. results: phylogenetic footprinting analysis of a 125 kb genomic region that spans the pdm locus identified 116 conserved sequence clusters. to determine which of these regions function as cis-regulatory enhancers that regulate the dynamics of pdm gene expression, we tested each for in vivo enhancer activity during embryonic development and postembryonic neurogenesis. our screen revealed 77 unique enhancers positioned throughout the noncoding region of the pdm locus. many of these activated neural-specific gene expression during different developmental stages and many drove expression in overlapping patterns. sequence comparisons of functionally related enhancers that activate overlapping expression patterns revealed that they share conserved elements that can be predictive of enhancer behavior. to facilitate data accessibility, the results of our analysis are catalogued in cispatterns, an online database of the structure and function of these and other drosophila enhancers. conclusions: these studies reveal a diversity of modular enhancers that most likely regulate pdm gene expression during embryonic and adult development, highlighting a high level of temporal and spatial expression specificity. in addition, we discovered clusters of functionally related enhancers throughout the pdm locus. a subset of these enhancers share conserved elements including sequences that correspond to known tf dna binding sites. although comparative analysis of the nubbin and pdm-2 encoding sequences indicate that these two genes most likely arose from a duplication event, we found only partial evidence of sequence duplication between their enhancers, suggesting that after the putative duplication their cis-regulatory dna diverged at a higher rate than their coding sequences.

the subdivision of cell populations in compartments is a key event during animal development. in drosophila, the gene apterous (ap) divides the wing imaginal disc in dorsal vs ventral cell lineages and is required for wing formation. ap function as a dorsal selector gene has been extensively studied. however, the regulation of its expression during wing development is poorly understood. in this study, we analyzed ap transcriptional regulation at the endogenous locus and identified three cis-regulatory modules (crms) essential for wing development. only when the three crms are combined, robust ap expression is obtained. in addition, we genetically and molecularly analyzed the trans-factors that regulate these crms. our results propose a three-step mechanism for the cell lineage compartment expression of ap that includes initial activation, positive autoregulation and trithorax-mediated maintenance through separable crms.

the drosophila tbx20 homologs midline and h15 act as selector genes for ventral fate in drosophila legs. midline and h15 expression defines the ventral domain of the leg and the two genes are necessary and sufficient for the development of ventral fate. ventral-specific expression of midline and h15 is activated by wingless (wg) and repressed by decapentaplegic (dpp). here we identify vle, a 5 kb enhancer that drives ventral specific expression in the leg disc that is very similar to midline expression. subdivision of vle identifies two regions that mediate both activation and repression and third region that only mediates repression. loss- and gain-of-function genetic mosaic analysis shows that the activating and repressing regions respond to wg and dpp signaling respectively. all three repression regions depend on the activity of mothers-against-decapentaplegic, a drosophila r-smad that mediates dpp signaling, and respond to ectopic expression of the dpp target genes optomoter-blind and dorsocross 3. however, only one repression region is responsive to loss of schnurri, a co-repressor required for direct repression by dpp-signaling. thus, dpp signaling restricts midline expression through both direct repression and through the activation of downstream repressors. we also find that midline and h15 expression are both subject to cross-repression and feedback inhibition. finally, a lineage analysis indicates that ventral midline-expressing cells and dorsal omb-expressing cells do not mix during development. together this data indicates that the ventral-specific expression of midline results from both transcriptional regulation and from a lack of cell-mixing between dorsal and ventral cells.

most animals express multiple isoforms of structural muscle proteins to produce tissues with different physiological properties. in drosophila, the adult muscles include tubular-type muscles and the fibrillar indirect flight muscles. regulatory processes specifying tubular muscle fate remain incompletely understood, therefore we chose to analyze the transcriptional regulation of tpnc41c, a troponin c gene expressed in the tubular jump muscles, but not in the fibrillar flight muscles. we identified a 300-bp promoter fragment of tpnc41c sufficient for the fiber-specific reporter expression. through an analysis of this regulatory element, we identified two sites necessary for the activation of the enhancer. mutations in each of these sites resulted in 70% reduction of enhancer activity. one site was characterized as a binding site for myocyte enhancer factor-2. in addition, we identified a repressive element that prevents activation of the enhancer in other muscle fiber types. mutation of this site increased jump muscle-specific expression of the reporter, but more importantly reporter expression expanded into the indirect flight muscles. our findings demonstrate that expression of the tpnc41c gene in jump muscles requires integration of multiple positive and negative transcriptional inputs. identification of the transcriptional regulators binding the cis-elements that we identified will reveal the regulatory pathways controlling muscle fiber differentiation.

steroid hormones are crucial for many biological events in multicellular organisms. in insects, the principal steroid hormones are ecdysteroids, which play essential roles in regulating molting and metamorphosis. during larval and pupal development, ecdysteroids are synthesized in the prothoracic gland (pg) from dietary cholesterol via a series of hydroxylation and oxidation steps. the expression of all but one of the known ecdysteroid biosynthetic enzymes is restricted to the pg, but the transcriptional regulatory networks responsible for generating such exquisite tissue-specific regulation is only beginning to be elucidated. here, we report identification and characterization of the c2h2-type zinc finger transcription factor ouija board (ouib) necessary for ecdysteroid production in the pg in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster. expression of ouib is predominantly limited to the pg, and genetic null mutants of ouib result in larval developmental arrest that can be rescued by administrating an active ecdysteroid. interestingly, ouib mutant animals exhibit a strong reduction in the expression of one ecdysteroid biosynthetic enzyme, spookier. using a cell culture-based luciferase reporter assay, ouib protein stimulates transcription of spok by binding to a specific ~15 bp response element in the spok pg enhancer element. most remarkable, the developmental arrest phenotype of ouib mutants is rescued by over-expression of a functionally-equivalent paralog of spookier. these observations imply that the main biological function of ouib is to specifically regulate spookier transcription during drosophila development.

the formation of motile spermatozoa involves the highly conserved formation of protamine-rich, tightly packed chromatin. however, genetic loss of protamine function in drosophila and mice does not lead to significant decompaction of sperm chromatin. this indicates that other proteins act redundantly or together with protamines. here, we identify prtl99c as a drosophila sperm chromatin-associated protein that is essential for male fertility. whereas the loss of protamines results in modest elongation of sperm nuclei, knockdown of prtl99c has a much stronger effect on sperm nuclei. loss of protamines and prtl99c indicates an additive effect of these proteins on chromatin compaction, in agreement with independent loading of these factors into sperm chromatin. these data reveal that at least three chromatin-binding proteins act together in chromatin reorganization to compact the paternal chromatin.

"embryogenesis is remarkably robust to segregating mutations and environmental variation; under a range of conditions, embryos of a given species develop into stereotypically patterned organisms. such robustness is thought to be conferred, in part, through elements within regulatory networks that perform similar, redundant tasks. redundant enhancers (or ""shadow"" enhancers), for example, can confer precision and robustness to gene expression, at least at individual, well-studied loci. however, the extent to which enhancer redundancy exists and can thereby have a major impact on developmental robustness remains unknown. here, we systematically assessed this, identifying over 1,000 predicted shadow enhancers during drosophila mesoderm development. the activity of 23 elements, associated with five genes, was examined in transgenic embryos, while natural structural variation among individuals was used to assess their ability to buffer against genetic variation. our results reveal three clear properties of enhancer redundancy within developmental systems. first, it is much more pervasive than previously anticipated, with 64% of loci examined having shadow enhancers. their spatial redundancy is often partial in nature, while the non-overlapping function may explain why these enhancers are maintained within a population. second, over 70% of loci do not follow the simple situation of having only two shadow enhancers-often there are three (rols), four (cadn and ade5), or five (traf1), at least one of which can be deleted with no obvious phenotypic effects. third, although shadow enhancers can buffer variation, patterns of segregating variation suggest that they play a more complex role in development than generally considered."

the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway directs a multitude of cellular responses during embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. stimulation of the pathway results in activation of hh target genes by the transcription factor ci/gli, which binds to specific motifs in genomic enhancers. in drosophila, only a few enhancers (patched, decapentaplegic, wingless, stripe, knot, hairy, orthodenticle) have been shown by in vivo functional assays to depend on direct ci/gli regulation. all but one (orthodenticle) contain more than one ci/gli site, prompting us to directly test whether homotypic clustering of ci/gli binding sites is sufficient to define a hh-regulated enhancer. we therefore developed a computational algorithm to identify ci/gli clusters that are enriched over random expectation, within a given region of the genome. candidate genomic regions containing ci/gli clusters were functionally tested in chicken neural tube electroporation assays and in transgenic flies. of the 22 ci/gli clusters tested, seven novel enhancers (and the previously known patched enhancer) were identified as hh-responsive and ci/gli-dependent in one or both of these assays, including: cuticular protein 100a (cpr100a); invected (inv), which encodes an engrailed-related transcription factor expressed at the anterior/posterior wing disc boundary; roadkill (rdx), the fly homolog of vertebrate spop; the segment polarity gene gooseberry (gsb); and two previously untested regions of the hh receptor-encoding patched (ptc) gene. we conclude that homotypic ci/gli clustering is not sufficient information to ensure hh-responsiveness; however, it can provide a clue for enhancer recognition within putative hedgehog target gene loci.

here we present a genome-wide method for de novo identification of enhancer regions. this approach enables massively parallel empirical investigation of dna sequences that mediate transcriptional activation and provides a platform for discovery of regulatory modules capable of driving context-specific gene expression. the method links fragmented genomic dna to the transcription of randomer molecule identifiers and measures the functional enhancer activity of the library by massively parallel sequencing. we transfected a drosophila melanogaster library into s2 cells in normoxia and hypoxia, and assayed 4,599,881 genomic dna fragments in parallel. the locations of the enhancer regions strongly correlate with genes up-regulated after hypoxia and previously described enhancers. novel enhancer regions were identified and integrated with rnaseq data and transcription factor motifs to describe the hypoxic response on a genome-wide basis as a complex regulatory network involving multiple stress-response pathways. this work provides a novel method for high-throughput assay of enhancer activity and the genome-scale identification of 31 hypoxia-activated enhancers in drosophila.

many organisms lose the capacity to regenerate damaged tissues as they mature. damaged drosophila imaginal discs regenerate efficiently early in the third larval instar (l3) but progressively lose this ability. this correlates with reduced damage-responsive expression of multiple genes, including the wnt genes wingless (wg) and wnt6. we demonstrate that damage-responsive expression of both genes requires a bipartite enhancer whose activity declines during l3. within this enhancer, a damage-responsive module stays active throughout l3, while an adjacent silencing element nucleates increasing levels of epigenetic silencing restricted to this enhancer. cas9-mediated deletion of the silencing element alleviates wnt repression, but is, in itself, insufficient to promote regeneration. however, directing myc expression to the blastema overcomes repression of multiple genes, including wg, and restores cellular responses necessary for regeneration. localized epigenetic silencing of damage-responsive enhancers can therefore restrict regenerative capacity in maturing organisms without compromising gene functions regulated by developmental signals.

genes are regulated by transcription factors that bind to regions of genomic dna called enhancers. considerable effort is focused on identifying transcription factor binding sites, with the goal of predicting gene expression from dna sequence. despite this effort, general, predictive models of enhancer function are currently lacking. here we combine quantitative models of enhancer function with manipulations using engineered transcription factors to examine the extent to which enhancer function can be controlled in a quantitatively predictable manner. our models, which incorporate few free parameters, can accurately predict the contributions of ectopic transcription factor inputs. these models allow the predictable 'tuning' of enhancers, providing a framework for the quantitative control of enhancers with engineered transcription factors.

glycolytic shift is a characteristic feature of rapidly proliferating cells, such as cells during development and during immune response or cancer cells, as well as of stem cells. it results in increased glycolysis uncoupled from mitochondrial respiration, also known as the warburg effect. notch signalling is active in contexts where cells undergo glycolytic shift. we decided to test whether metabolic genes are direct transcriptional targets of notch signalling and whether upregulation of metabolic genes can help notch to induce tissue growth under physiological conditions and in conditions of notch-induced hyperplasia. we show that genes mediating cellular metabolic changes towards the warburg effect are direct transcriptional targets of notch signalling. they include genes encoding proteins involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate to pyruvate conversion and repression of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. the direct transcriptional upregulation of metabolic genes is pi3k/akt independent and occurs not only in cells with overactivated notch but also in cells with endogenous levels of notch signalling and in vivo. even a short pulse of notch activity is able to elicit long-lasting metabolic changes resembling the warburg effect. loss of notch signalling in drosophila wing discs as well as in human microvascular cells leads to downregulation of glycolytic genes. notch-driven tissue overgrowth can be rescued by downregulation of genes for glucose metabolism. notch activity is able to support growth of wing during nutrient-deprivation conditions, independent of the growth of the rest of the body. notch is active in situations that involve metabolic reprogramming, and the direct regulation of metabolic genes may be a common mechanism that helps notch to exert its effects in target tissues.

motoneurons developmentally acquire appropriate cellular architectures that ensure connections with postsynaptic muscles and presynaptic neurons. in drosophila, leg motoneurons are organized as a myotopic map, where their dendritic domains represent the muscle field. here, we investigate mechanisms underlying development of aspects of this myotopic map, required for walking. a behavioral screen identified roles for semaphorins (sema) and plexins (plex) in walking behavior. deciphering this phenotype, we show that plexa/sema1a mediates motoneuron axon branching in ways that differ in the proximal femur and distal tibia, based on motoneuronal birth order. importantly, we show a novel role for glia in positioning dendrites of specific motoneurons; plexb/sema2a is required for dendritic positioning of late-born motoneurons but not early-born motoneurons. these findings indicate that communication within motoneurons and between glia and motoneurons, mediated by the combined action of different plexin/semaphorin signaling systems, are required for the formation of a functional myotopic map.

eye development requires an evolutionarily conserved group of transcription factors, termed the retinal determination network (rdn). however, little is known about the molecular mechanism by which the rdn instructs cells to differentiate into photoreceptors. we show that photoreceptor cell identity in drosophila is critically regulated by the transcription factor glass, which is primarily expressed in photoreceptors and whose role in this process was previously unknown. glass is both required and sufficient for the expression of phototransduction proteins. our results demonstrate that the rdn member sine oculis directly activates glass expression, and that glass activates the expression of the transcription factors hazy and otd. we identified hazy as a direct target of glass. induced expression of hazy in the retina partially rescues the glass mutant phenotype. together, our results provide a transcriptional link between eye field specification and photoreceptor differentiation in drosophila, placing glass at a central position in this developmental process.

the transcription factor suppressor of hairless and its coactivator, the notch intracellular domain, are polyglutamine (pq)-rich factors that target enhancer elements and interact with other locally bound pq-rich factors. to understand the functional repertoire of such enhancers, we identify conserved regulatory belts with binding sites for the pq-rich effectors of both notch and bmp/dpp signaling, and the pq-deficient tissue selectors apterous (ap), scalloped (sd), and vestigial (vg). we find that the densest such binding site cluster in the genome is located in the bmp-inducible nab locus, a homolog of the vertebrate transcriptional cofactors nab1/nab2 we report three major findings. first, we find that this nab regulatory belt is a novel enhancer driving dorsal wing margin expression in regions of peak phosphorylated mad in wing imaginal discs. second, we show that ap is developmentally required to license the nab dorsal wing margin enhancer (dwme) to read out notch and dpp signaling in the dorsal compartment. third, we find that the nab dwme is embedded in a complex of intronic enhancers, including a wing quadrant enhancer, a proximal wing disc enhancer, and a larval brain enhancer. this enhancer complex coordinates global nab expression via both tissue-specific activation and interenhancer silencing. we suggest that dwme integration of bmp signaling maintains nab expression in proliferating margin descendants that have divided away from notch-delta boundary signaling. as such, uniform expression of genes like nab and vestigial in proliferating compartments would typically require both boundary and nonboundary lineage-specific enhancers.

cis-regulatory modules (crms) generate precise expression patterns by integrating numerous transcription factors (tfs). surprisingly, crms that control essential gene patterns can differ greatly in conservation, suggesting distinct constraints on tf binding sites. here, we show that a highly conserved distal-less regulatory element (dcre) that controls gene expression in leg precursor cells recruits multiple hox, extradenticle (exd) and homothorax (hth) complexes to mediate dual outputs: thoracic activation and abdominal repression. using reporter assays, we found that abdominal repression is particularly robust, as neither individual binding site mutations nor a dna binding deficient hth protein abolished cooperative dna binding and in vivo repression. moreover, a re-engineered dcre containing a distinct configuration of hox, exd, and hth sites also mediated abdominal hox repression. however, the re-engineered dcre failed to perform additional segment-specific functions such as thoracic activation. these findings are consistent with two emerging concepts in gene regulation: first, the abdominal hox/exd/hth factors utilize protein-protein and protein-dna interactions to form repression complexes on flexible combinations of sites, consistent with the tf collective model of crm organization. second, the conserved dcre mediates multiple cell-type specific outputs, consistent with recent findings that pleiotropic crms are associated with conserved tf binding and added evolutionary constraints.

animals rely on highly sensitive thermoreceptors to seek out optimal temperatures, but the molecular mechanisms of thermosensing are not well understood. the dorsal organ cool cells (doccs) of the drosophila larva are a set of exceptionally thermosensitive neurons critical for larval cool avoidance. here, we show that docc cool-sensing is mediated by ionotropic receptors (irs), a family of sensory receptors widely studied in invertebrate chemical sensing. we find that two irs, ir21a and ir25a, are required to mediate docc responses to cooling and are required for cool avoidance behavior. furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of ir21a can confer cool-responsiveness in an ir25a-dependent manner, suggesting an instructive role for ir21a in thermosensing. together, these data show that ir family receptors can function together to mediate thermosensation of exquisite sensitivity.

the hedgehog signaling pathway is part of the ancient developmental-evolutionary animal toolkit. frequently co-opted to pattern new structures, the pathway is conserved among eumetazoans yet flexible and pleiotropic in its effects. the hedgehog receptor, patched, is transcriptionally activated by hedgehog, providing essential negative feedback in all tissues. our locus-wide dissections of the cis-regulatory landscapes of fly patched and mouse ptch1 reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. the seemingly simple, constitutive hedgehog response of patched/ptch1 is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. this structure-one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes-explains how patched/ptch1 can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function. it may also suggest a general model for the evolutionary flexibility of conserved regulators and pathways.

transcription is episodic, consisting of a series of discontinuous bursts. using live-imaging methods and quantitative analysis, we examine transcriptional bursting in living drosophila embryos. different developmental enhancers positioned downstream of synthetic reporter genes produce transcriptional bursts with similar amplitudes and duration but generate very different bursting frequencies, with strong enhancers producing more bursts than weak enhancers. insertion of an insulator reduces the number of bursts and the corresponding level of gene expression, suggesting that enhancer regulation of bursting frequency is a key parameter of gene control in development. we also show that linked reporter genes exhibit coordinated bursting profiles when regulated by a shared enhancer, challenging conventional models of enhancer-promoter looping.

the bmp signaling pathway has a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. in drosophila, graded bmp signaling is transduced by the mad transcription factor and opposed by the brinker repressor. in this study, using the drosophila embryo as a model, we combine rna-seq with mad and brinker chip-seq to decipher the bmp-responsive transcriptional network underpinning differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. we identify multiple new bmp target genes, including positive and negative regulators of egf signaling. manipulation of egf signaling levels by loss- and gain-of-function studies reveals that egf signaling negatively regulates embryonic bmp-responsive transcription. therefore, the bmp gene network has a self-regulating property in that it establishes a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic egf signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. in terms of bmp-dependent transcription, we identify key roles for the zelda and zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and find widespread binding of insulator proteins to the mad and brinker-bound genomic regions. analysis of embryos lacking the beaf-32 insulator protein shows reduced transcription of a peak bmp target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak bmp signaling. we incorporate our findings into a model for mad-dependent activation, and discuss its relevance to bmp signal interpretation in vertebrates.

in the early drosophila melanogaster embryo, the gene regulatory network controlled by dpp signaling is involved in the subdivision of dorsal ectoderm into the presumptive dorsal epidermis and amnioserosa. in this work, we aimed to identify new dpp downstream targets involved in dorsal ectoderm patterning. we used oligonucleotide d. melanogaster microarrays to identify the set of genes that are differential expressed between wild type embryos and embryos that overexpress dpp (nos-gal4>uas-dpp) during early stages of embryo development. by using this approach, we identified 358 genes whose relative abundance significantly increased in response to dpp overexpression. among them, we found the entire set of known dpp target genes that function in dorsal ectoderm patterning (zen, doc, hnt, pnr, ush, tup, and others) in addition to several up-regulated genes of unknown functions. spatial expression pattern of up-regulated genes in response to dpp overexpression as well as their opposing transcriptional responses to dpp loss- and gain-of-function indicated that they are new candidate target genes of dpp signaling pathway. we further analyse one of the candidate genes, cg13653, which is expressed at the dorsal-most cells of the embryo during a restricted period of time. cg13653 orthologs were not detected in basal lineages of dipterans, which unlike d. melanogaster develop two extra-embryonic membranes, amnion and serosa. we characterized the enhancer region of cg13653 and revealed that cg13653 is directly regulated by dpp signaling pathway.

the pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve) plays a key role in the regulatory hierarchy governing segmentation in drosophila. here we describe the use of p-transformation and eve promoter fusions to identify cis elements that regulate the periodic seven-stripe eve pattern. a distal region of the eve promoter, located between -5.9 and -5.2 kb, controls autoregulation. sequences from this region will induce striped expression of a heterologous hsp70 basal promoter in the presence, but not absence, of endogenous eve+ products. autoregulatory activity was localized to a 200-bp region of the distal eve promoter. we also provide evidence that individual eve expression stripes are regulated by separate cis sequences. eve promoter sequences located between -4.7 and -3 kb upstream of the transcription start site are important for the initiation of stripe 3, whereas sequences between -1.7 and -0.4 kb are needed for stripes 2 and 7. it is possible that these latter regions are directly regulated by the products of gap genes.

drosophila has three types of visual organs, the larval eyes or bolwig's organs (bo), the ocelli (oc) and the compound eyes (ce). in all, the bhlh protein atonal (ato) functions as the proneural factor for photoreceptors and effects the transition from progenitor cells to differentiating neurons. in this work, we investigate the regulation of ato expression in the bo primordium (bop). surprisingly, we find that ato transcription in the bop is entirely independent of the shared regulatory dna for the developing ce and oc. the core enhancer for bop expression, atobo, lies ~6kb upstream of the ato gene, in contrast to the downstream location of ce and oc regulatory elements. moreover, maintenance of ato expression in the neuronal precursors through autoregulation-a common and ancient feature of ato expression that is well-documented in eyes, ocelli and chordotonal organs-does not occur in the bo. we also show that the atobo enhancer contains two binding sites for the transcription factor sine oculis (so), a core component of the progenitor specification network in all three visual organs. these binding sites function in vivo and are specifically bound by so in vitro. taken together, our findings reveal that the control of ato transcription in the evolutionarily derived bo has diverged considerably from ato regulation in the more ancestral compound eyes and ocelli, to the extent of acquiring what appears to be a distinct and evolutionarily novel cis-regulatory module.

the orphan nuclear receptor ftz-f1 is expressed in all somatic nuclei in drosophila embryos, but mutations result in a pair-rule phenotype. this was explained by the interaction of ftz-f1 with the homeodomain protein ftz that is expressed in stripes in the primordia of segments missing in either ftz-f1 or ftz mutants. ftz-f1 and ftz were shown to physically interact and coordinately activate the expression of ftz itself and engrailed by synergistic binding to composite ftz-f1/ftz binding sites. however, attempts to identify additional target genes on the basis of ftz-f1/ ftz binding alone has met with only limited success. to discern rules for ftz-f1 target site selection in vivo and to identify additional target genes, a microarray analysis was performed comparing wildtype and ftz-f1 mutant embryos. ftz-f1-responsive genes most highly regulated included engrailed and nine additional genes expressed in patterns dependent on both ftz and ftz-f1. candidate enhancers for these genes were identified by combining bdtnp ftz chip-chip data with a computational search for ftz-f1 binding sites. of eight enhancer reporter genes tested in transgenic embryos, six generated expression patterns similar to the corresponding endogenous gene and expression was lost in ftz mutants. these studies identified a new set of ftz-f1 targets, all of which are co-regulated by ftz. comparative analysis of enhancers containing ftz/ftz-f1 binding sites that were or were not bona fide targets in vivo suggested that gaf negatively regulates enhancers that contain ftz/ftz-f1 binding sites but are not actually utilized. these targets include other regulatory factors as well as genes involved directly in morphogenesis, providing insight into how pair-rule genes establish the body pattern.

in most animals, the bulk of sperm dna is packaged with sperm nuclear basic proteins (snbps), a diverse group of highly basic chromosomal proteins notably comprising mammalian protamines. the replacement of histones with snbps during spermiogenesis allows sperm dna to reach an extreme level of compaction, but little is known about how snbps actually function in vivo mst77f is a drosophila snbp with unique dna condensation properties in vitro, but its role during spermiogenesis remains unclear. here, we show that mst77f is required for the compaction of sperm dna and the production of mature sperm, through its cooperation with protamine-like proteins mst35ba/b. we demonstrate that mst77f is incorporated in spermatid chromatin as a precursor protein, which is subsequently processed through the proteolysis of its n-terminus. the cleavage of mst77f is very similar to the processing of protamine p2 during human spermiogenesis and notably leaves the cysteine residues in the mature protein intact, suggesting that they participate in the formation of disulfide cross-links. despite the rapid evolution of snbps, sperm chromatin condensation thus involves remarkably convergent mechanisms in distantly related animals.

biological systems display extraordinary robustness. robustness of transcriptional enhancers results mainly from clusters of binding sites for the same transcription factor, and it is not clear how robust enhancers can evolve loss of expression through point mutations. here, we report the high-resolution functional dissection of a robust enhancer of the shavenbaby gene that has contributed to morphological evolution. we found that robustness is encoded by many binding sites for the transcriptional activator arrowhead and that, during evolution, some of these activator sites were lost, weakening enhancer activity. complete silencing of enhancer function, however, required evolution of a binding site for the spatially restricted potent repressor abrupt. these findings illustrate that recruitment of repressor binding sites can overcome enhancer robustness and may minimize pleiotropic consequences of enhancer evolution. recruitment of repression may be a general mode of evolution to break robust regulatory linkages.

developmental patterning and tissue formation are regulated through complex gene regulatory networks (grns) driven through the action of transcription factors (tfs) converging on enhancer elements. here, as a point of entry to dissect the poorly defined grn underlying cardiomyocyte differentiation, we apply an integrated approach to identify active enhancers and tfs involved in drosophila heart development. the drosophila heart consists of 104 cardiomyocytes, representing less than 0.5% of all cells in the embryo. by modifying bits-chip for rare cells, we examined h3k4me3 and h3k27ac chromatin landscapes to identify active promoters and enhancers specifically in cardiomyocytes. these in vivo data were complemented by a machine learning approach and extensive in vivo validation in transgenic embryos, which identified many new heart enhancers and their associated tf motifs. our results implicate many new tfs in late stages of heart development, including bagpipe, an nkx3.2 ortholog, which we show is essential for differentiated heart function.

the sevenless gene controls the fate of a single photoreceptor cell type in the developing eye of drosophila. its rna and protein accumulate transiently in a subpopulation of cells in the developing eye imaginal disc. we have used p-element transformation with different minigenes and marker gene constructs to identify cis-acting regulatory regions required for the complex sevenless expression pattern. our results indicate that the upstream region of the sevenless gene is devoid of any detectable regulatory elements and that sequences located 3' to the transcription start site are sufficient to promote the sevenless expression pattern. these gene-internal sequences function in both orientations on heterologous promoters, also when placed at the 3' end of a lacz reporter gene.

amino acids are important nutrients for animals, reflected in conserved internal pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates for monitoring cellular levels of these compounds. in mammals, sensory cells and metabotropic glutamate receptor-related taste receptors that detect environmental sources of amino acids in food are also well-characterised. by contrast, it is unclear how insects perceive this class of molecules through peripheral chemosensory mechanisms. here we investigate amino acid sensing in drosophila melanogaster larvae, which feed ravenously to support their rapid growth. we show that larvae display diverse behaviours (attraction, aversion, neutral) towards different amino acids, which depend upon stimulus concentration. some of these behaviours require ir76b, a member of the variant ionotropic glutamate receptor repertoire of invertebrate chemoreceptors. ir76b is broadly expressed in larval taste neurons, suggesting a role as a co-receptor. we identify a subpopulation of these neurons that displays physiological activation by some, but not all, amino acids, and which mediate suppression of feeding by high concentrations of at least a subset of these compounds. our data reveal the first elements of a sophisticated neuronal and molecular substrate by which these animals detect and behave towards external sources of amino acids.

we investigated the functional overlap of two muscle troponin c (tpnc) genes that are expressed in the adult fruit fly, drosophila melanogaster: tpnc4 is predominantly expressed in the indirect flight muscles (ifms), whereas tpnc41c is the main isoform in the tergal depressor of the trochanter muscle (tdt; jump muscle). using crispr/cas9, we created a transgenic line with a homozygous deletion of tpnc41c and compared its phenotype to a line lacking functional tpnc4 we found that the removal of either of these genes leads to expression of the other isoform in both muscle types. the switching between isoforms occurs at the transcriptional level and involves minimal enhancers located upstream of the transcription start points of each gene. functionally, the two tpnc isoforms were not equal. although ectopic tpnc4 in tdt muscles was able to maintain jumping ability, tpnc41c in ifms could not effectively support flying. simultaneous functional disruption of both tpnc genes resulted in jump-defective and flightless phenotypes of the survivors, as well as abnormal sarcomere organization. these results indicated that tpnc is required for myofibril assembly, and that there is functional specialization among tpnc isoforms in drosophila.

gastrulation of the drosophila embryo is one of the most intensively studied morphogenetic processes in animal development [1-4]. particular efforts have focused on the formation of the ventral furrow, whereby ∼1,000 presumptive mesoderm cells exhibit coordinated apical constrictions that mediate invagination [5, 6]. apical constriction depends on a rho gtpase signaling pathway (t48/fog) that is deployed by the developmental regulatory genes twist and snail [7-10]. it is thought that coordinate mesoderm constriction depends on high levels of myosin along the ventral midline, although the basis for this localization is uncertain. here, we employ newly developed quantitative imaging methods to visualize the transcriptional dynamics of two key components of the rho signaling pathway in living embryos, t48 and fog. both genes display dorsoventral (dv) gradients of expression due to differential timing of transcription activation. transcription begins as a narrow stripe of two or three cells along the ventral midline, followed by progressive expansions into more lateral regions. quantitative image analyses suggest that these temporal gradients produce differential spatial accumulations of t48 and fog mrnas along the dv axis, similar to the distribution of myosin activity. we therefore propose that the transcriptional dynamics of t48 and fog expression foreshadow the coordinated invagination of the mesoderm at the onset of gastrulation.

animals adapt their behaviors to specific ecological niches, but the genetic and cellular basis of nervous system evolution is poorly understood. we have compared the olfactory circuits of the specialist drosophila sechellia-which feeds exclusively on morinda citrifolia fruit-with its generalist cousins d. melanogaster and d. simulans. we show that d. sechellia exhibits derived odor-evoked attraction and physiological sensitivity to the abundant morinda volatile hexanoic acid and characterize how the responsible sensory receptor (the variant ionotropic glutamate receptor ir75b) and attraction-mediating circuit have evolved. a single amino acid change in ir75b is sufficient to recode it as a hexanoic acid detector. expanded representation of this sensory pathway in the brain relies on additional changes in the ir75b promoter and trans-acting loci. by contrast, higher-order circuit adaptations are not apparent, suggesting conserved central processing. our work links olfactory ecology to structural and regulatory genetic changes influencing nervous system anatomy and function.

how differential levels of gene expression are controlled in post-mitotic neurons is poorly understood. in the drosophila retina, expression of the transcription factor defective proventriculus (dve) at distinct cell type-specific levels is required for terminal differentiation of color- and motion-detecting photoreceptors. here, we find that the activities of two cis-regulatory enhancers are coordinated to drive dve expression in the fly eye. three transcription factors act on these enhancers to determine cell-type specificity. negative autoregulation by dve maintains expression from each enhancer at distinct homeostatic levels. one enhancer acts as an inducible backup ('dark' shadow enhancer) that is normally repressed but becomes active in the absence of the other enhancer. thus, two enhancers integrate combinatorial transcription factor input, feedback and redundancy to generate cell type-specific levels of dve expression and stable photoreceptor fate. this regulatory logic may represent a general paradigm for how precise levels of gene expression are established and maintained in post-mitotic neurons.

a cis-acting sequence from the drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase (ddc) gene is selectively required for ddc expression in the central nervous system. we analyze several parameters influencing the function of the sequence element and describe a factor which interacts with it and mediates cns expression of ddc. the element, element i, can function in vivo when included on a synthetic oligonucleotide inserted near its normal location, or closer to the rna startpoint. it displays partial activity when inverted. two different 2-bp mutations in element i abolish its ability to stimulate neuronal ddc expression in the cns. a factor present in embryonic nuclear extracts specifically protects element i in dnase i footprinting assays. the binding affinity of this factor is reduced by each alteration of element i that inhibits neuronal expression, indicating a role in mediating cns expression of ddc. element i alone has no detectable activity when placed adjacent to a heterologous promoter, although 2.2 kb of 5' ddc sequences direct correct cell-specific expression of a heterologous promoter.

in drosophila spermatogenesis transcription occurs only premeiotically while translation can be detected also in postmeiotic spermatids. to analyse the underlying processes mst(3)gl-9, a gene specifically expressed in the male germ cells of drosophila melanogaster, was studied. the putative protein encoded by mst(3)gl-9 is mostly composed of repetitive cys-gly-pro motifs. the transcriptional and translational control of expression of mst(3)gl-9 has been investigated by p-mediated transformation. only 102 bp of 5' upstream sequences and the first 201 bp of the gene are sufficient to maintain the gene specific characteristics of expression, namely premeiotic transcription and postmeiotic translation separated by 3 days of development.

the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk) receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) plays a critical role in the specification of founder cells (fcs) in the drosophila visceral mesoderm (vm) during embryogenesis. reporter gene and crispr/cas9 deletion analysis reveals enhancer regions in and upstream of the alk locus that influence tissue-specific expression in the amnioserosa (as), the vm and the epidermis. by performing high throughput yeast one-hybrid screens (y1h) with a library of drosophila transcription factors (tfs) we identify odd-paired (opa), the drosophila homologue of the vertebrate zic family of tfs, as a novel regulator of embryonic alk expression. further characterization identifies evolutionarily conserved opa-binding cis-regulatory motifs in one of the alk associated enhancer elements. employing alk reporter lines as well as crispr/cas9-mediated removal of regulatory elements in the alk locus, we show modulation of alk expression by opa in the embryonic as, epidermis and vm. in addition, we identify enhancer elements that integrate input from additional tfs, such as binou (bin) and bagpipe (bap), to regulate vm expression of alk in a combinatorial manner. taken together, our data show that the opa zinc finger tf is a novel regulator of embryonic alk expression.

drosophila leg morphogenesis occurs under the control of a relatively well-known genetic cascade, which mobilizes both cell signaling pathways and tissue-specific transcription factors. however, their cross-regulatory interactions, deployed to refine leg patterning, remain poorly characterized at the gene expression level. within the genetically interacting landscape that governs limb development, the bric-à-brac2 (bab2) gene is required for distal leg segmentation. we have previously shown that the distal-less (dll) homeodomain and rotund (rn) zinc-finger activating transcription factors control limb-specific bab2 expression by binding directly a single critical leg/antennal enhancer (lae) within the bric-à-brac locus. by genetic and molecular analyses, we show here that the egfr-responsive c15 homeodomain and the notch-regulated bowl zinc-finger transcription factors also interact directly with the lae enhancer as a repressive duo. the appendage patterning gene bab2 is the first identified direct target of the bowl repressor, an odd-skipped/osr family member. moreover, we show that c15 acts on lae activity independently of its regular partner, the aristaless homeoprotein. instead, we find that c15 interacts physically with the dll activator through contacts between their homeodomain and binds competitively with dll to adjacent cognate sites on lae, adding potential new layers of regulation by c15. lastly, we show that c15 and bowl activities regulate also rn expression. our findings shed light on how the concerted action of two transcriptional repressors, in response to cell signaling inputs, shapes and refines gene expression along the limb proximo-distal axis in a timely manner.

the drosophila gap gene hunchback (hb) is required for the establishment of the anterior segment pattern of the embryo, and also for a small region of the posterior segment pattern. the hb gene encodes two transcripts from two promoters which show a differential regulation, although they code for the same protein product. the 3.2-kb transcript is expressed during oogenesis and forms an anterior-posterior gradient during the early stages of development. the first zygotic expression of hb during cleavage stages 11-12 is due to the 2.9-kb transcript. its expression is under the control of the anterior pattern organizer gene bicoid (bcd) and it appears to be necessary and sufficient for the anterior segmentation. the 3.2-kb transcript is expressed again at syncytial blastoderm stage in the anterior yolk nuclei, as well as in an anterior stripe which is posteriorly adjacent to the domain of the 2.9-kb transcript, and as a posterior stripe. using hb-promoter/lacz fusion gene constructs in combination with germ line transformation, we have delimited a regulatory region for the 2.9-kb transcript to approximately 300 bp upstream of the site of transcription initiation and show that this region is sufficient to confer the full regulation by bcd.

insects use hygrosensation (humidity sensing) to avoid desiccation and, in vectors such as mosquitoes, to locate vertebrate hosts. sensory neurons activated by either dry or moist air ('dry cells' and 'moist cells') have been described in many insects, but their behavioral roles and the molecular basis of their hygrosensitivity remain unclear. we recently reported that drosophila hygrosensation relies on three ionotropic receptors (irs) required for dry cell function: ir25a, ir93a and ir40a (knecht et al., 2016). here, we discover drosophila moist cells and show that they require ir25a and ir93a together with ir68a, a conserved, but orphan ir. both ir68a- and ir40a-dependent pathways drive hygrosensory behavior: each is important for dry-seeking by hydrated flies and together they underlie moist-seeking by dehydrated flies. these studies reveal that humidity sensing in drosophila, and likely other insects, involves the combined activity of two molecularly related but neuronally distinct hygrosensing systems.

hox transcription factors specify distinct cell types along the anterior-posterior axis of metazoans by regulating target genes that modulate signaling pathways. a well-established example is the induction of epidermal growth factor (egf) signaling by an abdominal-a (abd-a) hox complex during the specification of drosophila hepatocyte-like cells (oenocytes). previous studies revealed that abd-a is non-cell autonomously required to promote oenocyte fate by directly activating a gene (rhomboid) that triggers egf secretion from sensory organ precursor (sop) cells. neighboring cells that receive the egf signal initiate a largely unknown pathway to promote oenocyte fate. here, we show that abd-a also plays a cell autonomous role in inducing oenocyte fate by activating the expression of the pointed-p1 (pntp1) ets transcription factor downstream of egf signaling. genetic studies demonstrate that both pntp1 and pntp2 are required for oenocyte specification. moreover, we found that pntp1 contains a conserved enhancer (pntp1oe) that is activated in oenocyte precursor cells by egf signaling via direct regulation by the pnt transcription factors as well as a transcription factor complex consisting of abd-a, extradenticle, and homothorax. our findings demonstrate that the same abd-a hox complex required for sending the egf signal from sop cells, enhances the competency of receiving cells to select oenocyte cell fate by up-regulating pntp1. since pntp1 is a downstream effector of egf signaling, these findings provide insight into how a hox factor can both trigger and potentiate the egf signal to promote an essential cell fate along the body plan.

metazoan gene expression is controlled through the action of long stretches of noncoding dna that contain enhancers-shorter sequences responsible for controlling a single aspect of a gene's expression pattern. models built on thermodynamics have shown how enhancers interpret protein concentration in order to determine specific levels of gene expression, but the emergent regulatory logic of a complete regulatory locus shows qualitative and quantitative differences from isolated enhancers. such differences may arise from steric competition limiting the quantity of dna that can simultaneously influence the transcription machinery. we incorporated this competition into a mechanistic model of gene regulation, generated efficient algorithms for this computation, and applied it to the regulation of drosophila even-skipped (eve). this model finds the location of enhancers and identifies which factors control the boundaries of eve expression. this model predicts a new enhancer that, when assayed in vivo, drives expression in a non-eve pattern. incorporation of chromatin accessibility eliminates this inconsistency.

the role of spatially localized repressors in supporting embryonic patterning is well appreciated, but, alternatively, the role ubiquitously expressed repressors play in this process is not well understood. we investigated the function of two broadly expressed repressors, runt (run) and suppressor of hairless [su(h)], in patterning the drosophila embryo. previous studies have shown that run and su(h) regulate gene expression along anterior-posterior (ap) or dorsal-ventral (dv) axes, respectively, by spatially limiting activator action, but here we characterize a different role. our data show that broadly expressed repressors silence particular enhancers within cis-regulatory systems, blocking their expression throughout the embryo fully but transiently, and, in this manner, regulate spatiotemporal outputs along both axes. our results suggest that run and su(h) regulate the temporal action of enhancers and are not dedicated regulators of one axis but, instead, act coordinately to pattern both axes, ap and dv.

grainy head (grh) is a conserved transcription factor (tf) controlling epithelial differentiation and regeneration. to elucidate grh functions we identified embryonic grh targets by chip-seq and gene expression analysis. we show that grh controls hundreds of target genes. repression or activation correlates with the distance of grh-binding sites to the transcription start sites of its targets. analysis of 54 grh-responsive enhancers during development and upon wounding suggests cooperation with distinct tfs in different contexts. in the airways, grh-repressed genes encode key tfs involved in branching and cell differentiation. reduction of the pou domain tf ventral veins lacking (vvl) largely ameliorates the airway morphogenesis defects of grh mutants. vvl and grh proteins additionally interact with each other and regulate a set of common enhancers during epithelial morphogenesis. we conclude that grh and vvl participate in a regulatory network controlling epithelial maturation.

pattern formation relies on the generation of transcriptional landscapes regulated by signalling pathways. a paradigm of epithelial patterning is the distribution of vein territories in the drosophila wing disc. in this tissue, decapentaplegic signalling regulates its target genes at different distances from the source of the ligand. the transformation of signalling into coherent territories of gene expression requires regulatory cross-interactions between these target genes. here, we analyse the mechanisms generating the domain of knirps expression in the presumptive l2 vein of the wing imaginal disc. we find that knirps is regulated by four decapentaplegic target genes encoding the transcription factors aristaless, spalt major, spalt-related and optix the expression of optix is activated by dpp and repressed by the spalt proteins, becoming restricted to the most anterior region of the wing blade. in turn, the expression of knirps is activated by aristaless and repressed by optix and the spalt proteins. in this manner, the expression of knirps becomes restricted to those cells where spalt levels are sufficient to repress optix, but not sufficient to repress knirps.

circadian clocks organize the metabolism, physiology, and behavior of organisms throughout the day-night cycle by controlling daily rhythms in gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. while many transcription factors underlying circadian oscillations are known, the splicing factors that modulate these rhythms remain largely unexplored. a genome-wide assessment of the alterations of gene expression in a null mutant of the alternative splicing regulator sr-related matrix protein of 160 kda (srm160) revealed the extent to which alternative splicing impacts on behavior-related genes. we show that srm160 affects gene expression in pacemaker neurons of the drosophila brain to ensure proper oscillations of the molecular clock. a reduced level of srm160 in adult pacemaker neurons impairs circadian rhythms in locomotor behavior, and this phenotype is caused, at least in part, by a marked reduction in period (per) levels. moreover, rhythmic accumulation of the neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor in the dorsal projections of these neurons is abolished after srm160 depletion. the lack of rhythmicity in srm160-downregulated flies is reversed by a fully spliced per construct, but not by an extra copy of the endogenous locus, showing that srm160 positively regulates per levels in a splicing-dependent manner. our findings highlight the significant effect of alternative splicing on the nervous system and particularly on brain function in an in vivo model.

balancing self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells requires differential expression of self-renewing factors in two daughter cells generated from the asymmetric division of the stem cells. in drosophila type ii neural stem cell (or neuroblast, nb) lineages, the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix-orange (bhlh-o) family proteins, including deadpan (dpn) and e(spl) proteins, is required for maintaining the self-renewal and identity of type ii nbs, whereas the absence of these self-renewing factors is essential for the differentiation of intermediate neural progenitors (inps) generated from type ii nbs. here, we demonstrate that dpn maintains type ii nbs by suppressing the expression of earmuff (erm). we provide evidence that dpn and e(spl) proteins suppress erm by directly binding to c-sites and n-boxes in the cis-regulatory region of erm. conversely, the absence of bhlh-o proteins in inps allows activation of erm and erm-mediated maturation of inps. our results further suggest that pointed p1 (pntp1) mediates the dedifferentiation of inps resulting from the loss of erm or overexpression of dpn or e(spl) proteins. taken together, these findings reveal mechanisms underlying the regulation of the maintenance of type ii nbs and differentiation of inps through the differential expression of bhlh-o family proteins.

homeostasis of adult tissues is maintained by a small number of stem cells, which are sustained by their niches. in the drosophila female germline stem cell (gsc) niche, decapentaplegic (dpp) is the primary factor that promotes gsc self-renewal. however, the mechanism regulating dpp expression in the niche is largely unknown. here, we identify a 2.0 kb fragment located in a 5' cis-regulatory region of the dpp locus containing enhancer activity that drives its expression in the niche. this region is distinct from a previously characterized 3' cis-regulatory enhancer responsible for dpp expression in imaginal discs. our data demonstrate that engrailed, a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that serves as a cap cell marker, binds to this region and regulates dpp expression in cap cells. further data suggest that en forms a complex with nejire (nej), the drosophila ortholog of histone acetyltransferase cbp/p300, and directs nej to this cis-regulatory region where nej functions as the co-activator for dpp expression. therefore, our study defines the molecular pathway controlling dpp expression in the drosophila ovarian stem cell niche.

pairs of duplicated genes generally display a combination of conserved expression patterns inherited from their unduplicated ancestor and newly acquired domains. however, how the cis-regulatory architecture of duplicated loci evolves to produce these expression patterns is poorly understood. we have directly examined the gene-regulatory evolution of two tandem duplicates, the drosophila ly6 genes cg9336 and cg9338, which arose at the base of the drosophilids between 40 and 60 ma. comparing the expression patterns of the two paralogs in four drosophila species with that of the unduplicated ortholog in the tephritid ceratitis capitata, we show that they diverged from each other as well as from the unduplicated ortholog. moreover, the expression divergence appears to have occurred close to the duplication event and also more recently in a lineage-specific manner. the comparison of the tissue-specific cis-regulatory modules (crms) controlling the paralog expression in the four drosophila species indicates that diverse cis-regulatory mechanisms, including the novel tissue-specific enhancers, differential inactivation, and enhancer sharing, contributed to the expression evolution. our analysis also reveals a surprisingly variable cis-regulatory architecture, in which the crms driving conserved expression domains change in number, location, and specificity. altogether, this study provides a detailed historical account that uncovers a highly dynamic picture of how the paralog expression patterns and their underlying cis-regulatory landscape evolve. we argue that our findings will encourage studying cis-regulatory evolution at the whole-locus level to understand how interactions between enhancers and other regulatory levels shape the evolution of gene expression.

the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) is expressed in specific parts of drosophila embryos: in a single metamer in the visceral mesoderm and forming a complex pattern limited to a broad domain in the ectoderm and in the somatic mesoderm. here we use a linked beta-galactosidase gene to identify cis-acting regulatory sequences. in the visceral mesoderm, correct expression of ubx depends on localized upstream sequences. in the ectoderm, all galactosidase-positive transformants show the same characteristic pattern. the repeated elements of this basal pattern appear to be a sub-pattern of engrailed (en) expression; they depend on en function as well as on sequences in the ubx rna leader. we use a mutant (haltere-mimic) to show that sequences that normally restrict segmental expression of ubx in the ectoderm are located downstream from the rna leader.

hox mediated neuroblast apoptosis is a prevalent way to pattern larval central nervous system (cns) by different hox genes, but the mechanism of this apoptosis is not understood. our studies with abdominal-a (abd-a) mediated larval neuroblast (pnb) apoptosis suggests that abda, its cofactor extradenticle (exd), a helix-loop-helix transcription factor grainyhead (grh), and notch signaling transcriptionally contribute to expression of rhg family of apoptotic genes. we find that grh, abda, and exd function together at multiple motifs on the apoptotic enhancer. in vivo mutagenesis of these motifs suggest that they are important for the maintenance of the activity of the enhancer rather than its initiation. we also find that exd function is independent of its known partner homothorax in this apoptosis. we extend some of our findings to deformed expressing region of sub-esophageal ganglia where pnbs undergo a similar hox dependent apoptosis. we propose a mechanism where common players like exd-grh-notch work with different hox genes through region specific enhancers to pattern respective segments of larval central nervous system.

antennapedia (antp), a homeotic gene of drosophila required for proper differentiation of the thorax of the fly, is expressed in complex spatial patterns during development. the gene is greater than 100 kb long and has two independently regulated promoters. to characterize cis-acting regulatory elements responsible for the expression pattern, fusions of the antp promoter 2 cap site and upstream sequences to an adh-lacz gene were introduced into flies. a 10-kb sequence directs beta-galactosidase production in a pattern that closely resembles the endogenous p2 pattern. transcription from the 10-kb fusions is regulated by three genes that regulate antp transcription. control elements, including a target of action of homeo-domain-containing proteins, were mapped by deleting parts of the 10-kb sequence.

transcriptional enhancers regulate spatio-temporal gene expression. while genomic assays can identify putative enhancers en masse, assigning target genes is a complex challenge. we devised a machine learning approach, mcenhancer, which links target genes to putative enhancers via a semi-supervised learning algorithm that predicts gene expression patterns based on enriched sequence features. predicted expression patterns were 73-98% accurate, predicted assignments showed strong hi-c interaction enrichment, enhancer-associated histone modifications were evident, and known functional motifs were recovered. our model provides a general framework to link globally identified enhancers to targets and contributes to deciphering the regulatory genome.

transcription factors bind low-affinity dna sequences for only short durations. it is not clear how brief, low-affinity interactions can drive efficient transcription. here, we report that the transcription factor ultrabithorax (ubx) utilizes low-affinity binding sites in the drosophila melanogaster shavenbaby (svb) locus and related enhancers in nuclear microenvironments of high ubx concentrations. related enhancers colocalize to the same microenvironments independently of their chromosomal location, suggesting that microenvironments are highly differentiated transcription domains. manipulating the affinity of svb enhancers revealed an inverse relationship between enhancer affinity and ubx concentration required for transcriptional activation. the ubx cofactor, homothorax (hth), was co-enriched with ubx near enhancers that require hth, even though ubx and hth did not co-localize throughout the nucleus. thus, microenvironments of high local transcription factor and cofactor concentrations could help low-affinity sites overcome their kinetic inefficiency. mechanisms that generate these microenvironments could be a general feature of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.

the insect wing is a key evolutionary innovation that was essential for insect diversification. yet despite its importance, there is still debate about its evolutionary origins. two main hypotheses have been proposed: the paranotal hypothesis, which suggests that wings evolved as an extension of the dorsal thorax, and the gill-exite hypothesis, which proposes that wings were derived from a modification of a pre-existing branch at the dorsal base (subcoxa) of the leg. here, we address this question by studying how wing fates are initially specified during drosophila embryogenesis, by characterizing a cis-regulatory module (crm) from the snail (sna) gene, sna-dp (for dorsal primordia). sna-dp specifically marks the early primordia for both the wing and haltere, collectively referred to as the dp. we found that the inputs that activate sna-dp are distinct from those that activate distalless, a marker for leg fates. further, in genetic backgrounds in which the leg primordia are absent, the dp are still partially specified. however, lineage-tracing experiments demonstrate that cells from the early leg primordia contribute to both ventral and dorsal appendage fates. together, these results suggest that the wings of drosophila have a dual developmental origin: two groups of cells, one ventral and one more dorsal, give rise to the mature wing. we suggest that the dual developmental origins of the wing may be a molecular remnant of the evolutionary history of this appendage, in which cells of the subcoxa of the leg coalesced with dorsal outgrowths to evolve a dorsal appendage with motor control.

regular overconsumption of sugar is associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes, but how genetic factors contribute to variable sugar preferences and intake levels remains mostly unclear. here we provide evidence for the usefulness of a drosophila larva model to investigate genetic influence on vulnerability to sugar overconsumption. using genetic and rna interference approaches, we show that the activity of the oamb gene, which encodes a receptor for octopamine (oa, the invertebrate homologue of norepinephrine), plays a major role in controlled sugar consumption. furthermore, oamb appears to suppress sugar food intake in fed larvae in an acute manner, and neurons expressing this oamb receptor do not overlap with neurons expressing octβ3r, another oa receptor previously implicated in hunger-driven exuberant sugar intake. together, these results suggest that two separate sub-circuits, defined by oamb and octβ3r respectively, co-regulate sugar consumption according to changes in energy needs. we propose that the noradrenergic-like system defines an ancient regulatory mechanism for prevention of sugar overload.

evolutionary analysis of cis-regulatory dna reveals that enhancers consist of clusters of conserved sequence blocks (csbs) that are made up of both unique and repeated sequence elements. this study seeks to address the basis for spatial and temporal regulation of neuroblas. a search for temporally restricted cns nb enhancers identified one within the transcription factor grainyhead (grh) gene locus. the intronic enhancer, grh-15, contains two separable semi-autonomous activities, one that drives expression predominantly within the developing brain nbs and another in ventral cord nbs. to gain insight into the function of the csbs constituting the brain-specific enhancer, we have systematically deleted each csb and compared the activity of the altered enhancer to that of the full brain-specific enhancer. while our results indicate that information regulating enhancer activity is highly redundant, we have found that individual csbs convey expression in subsets of larval lineages that are generated from either type i or type ii nbs. these studies also highlight how evolutionary sequence conservation can be used as a guide the functional analysis of cis-regulatory dna.

the hmg-box protein capicua (cic) is a conserved transcriptional repressor that functions downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) signaling pathways in a relatively simple switch: in the absence of signaling, cic represses rtk-responsive genes by binding to nearly invariant sites in dna, whereas activation of rtk signaling down-regulates cic activity, leading to derepression of its targets. this mechanism controls gene expression in both drosophila and mammals, but whether cic can also function via other regulatory mechanisms remains unknown. here, we characterize an rtk-independent role of cic in regulating spatially restricted expression of toll/il-1 signaling targets in drosophila embryogenesis. we show that cic represses those targets by binding to suboptimal dna sites of lower affinity than its known consensus sites. this binding depends on dorsal/nf-κb, which translocates into the nucleus upon toll activation and binds next to the cic sites. as a result, cic binds to and represses toll targets only in regions with nuclear dorsal. these results reveal a mode of cic regulation unrelated to the well-established rtk/cic depression axis and implicate cooperative binding in conjunction with low-affinity binding sites as an important mechanism of enhancer regulation. given that cic plays a role in many developmental and pathological processes in mammals, our results raise the possibility that some of these cic functions are independent of rtk regulation and may depend on cofactor-assisted dna binding.

walking is a complex rhythmic locomotor behavior generated by sequential and periodical contraction of muscles essential for coordinated control of movements of legs and leg joints. studies of walking in vertebrates and invertebrates have revealed that premotor neural circuitry generates a basic rhythmic pattern that is sculpted by sensory feedback and ultimately controls the amplitude and phase of the motor output to leg muscles. however, the identity and functional roles of the premotor interneurons that directly control leg motoneuron activity are poorly understood. here we take advantage of the powerful genetic methodology available in drosophila to investigate the role of premotor inhibition in walking by genetically suppressing inhibitory input to leg motoneurons. for this, we have developed an algorithm for automated analysis of leg motion to characterize the walking parameters of wild-type flies from high-speed video recordings. further, we use genetic reagents for targeted rnai knockdown of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in leg motoneurons together with quantitative analysis of resulting changes in leg movement parameters in freely walking drosophila our findings indicate that targeted down-regulation of the gabaa receptor rdl (resistance to dieldrin) in leg motoneurons results in a dramatic reduction of walking speed and step length without the loss of general leg coordination during locomotion. genetically restricting the knockdown to the adult stage and subsets of motoneurons yields qualitatively identical results. taken together, these findings identify gabaergic premotor inhibition of motoneurons as an important determinant of correctly coordinated leg movements and speed of walking in freely behaving drosophila.

understanding how gene regulatory networks control the progressive restriction of cell fates is a long-standing challenge. recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into lineage commitment. however, the regulatory events underlying these changes remain unclear. here we investigate the dynamics of chromatin regulatory landscapes during embryogenesis at single-cell resolution. using single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (sci-atac-seq), we profiled chromatin accessibility in over 20,000 single nuclei from fixed drosophila melanogaster embryos spanning three landmark embryonic stages: 2-4 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 5 blastoderm nuclei), when each embryo comprises around 6,000 multipotent cells; 6-8 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 10-11), to capture a midpoint in embryonic development when major lineages in the mesoderm and ectoderm are specified; and 10-12 h after egg laying (predominantly stage 13), when each of the embryo's more than 20,000 cells are undergoing terminal differentiation. our results show that there is spatial heterogeneity in the accessibility of the regulatory genome before gastrulation, a feature that aligns with future cell fate, and that nuclei can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. during mid-embryogenesis, tissue granularity emerges such that individual cell types can be inferred by their chromatin accessibility while maintaining a signature of their germ layer of origin. analysis of the data reveals overlapping usage of regulatory elements between cells of the endoderm and non-myogenic mesoderm, suggesting a common developmental program that is reminiscent of the mesendoderm lineage in other species. we identify 30,075 distal regulatory elements that exhibit tissue-specific accessibility. we validated the germ-layer specificity of a subset of these predicted enhancers in transgenic embryos, achieving an accuracy of 90%. overall, our results demonstrate the power of shotgun single-cell profiling of embryos to resolve dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape during development, and to uncover the cis-regulatory programs of metazoan germ layers and cell types.

in insects, juvenile hormone (jh) and the steroid hormone ecdysone have opposing effects on regulation of the larval-pupal transition. although increasing evidence suggests that jh represses ecdysone biosynthesis during larval development, the mechanism underlying this repression is not well understood. here, we demonstrate that the expression of the krüppel homolog 1 (kr-h1), a gene encoding a transcription factor that mediates jh signaling, in ecdysone-producing organ prothoracic gland (pg) represses ecdysone biosynthesis by directly inhibiting the transcription of steroidogenic enzymes in both drosophila and bombyx application of a jh mimic on ex vivo cultured pgs from drosophila and bombyx larvae induces kr-h1 expression and inhibits the transcription of steroidogenic enzymes. in addition, pg-specific knockdown of drosophila kr-h1 promotes-while overexpression hampers-ecdysone production and pupariation. we further find that kr-h1 inhibits the transcription of steroidogenic enzymes by directly binding to their promoters to induce promoter dna methylation. finally, we show that kr-h1 does not affect dna replication in drosophila pg cells and that the reduction of pg size mediated by kr-h1 overexpression can be rescued by feeding ecdysone. taken together, our data indicate direct and conserved kr-h1 repression of insect ecdysone biosynthesis in response to jh stimulation, providing insights into mechanisms underlying the antagonistic roles of jh and ecdysone.

understanding how cellular identity naturally interconverts with high efficiency and temporospatial precision is crucial for regenerative medicine. here, we revealed a natural midgut-to-renal lineage conversion event during drosophila metamorphosis and identified the evolutionarily-conserved homeodomain protein cut as a master switch in this process. a steep wnt/wingless morphogen gradient intersects with a pulse of steroid hormone ecdysone to induce cut expression in a subset of midgut progenitors and reprogram them into renal progenitors. molecularly, ecdysone-induced temporal factor broad physically interacts with cut enhancer-bound wnt pathway effector tcf/β-catenin and likely bridges the distant enhancer and promoter region of cut through its self-association. such long-range enhancer-promoter looping could subsequently trigger timely cut transcription. our results therefore led us to propose an unexpected poising-and-bridging mechanism whereby spatial and temporal cues intersect, likely via chromatin looping, to turn on a master transcription factor and dictate efficient and precise lineage reprogramming.

intestinal infection triggers potent immune responses to combat pathogens and concomitantly drives epithelial renewal to maintain barrier integrity. current models propose that epithelial renewal is primarily driven by damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ros). here we found that in drosophila, the imd-nf-κb pathway controlled enterocyte (ec) shedding upon infection, via a mechanism independent of ros-associated apoptosis. mechanistically, the imd pathway synergized with jnk signaling to induce epithelial cell shedding specifically in the context of bacterial infection, requiring also the reduced expression of the transcription factor gatae. furthermore, cell-specific nf-κb responses enabled simultaneous production of antimicrobial peptides (amps) and epithelial shedding in different ec populations. thus, the imd-nf-κb pathway is central to the intestinal antibacterial response by mediating both amp production and the maintenance of barrier integrity. considering the similarities between drosophila imd signaling and mammalian tnfr pathway, our findings suggest the existence of an evolutionarily conserved genetic program in immunity-induced epithelial shedding.

we have analyzed the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the drosophila melanogaster rh2 gene that encodes the protein component of a rhodopsin which is expressed in ocellar photoreceptor cells. dna fragments containing the start point of transcription of the rh2 gene were fused to either the escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) or lacz (beta-galactosidase) genes and introduced into the drosophila germline by p-element-mediated transformation. expression of the e. coli genes was then used to assay the ability of various sequences from the rh2 gene to confer upon the indicator genes the rh2 pattern of expression. fragments containing between 4.3 kb and 183 bp upstream of the start of transcription plus the first 32 bp of the 5'-untranslated leader were found to result in nearly identical levels of head-specific cat expression. deletion of rh2 sequences distal to position -112 bp resulted in loss of detectable cat expression from these rh2/cat fusion constructs. we have, therefore, defined a region essential for head-specific expression of the rh2 gene to a region extending from -183 to -112. we have determined the dna sequence of the rh2 promoter from -448 to +32 and have found an 11-bp sequence which is also present in the upstream flanking sequences of two other photoreceptor-specific genes (ninae and ninac). by histochemical staining of beta-galactosidase expressed under the control of the rh2 promoter and by analyzing the effect of the ocelliless mutation on the expression of an rh2/cat fusion gene, we have been able to demonstrate that this promoter is active in ocelli.

proper tissue patterning is an essential step during organ formation. during this process, genes are expressed in distinct patterns, defining boundaries for future functional domains. the bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling pathway sets the anterior domain during eggshell patterning. previously, the drosophila melanogaster homolog of bmpr2, wishful thinking (wit), was shown to be required for bmp signaling and patterning during eggshell formation. expressed in a conserved anterior pattern, the width of wit patterning in the follicular epithelium is evolutionarily divergent between drosophila species. we used genome editing to demonstrate how the gene pattern divergence is controlled in cis within the wit locus of d. virilis furthermore, unlike direct targets of bmp signaling, we demonstrate how one transcription factor binding site shapes the pattern of wit in d. melanogaster by negative regulation. however, changes in this site are not sufficient to explain the evolution of wit patterning, suggesting that a positive regulatory element that controls pattern divergence remains to be discovered.

genetic variation influencing levels of gene expression is abundant in natural populations, and may exert its effects through complex mechanisms that depend on an organism's genetic background and the tissue in which expression is measured. we investigated natural variation in gene expression in the malpighian tubules of three inbred drosophila melanogaster strains and their f1 hybrids. one of the strains was from a population in the species' ancestral range (zambia), while the other two were from a more recently derived population (sweden). although closely related, the two swedish strains differed greatly in terms of their expression inheritance when hybridized with the zambian strain, with one swedish strain showing a large excess of genes with recessive expression inheritance, as well as a large number of genes with overdominant inheritance. although most expression variation could be attributed to trans-regulation, there were ∼200 genes that showed allele-specific expression differences in each of the between-population hybrids, indicating that cis-regulation contributes as well. the cis-regulated genes were enriched with cytochrome p450 genes, and the upstream regions of six of these genes were incorporated into transgenic reporter gene constructs to test their effects on expression. differential expression was observed for five of the six reporter genes in the malpighian tubule, suggesting that a large proportion of cis-regulatory variation lies directly upstream of the affected gene. in most cases, the differential expression was specific to the malpighian tubule or greater in this tissue than in the rest of the body, highlighting the importance of single-tissue studies of gene expression variation.

a challenge for evolutionary research is to uncover how new morphological traits evolve the coordinated spatial and temporal expression patterns of genes that govern their formation during development. detailed studies are often limited to characterizing how one or a few genes contributed to a trait's emergence, and thus our knowledge of how entire grns evolve their coordinated expression of each gene remains unresolved. the melanic color patterns decorating the male abdominal tergites of drosophila (d.) melanogaster evolved in part by novel expression patterns for genes acting at the terminus of a pigment metabolic pathway, driven by cis-regulatory elements (cres) with distinct mechanisms of hox regulation. here, we examined the expression and evolutionary histories of two important enzymes in this pathway, encoded by the pale and ddc genes. we found that while both genes exhibit dynamic patterns of expression, a robust pattern of ddc expression specifically evolved in the lineage of fruit flies with pronounced melanic abdomens. derived ddc expression requires the activity of a cre previously shown to activate expression in response to epidermal wounding. we show that a binding site for the grainy head transcription factor that promotes the ancestral wound healing function of this cre is also required for abdominal activity. together with previous findings in this system, our work shows how the grn for a novel trait emerged by assembling unique yet similarly functioning cres from heterogeneous starting points.

while developmental studies of drosophila neural stem cell lineages have identified transcription factors (tfs) important to cell identity decisions, currently only an incomplete understanding exists of the cis-regulatory elements that control the dynamic expression of these tfs. our previous studies have identified multiple enhancers that regulate the pou-domain tf paralogs nubbin and pdm-2 genes. evolutionary comparative analysis of these enhancers reveals that they each contain multiple conserved sequence blocks (csbs) that span tf dna-binding sites for known regulators of neuroblast (nb) gene expression in addition to novel sequences. this study functionally analyzes the conserved dna sequence elements within a nb enhancer located within the nubbin gene and highlights a high level of complexity underlying enhancer structure. mutational analysis has revealed csbs that are important for enhancer activation and silencing in the developing cns. we have also observed that adjusting the number and relative positions of the tf binding sites within these csbs alters enhancer function.

"developmental patterning involves the progressive subdivision of tissue into different cell types by invoking different genetic programs. in particular, cell-cell signaling is a universally deployed means of specifying distinct cell fates in adjacent cells. for this mechanism to be effective, it is essential that an asymmetry be established in the signaling and responding capacities of the participating cells. here we focus on the regulatory mechanisms underlying the role of the neuralized gene and its protein product in establishing and maintaining asymmetry of signaling through the notch pathway. the context is the classical process of ""lateral inhibition"" within drosophila proneural clusters, which is responsible for distinguishing the sensory organ precursor (sop) and non-sop fates among adjacent cells. we find that neur is directly regulated in proneural clusters by both proneural transcriptional activators and enhancer of split basic helix-loop-helix repressors (bhlh-rs), via two separate cis-regulatory modules within the neur locus. we show that this bhlh-r regulation is required to prevent the early, pre-sop expression of neur from being maintained in a subset of non-sops following sop specification. lastly, we demonstrate that neur activity in the sop is required to inhibit, in a cell non-autonomous manner, both neur expression and neur function in non-sops, thus helping to secure the robust establishment of distinct cell identities within the developing proneural cluster."

constructions containing the drosophila white gene and different amounts and arrangements of its regulatory region were introduced into the germ line of white mutant flies by p-mediated transformation. the results obtained with the different transposon constructions show that different parts of the 1.8-kb region preceding the transcription start are required for the expression of the gene in different tissues and at different developmental stages. different sequences independently control the expression of the gene in the adult testes, in the larval and adult malpighian tubules and in the eye. another sequence located greater than 1080 bp upstream of the transcription start is the target of zeste interaction. the results also suggest that sequences required for dosage compensation are contained between -216 and the transcription start site. we show that at least some of these regulatory elements are equally functional if their distance from the promoter is varied or if their orientation is inverted. their properties suggest that they act as enhancer-like elements to regulate the activity of the white promoter and, at least in the case of the zeste regulatory site, that they can act also in 'trans' on a white promoter locked in close physical proximity by homologous chromosome pairing.

growth and patterning are coordinated during development to define organ size and shape. the growth, proliferation and differentiation of drosophila wings are regulated by several conserved signaling pathways. here, we show that the salvador-warts-hippo (swh) and notch pathways converge on an enhancer in the expanded (ex) gene, which also responds to levels of the bhlh transcription factor daughterless (da). separate cis-regulatory elements respond to salvador-warts-hippo (swh) and notch pathways, to bhlh proteins, and to unidentified factors that repress ex transcription in the wing pouch and in the proneural region at the anterior wing margin. senseless, a zinc-finger transcription factor acting in proneural regions, had a negative impact on ex transcription in the proneural region, but the transcriptional repressor hairy had no effect. our study suggests that a complex pattern of ex transcription results from integration of a uniform swh signal with multiple other inputs, rather than from a pattern of swh signaling.

drosophila body pigmentation has emerged as a major evo-devo model. using two drosophila melanogaster lines, dark and pale, selected from a natural population, we analyse here the interaction between genetic variation and environmental factors to produce this complex trait. indeed, pigmentation varies with genotype in natural populations and is sensitive to temperature during development. we demonstrate that the bric à brac (bab) genes, that are differentially expressed between the two lines and whose expression levels vary with temperature, participate in the pigmentation difference between the dark and pale lines. the two lines differ in a bab regulatory sequence, the dimorphic element (called here bde). both bde alleles are temperature-sensitive, but the activity of the bde allele from the dark line is lower than that of the bde allele from the pale line. our results suggest that this difference could partly be due to differential regulation by abdb. bab has been previously reported to be a repressor of abdominal pigmentation. we show here that one of its targets in this process is the pigmentation gene tan (t), regulated via the tan abdominal enhancer (t_mse). furthermore, t expression is strongly modulated by temperature in the two lines. thus, temperature sensitivity of t expression is at least partly a consequence of bab thermal transcriptional plasticity. we therefore propose that a gene regulatory network integrating both genetic variation and temperature sensitivity modulates female abdominal pigmentation. interestingly, both bde and t_mse were previously shown to have been recurrently involved in abdominal pigmentation evolution in drosophilids. we propose that the environmental sensitivity of these enhancers has turned them into evolutionary hotspots.

in a previous bioinformatics analysis we identified 10 conserved drosophila melanogaster sequences that reside upstream from protein coding genes (cgs). here we characterize one of these genomic regions, which constitutes a drosophila melanogaster cis-regulatory module (crm) that we denominate tt-crm. the tt-crm is 646 bp long and is located in one of the introns of cg32239 and resides about 3,500 bp upstream of cg13711 and about 620 bp upstream of cg12493. analysis of 646 bp-lacz lines revealed that tt-crm drives gene expression not only to the larval, prepupal, and pupal tracheal system but also to the adult dorsal longitudinal muscles. the patterns of mrna expression of the transgene and of the cgs that lie in the vicinity of tt-crm were investigated both in dissected trachea and in adult thoraces. through rt-qpcr we observed that in the tracheal system the pattern of expression of 646 bp-lacz is similar to the pattern of expression of cg32239 and cg13711, whereas in the thoracic muscles 646 bp-lacz expression accompanies the expression of cg12493. together, these results suggest new functions for two previously characterized d. melanogaster genes and also contribute to the initial characterization of a novel crm that drives a dynamic pattern of expression throughout development.

we have used the p-element-mediated transformation of drosophila germ line to study the 5' dna sequences involved in the thermal inducibility of the genes for heat shock proteins hsp23 and 26. the results are strikingly different from those previously obtained in heterologous systems. for hsp23, each successive shortening of the promoter region from 618 to 402, 321 and 263 bp clearly decreased the expression. a construct with only 149 bp was not inducible at all. for hsp26, all the regulatory elements appear to be clustered in the first 350 bp upstream from the cap site. clones with 171 bp showed a 4- to 10-fold decrease in induction depending on the transformed line, and those with only 52 bp were not expressed. the results suggest that at least three pelham consensus sequences are required for the full expression of these two genes. the direct involvement of one of these consensus sequences has been assessed: a 6-bp deletion within the proximal element of the hsp26 gene strongly reduced its inducibility. our results also indicate that x-linked hsp genes exhibit either partial dosage compensation or none at all.

background: the formation of matured and individual sperm involves a series of molecular and spectacular morphological changes of the developing cysts in drosophila melanogaster testis. recent advances in rna sequencing (rna-seq) technology help us to understand the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes by dissecting different tissues and developmental stages of organisms. to gain a better understanding of cellular differentiation of spermatogenesis, we applied rna-seq to analyse the testis-specific transcriptome, including coding and non-coding genes. results: we isolated three different parts of the wild-type testis by dissecting and cutting the different regions: 1.) the apical region, which contains stem cells and developing spermatocytes 2.) the middle region, with enrichment of meiotic cysts 3.) the basal region, which contains elongated post-meiotic cysts with spermatids. total rna was isolated from each region and analysed by next-generation sequencing. we collected data from the annotated 17412 drosophila genes and identified 5381 genes with significant transcript accumulation differences between the regions, representing the main stages of spermatogenesis. we demonstrated for the first time the presence and region specific distribution of 2061 lncrnas in testis, with 203 significant differences. using the available modencode rna-seq data, we determined the tissue specificity indices of drosophila genes. combining the indices with our results, we identified genes with region-specific enrichment in testis. conclusion: by multiple analyses of our results and integrating existing knowledge about drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis to our dataset, we were able to describe transcript composition of different regions of drosophila testis, including several stage-specific transcripts. we present searchable visualizations that can facilitate the identification of new components that play role in the organisation and composition of different stages of spermatogenesis, including the less known, but complex regulation of post-meiotic stages.

through analysis of the drosophila ionotropic receptors (irs), a family of variant ionotropic glutamate receptors, we reveal that most irs are expressed in peripheral neuron populations in diverse gustatory organs in larvae and adults. we characterise ir56d, which defines two anatomically-distinct neuron classes in the proboscis: one responds to carbonated solutions and fatty acids while the other represents a subset of sugar- and fatty acid-sensing cells. mutational analysis indicates that ir56d, together with the broadly-expressed co-receptors ir25a and ir76b, is essential for physiological responses to carbonation and fatty acids, but not sugars. we further demonstrate that carbonation and fatty acids both promote ir56d-dependent attraction of flies, but through different behavioural outputs. our work provides a toolkit for investigating taste functions of irs, defines a subset of these receptors required for carbonation sensing, and illustrates how the gustatory system uses combinatorial expression of sensory molecules in distinct neurons to coordinate behaviour.

we have analyzed the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the ninae gene. this gene encodes the major drosophila melanogaster opsin, the protein component of the primary chromophore of photo-receptor cells r1-r6 of the adult eye. dna fragments containing the start point of transcription of the ninae gene were fused to either the escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or lacz (beta-galactosidase) gene and introduced into the drosophila germline by p-element-mediated transformation. expression of the e. coli genes was then used to assay the ability of various sequences from the ninae gene to confer the ninae pattern of expression. fragments containing between 2.8 kb and 215 bp of the sequences upstream of the start of transcription plus the first 67 bp of the untranslated leader were able to direct nearly wild-type expression. we have identified three separable control regions in the ninae promoter. the first, which has the properties of an enhancer element, is located between nucleotides -501 and -219. the removal of this sequence had little effect on promoter function; this sequence appears to be redundant. however, it appears to be able to substitute for the second control region which is located between nucleotides -215 and -162, and which also affects the level of output from this promoter. removal of these two control regions resulted in a 30-fold decrease in expression; however tissue specificity was not affected. the third control region, located downstream from nucleotide -120, appears to be absolutely necessary for promoter function in the absence of the first two regulatory sequences. examination of larvae containing fusion genes expressing beta-galactosidase suggests that the ninae gene is also expressed in a subset of cells in the larval photoreceptor organ.

retrograde bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling in neurons is essential for the differentiation and synaptic function of many neuronal subtypes. bmp signaling regulates these processes via smad transcription factor activity, yet the scope and nature of smad-dependent gene regulation in neurons are mostly unknown. here, we applied a computational approach to predict smad-binding cis-regulatory bmp-activating elements (bmp-aes) in drosophila, followed by transgenic in vivo reporter analysis to test their neuronal subtype enhancer activity in the larval central nervous system (cns). we identified 34 bmp-ae-containing genomic fragments that are responsive to bmp signaling in neurons, and showed that the embedded bmp-aes are required for this activity. rna-seq analysis identified bmp-responsive genes in the cns and revealed that bmp-aes selectively enrich near bmp-activated genes. these data suggest that functional bmp-aes control nearby bmp-activated genes, which we validated experimentally. finally, we demonstrated that the bmp-ae motif mediates a conserved smad-responsive function in the drosophila and vertebrate cns. our results provide evidence that bmp signaling controls neuronal function by directly coordinating the expression of a battery of genes through widespread deployment of a conserved smad-responsive cis-regulatory motif.

"the elimination of unfit cells from a tissue is a process known in drosophila and mammals as cell competition. in a well-studied paradigm ""loser"" cells that are heterozygous mutant for a haploinsufficient ribosomal protein gene are eliminated from developing tissues via apoptosis when surrounded by fitter wild-type cells, referred to as ""winner"" cells. however, the mechanisms underlying the induction of this phenomenon are not fully understood. here we report that a ccaat-enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp), xrp1, which is known to help maintaining genomic stability after genotoxic stress, is necessary for the elimination of loser clones in cell competition. in loser cells, xrp1 is transcriptionally upregulated by an autoregulatory loop and is able to trigger apoptosis - driving cell elimination. we further show that xrp1 acts in the nucleus to regulate the transcription of several genes that have been previously involved in cell competition. we therefore speculate that xrp1 might play a fundamental role as a molecular caretaker of the genomic integrity of tissues."

producing mature spermatozoa is essential for sexual reproduction in metazoans. spermiogenesis involves dramatic cell morphological changes going from sperm tail elongation and nuclear reshaping to cell membrane remodeling during sperm individualization and release. the sperm manchette plays a critical scaffolding function during nuclear remodeling by linking the nuclear lamina to the cytoskeleton. here, we describe the role of an uncharacterized protein in drosophila, salto/cg13164, involved in nuclear shaping and spermatid individualization. salto has dynamic localization during spermatid differentiation, being progressively relocated from the sperm-nuclear dense body, which is equivalent to the mammalian sperm manchette, to the centriolar adjunct and acrosomal cap during spermiogenesis. salto-null male flies are sterile and exhibit complete spermatid individualization defects. salto-deficient spermatids show coiled spermatid nuclei at late maturation stages and stalled individualization complexes. our work sheds light on a novel component involved in cytoskeleton-based cell-morphological changes during spermiogenesis.

natural aggressiveness is commonly observed in all animal species, and is displayed frequently when animals compete for food, territory and mating. aggression is an innate behaviour, and is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. however, the genetics of aggression remains largely unclear. in this study, we identify the peacefulness (pfs) gene as a novel player in the control of male-male aggression in drosophila. mutations in pfs decreased intermale aggressiveness, but did not affect locomotor activity, olfactory avoidance response and sexual behaviours. pfs encodes for the evolutionarily conserved molybdenum cofactor (moco) synthesis 1 protein (mocs1), which catalyzes the first step in the moco biosynthesis pathway. neuronal-specific knockdown of pfs decreased aggressiveness. by contrast, overexpression of pfs greatly increased aggressiveness. knocking down cinnamon (cin) catalyzing the final step in the moco synthesis pathway, caused a pfs-like aggression phenotype. in humans, inhibition of moco-dependent enzymes displays anti-aggressive effects. thus, the control of aggression by pfs-dependent moco pathways may be conserved throughout evolution.

pumilio (pum), an rna-binding protein, is a key component of neuron firing-rate homeostasis that likely maintains stability of neural circuit activity in all animals, from flies to mammals. while pum is ubiquitously expressed, we understand little about how synaptic excitation regulates its expression in the cns. here, we characterized the drosophila dpum promoter and identified multiple myocyte enhancer factor-2 (mef2)-binding elements. we cloned 12 dmef2 splice variants and used a luciferase-based assay to monitor dpum promoter activity. while all 12 dmef2 splice variants enhance dpum promoter activity, exon 10-containing variants induce greater transactivation. previous work shows dpum expression increases with synaptic excitation. however, we observe no change in dmef2 transcript in larval cns, of both sexes, exposed to the proconvulsant picrotoxin. the lack of activity dependence is indicative of additional regulation. we identified p300 as a potential candidate. we show that by binding to dmef2, p300 represses dpum transactivation. significantly, p300 transcript is downregulated by enhanced synaptic excitation (picrotoxin) which, in turn, increases transcription of dpum through derepression of dmef2. these results advance our understanding of dpum by showing the activity-dependent expression is regulated by an interaction between p300 and dmef2.

two drosophila mutants km75 and hh5, which are mutated in the act88f actin gene specific for the indirect flight muscles (ifm), synthesize heat shock proteins (hsps) constitutively in a tissue-specific manner. we have introduced cloned mutant act88f genes into a strain containing the wild-type act88f allele by p-element-mediated transformation. flies transformed with a 4.05 kb km75 act88f gene fragment encoding the p42 actin variant express both p42 and hsps specifically in the ifm. using normal/mutant chimeric genes, the mutation sites of km75 and hh5 were mapped within the sequence encoding the last 72 amino acids of actin. an in vitro mutated gene encoding a protein that lacks the 72 carboxy-terminal amino acids also induces constitutive hsp synthesis.

cis-regulatory sequences known as enhancers play a key role in regulating gene expression. evolutionary changes in these dna sequences contribute to phenotypic evolution. the drosophila yellow gene, which is required for pigmentation, has emerged as a model system for understanding how cis-regulatory sequences evolve, providing some of the most detailed insights available into how activities of orthologous enhancers have diverged between species. here, we examine the evolution of yellow cis-regulatory sequences on a broader scale, by comparing the distribution and function of yellow enhancer activities throughout the 5' intergenic and intronic sequences of drosophila melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura, and d. willistoni we find that cis-regulatory sequences driving expression in a particular tissue are not as modular as previously described, but rather have many redundant and cryptic enhancer activities distributed throughout the regions surveyed. interestingly, cryptic enhancer activities of sequences from one species often drove patterns of expression observed in other species, suggesting that the frequent evolutionary changes in yellow expression observed among drosophila species may be facilitated by gaining and losing repression of preexisting cis-regulatory sequences.

spermatogenesis in drosophila melanogaster is characterized by a specific transcriptional program during the spermatocyte stage. transcription of thousands of genes is regulated by the interaction of several proteins or complexes, including a ttaf-containing tfiid variant, tmac, mediator, and chromatin interactors, e.g., bromodomain proteins. we addressed how distinct subsets of target genes are selected. we characterized the highly similar proteins tplus3a and tplus3b, which contain a plus3 domain and are enriched in the testis, mainly in spermatocytes. in tplus3a and tplus3b deletion mutants generated using the crispr/cas9 system, fertility was severely reduced and sperm showed defects during individualization. tplus3a and tplus3b heterodimerized with the bromodomain protein tbrd-1. to elucidate the role of the tplus3a and tplus3b proteins in transcriptional regulation, we determined the transcriptomes of tplus3a-tplus3b and tbrd-1 deletion mutants using next-generation sequencing (rna-seq) and compared them to that of the wild-type. tplus3a and tplus3b positively or negatively regulated the expression of nearly 400 genes; tbrd-1 regulated 1,500 genes. nearly 200 genes were regulated by both tplus3a and tplus3b and tbrd-1. tplus3a and tplus3b activated the y-chromosomal genes kl-3 and kl-5, which indicates that tplus3a and tplus3b proteins are required for the function of distinct classes of genes. tplus3a and tplus3b and tbrd-1 repress genes relevant for seminal fluid and heat shock. we hypothesize that tplus3a and tplus3b proteins are required to specify the general transcriptional program in spermatocytes.

transcription factor e93 is a steroid hormone ecdysone early response gene and plays crucial roles in both the degradation of larval tissues and the formation of adult organs during insect metamorphosis with the prepupal-pupal-adult transition. however, the molecular mechanism underlying e93 regulation is poorly understood. in this study, we found that specific knockdown of the e93 gene in the drosophila wing disrupted wing development. analyzing chip-seq signals for e93 in drosophila wing identified that the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene was a potential downstream target of e93. chip-pcr analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that e93 could bind to the dpp promoter and enhanced its activity. furthermore, the expressions of dpp and other components in the dpp signaling pathway were upregulated following e93 overexpression in drosophila s2 cells but were decreased after e93 knockdown in the wing. moreover, the impairment of the dpp signaling pathway phenocopied the defects of e93 knockdown on wing development. taken together, our results suggest that e93 modulates the dpp signaling pathway to regulate wing development during drosophila metamorphosis.

we delimited sequences necessary for in vivo expression of the drosophila melanogaster dopa decarboxylase gene ddc. the expression of in vitro-altered genes was assayed following germ line integration via p-element vectors. sequences between -209 and -24 were necessary for normally regulated expression, although genes lacking these sequences could be expressed at 10 to 50% of wild-type levels at specific developmental times. these genes showed components of normal developmental expression, which suggests that they retain some regulatory elements. all ddc genes lacking the normal immediate 5'-flanking sequences were grossly deficient in larval central nervous system expression. thus, this upstream region must contain at least one element necessary for this expression. a mutated ddc gene without a normal tata boxlike sequence used the normal rna start points, indicating that this sequences is not required for start point specificity.

the regulation of transcription initiation is critical for developmental and cellular processes. rna polymerase ii (pol ii) is recruited by the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter where pol ii initiates transcription. the core promoter encompasses the region from -40 to +40 bp relative to the +1 transcription start site (tss). core promoters may contain one or more core promoter motifs that confer specific properties to the core promoter, such as the tata box, initiator (inr) and motifs that are located downstream of the tss, namely, motif 10 element (mte), the downstream core promoter element (dpe) and the bridge, a bipartite core promoter element. we had previously shown that caudal, an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor and a key regulator of the hox gene network, is a dpe-specific activator. interestingly, pair-rule proteins have been implicated in enhancer-promoter communication at the engrailed locus. fushi tarazu (ftz) is an enhancer-binding homeodomain transcription factor encoded by the ftz pair-rule gene. ftz works in concert with its co-factor, ftz-f1, to activate transcription. here, we examined whether ftz and ftz-f1 activate transcription with a preference for a specific core promoter motif. our analysis revealed that similarly to caudal, ftz and ftz-f1 activate the promoter containing a tata box mutation to significantly higher levels than the promoter containing a dpe mutation, thus demonstrating a preference for the dpe motif. we further discovered that ftz target genes are enriched for a combination of functional downstream core promoter elements that are conserved among drosophila species. thus, the unique combination (inr, bridge and dpe) of functional downstream core promoter elements within ftz target genes highlights the complexity of transcriptional regulation via the core promoter in the transcription of different developmental gene regulatory networks.

the ecdysone pathway was among the first experimental systems employed to study the impact of steroid hormones on the genome. in drosophila and other insects, ecdysone coordinates developmental transitions, including wholesale transformation of the larva into the adult during metamorphosis. like other hormones, ecdysone controls gene expression through a nuclear receptor, which functions as a ligand-dependent transcription factor. although it is clear that ecdysone elicits distinct transcriptional responses within its different target tissues, the role of its receptor, ecr, in regulating target gene expression is incompletely understood. in particular, ecr initiates a cascade of transcription factor expression in response to ecdysone, making it unclear which ecdysone-responsive genes are direct ecr targets. here, we use the larval-to-prepupal transition of developing wings to examine the role of ecr in gene regulation. genome-wide dna binding profiles reveal that ecr exhibits widespread binding across the genome, including at many canonical ecdysone response genes. however, the majority of its binding sites reside at genes with wing-specific functions. we also find that ecr binding is temporally dynamic, with thousands of binding sites changing over time. rna-seq reveals that ecr acts as both a temporal gate to block precocious entry to the next developmental stage as well as a temporal trigger to promote the subsequent program. finally, transgenic reporter analysis indicates that ecr regulates not only temporal changes in target enhancer activity but also spatial patterns. together, these studies define ecr as a multipurpose, direct regulator of gene expression, greatly expanding its role in coordinating developmental transitions.

the drosophila transcription factor (tf) zfh1 has distinct roles compared to the cell lineage-determining tfs in almost all mesoderm-derived tissues. here, we link zfh1 to the well-characterized mesodermal transcriptional network. we identify five enhancers integrating upstream regulatory inputs from mesodermal tfs and directing zfh1 expression in mesoderm. most downstream zfh1-target genes are co-bound by mesodermal tfs, suggesting that zfh1 and mesodermal tfs act on the same sets of co-regulated genes during the development of certain mesodermal tissues. furthermore, we demonstrate that zfh1 is critical for the expression of a hemocyte marker gene peroxidasin and helps restrict the activity of a hemocyte-specific enhancer of serpent to hemocyte-deriving head mesoderm, suggesting a potential role of zfh1 in hemocyte development.

intercellular signaling pathways activate transcription factors, which, along with tissue-specific co-factors, regulate expression of target genes. responses to tgfβ/bmp signals are mediated by smad proteins, which form complexes and accumulate in the nucleus to directly bind and regulate enhancers of bmp targets upon signaling. in drosophila, gene activation by bmp signaling often requires, in addition to direct input by smads, the signal-dependent removal of the transcriptional repressor brk. previous studies on enhancers of bmp-activated genes have defined a bmp-responsive motif, the ae, which integrates activatory and repressive input by the smad complex and brk, respectively. here, we address whether sequence variations within the core ae sequences might endow the motif with additional properties accounting for qualitative and quantitative differences in bmp responses, including tissue specificity of transcriptional activation and differential sensitivity to smad and brk inputs. by analyzing and cross-comparing three distinct bmp-responsive enhancers from the genes wit and d ad in two different epithelia, the wing imaginal disc and the follicular epithelium, we demonstrate that differences in the aes contribute neither to the observed tissue-restriction of bmp responses nor to differences in the utilization of the smad and brk branches for transcriptional activation. rather, our results suggest that the cis-environment of the bmp-response elements not only dictates tissue specificity but also differential sensitivity to the two bmp mediators.

understanding the transcriptional pathways controlling tissue-specific gene expression is critical to unraveling the complex regulatory networks that underlie developmental mechanisms. here, we assessed how the drosophila crossveinless (cv) gene, that encodes a bmp-binding factor, is transcriptionally regulated in the developing embryonic tracheal system. we identify an upstream regulatory region of cv that promotes reporter gene expression in the tracheal precursors. we further demonstrate that this promoter region is directly responsive to the basic, helix-loop-helix-pas domain factors trachealess (trh) and tango (tgo), that function to specify tracheal fate. moreover, cv expression in embryos is lost in trh mutants, and the integrity of the trh/tgo binding sites are required for promoter-lacz expression. these findings for the first time elucidate the transcriptional regulation of one member of a family of bmp binding proteins, that have diverse functions in animal development.

to study the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, a convenient experimental approach is to use the artificial chimeric constructs carrying the regulatory elements of interest. in the present work, we describe the creation and characterization of a novel genetic construct that makes it possible to study the transcriptional regulation of the early-late gene of the ecdysone cascade. using the data of genome-wide experiments, we have isolated the main regulatory region of the hr4 gene, which was successfully used to create a chimeric reporter construct expressing a fluorescent protein upon the treatment with the ecdysone hormone. this reporter system can be used to study the mechanisms of the ecdysone response, both in cell culture and in tissues, at various stages of the drosophila development.

dna sequences involved in the control of the developmental and spatial expression of the yellow locus of drosophila were identified by phenotypic analysis of germline transformants carrying various in vitro modified yellow genes. two regions, located between -2873 bp and -1868 bp and between -1868 bp and -700 bp, act as tissue-specific enhancers which respectively regulate yellow transcription in the wings and body of the adult flies. sequences situated closer to the mrna cap site, between -225 bp and -91 bp from the start of transcription, are responsible for yellow expression in the denticle belts and mouth parts during larval development. finally, coloration of the adult bristles is regulated by sequences located in the intron of the yellow gene. these results indicate the existence of several separate dna elements responsible for the different patterns of temporal and spatial expression of the yellow locus.

the specification and morphogenesis of an organ requires the coordinate deployment and integration of regulatory information, including sex specific information when the organ is sex specific. only a few gene networks controlling size and pattern development have been deciphered, which limits the emergence of principles, general or not, underlying the organ-specifying gene networks. here we elucidate the genetic and molecular network determining the control of size in the drosophila abdominal a9 primordium, contributing to the female genitalia. this network requires axial regulatory information provided by the hox protein abdominal-br (abd-br), the hox cofactors extradenticle (exd) and homothorax (hth), and the sex specific transcription factor doublesex female (dsxf). these factors synergize to control size in the female a9 by the coordinate regulation of the decapentaplegic (dpp) growth pathway. molecular dissection of the dpp regulatory region and in vivo protein interaction experiments suggest that abd-br, exd, hth and dsxf coordinately regulate a short dpp enhancer to repress dpp expression and restrict female a9 size. the same regulators can also suppress dpp expression in the a8, but this requires the absence of the abd-bm isoform, which specifies a8. these results delineate the network controlling female a9 growth in drosophila.

precise control of stem cell (sc) proliferation ensures tissue homeostasis. in the drosophila intestine, injury-induced regeneration involves initial activation of intestinal sc (isc) proliferation and subsequent return to quiescence. these two phases of the regenerative response are controlled by differential availability of the bmp type i receptor thickveins (tkv), yet how its expression is dynamically regulated remains unclear. here we show that during homeostasis, the e3 ubiquitin ligase highwire and the ubiquitin-proteasome system maintain low tkv protein expression. after isc activation, tkv is stabilized by proteasome inhibition and undergoes endocytosis due to the induction of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase abnormal wing disc (awd). tkv internalization is required for the activation of the smad protein mad, and for the return to quiescence after a regenerative episode. our data provide insight into the mechanisms ensuring tissue homeostasis by dynamic control of somatic stem cell activity.

development of eye tissue is initiated by a conserved set of transcription factors termed retinal determination network (rdn). in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, the zinc-finger transcription factor glass acts directly downstream of the rdn to control identity of photoreceptor as well as non-photoreceptor cells. tight control of spatial and temporal gene expression is a critical feature during development, cell-fate determination as well as maintenance of differentiated tissues. the molecular mechanisms that control expression of glass, however, remain largely unknown. we here identify complex regulatory mechanisms controlling expression of the glass locus. all information to recapitulate glass expression are contained in a compact 5.2 kb cis-acting genomic element by combining different cell-type specific and general enhancers with repressor elements. moreover, the immature rna of the locus contains an alternative small open reading frame (smorf) upstream of the actual glass translation start, resulting in a small peptide instead of the three possible glass protein isoforms. crispr/cas9-based mutagenesis shows that the smorf is not required for the formation of functioning photoreceptors, but is able to attenuate effects of glass misexpression. furthermore, editing the genome to generate glass loci eliminating either one or two isoforms shows that only one of the three proteins is critical for formation of functioning photoreceptors, while removing the two other isoforms did not cause defects in developmental or photoreceptor function. our results show that eye development and function is largely unaffected by targeted manipulations of critical features of the glass transcript, suggesting a strong selection pressure to allow the formation of a functioning eye.

information from developmental signaling pathways must be accurately decoded to generate transcriptional outcomes. in the case of notch, the intracellular domain (nicd) transduces the signal directly to the nucleus. how enhancers decipher nicd in the real time of developmental decisions is not known. using the ms2-mcp system to visualize nascent transcripts in single cells in drosophila embryos, we reveal how two target enhancers read notch activity to produce synchronized and sustained profiles of transcription. by manipulating the levels of nicd and altering specific motifs within the enhancers, we uncover two key principles. first, increased nicd levels alter transcription by increasing duration rather than frequency of transcriptional bursts. second, priming of enhancers by tissue-specific transcription factors is required for nicd to confer synchronized and sustained activity; in their absence, transcription is stochastic and bursty. the dynamic response of an individual enhancer to nicd thus differs depending on the cellular context.

neuronal physiology is particularly sensitive to acute stressors that affect excitability, many of which can trigger seizures and epilepsies. although intrinsic neuronal homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining overall nervous system robustness and its resistance to stressors, the specific genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes are not well understood. here we used a reverse genetic approach in drosophila to test the hypothesis that specific voltage-gated ion channels contribute to neuronal homeostasis, robustness, and stress resistance. we found that the activity of the voltage-gated potassium channel seizure (sei), an ortholog of the mammalian erg channel family, is essential for protecting flies from acute heat-induced seizures. although sei is broadly expressed in the nervous system, our data indicate that its impact on the organismal robustness to acute environmental stress is primarily mediated via its action in excitatory neurons, the octopaminergic system, as well as neuropile ensheathing and perineurial glia. furthermore, our studies suggest that human mutations in the human erg channel (herg), which have been primarily implicated in the cardiac long qt syndrome (lqts), may also contribute to the high incidence of seizures in lqts patients via a cardiovascular-independent neurogenic pathway.

hox proteins belong to a family of transcription factors with similar dna binding specificities that control animal differentiation along the antero-posterior body axis. hox proteins are expressed in partially overlapping regions where each one is responsible for the formation of particular organs and structures through the regulation of specific direct downstream targets. thus, explaining how each hox protein can selectively control its direct targets from those of another hox protein is fundamental to understand animal development. here we analyse a cis regulatory module directly regulated by seven different drosophila hox proteins and uncover how different hox class proteins differentially control its expression. we find that regulation by one or another hox protein depends on the combination of three modes: hox-cofactor dependent dna-binding specificity; hox-monomer binding sites; and interaction with positive and negative hox-collaborator proteins. additionally, we find that similar regulation can be achieved by amphioxus orthologs, suggesting these three mechanisms are conserved from insects to chordates.

during the last day of larval development, the sgs-4 glue gene of drosophila melanogaster is expressed at high levels in a single tissue, the larval salivary glands. as shown by transformation experiments and by dna sequence analysis of sgs-4 underproducing strains, an essential regulatory region for sgs-4 expression lies between 149 and 568 bp upstream from the transcribed part of the gene. this region shows the positional independence of a transcriptional enhancer and directs at least three regulatory activities: tissue specificity, developmental timing and high-level expression. here we use a transient transformation assay to identify three elements within this enhancer that are involved in tissue specificity. for at least this regulatory activity the enhancer is internally redundant. any pairwise combination of the three elements is sufficient to direct salivary gland expression, although none of the three can act alone.

during organogenesis, inductive signals cause cell differentiation and morphogenesis. however, how these phenomena are coordinated to form functional organs is poorly understood. here, we show that cell differentiation of the drosophila trachea is sequentially determined in two steps and that the second step is synchronous with the invagination of the epithelial sheet. the master gene trachealess is dispensable for the initiation of invagination, while it is essential for maintaining the invaginated structure, suggesting that tracheal morphogenesis and differentiation are separately induced. trachealess expression starts in bipotential tracheal/epidermal placode cells. after invagination, its expression is maintained in the invaginated cells but is extinguished in the remaining sheet cells. a trachealess cis-regulatory module that shows both tracheal enhancer activity and silencer activity in the surface epidermal sheet was identified. we propose that the coupling of trachealess expression with the invaginated structure ensures that only invaginated cells canalize robustly into the tracheal fate.

proper development and maturation of a follicle is essential for successful ovulation and reproduction; however, the molecular mechanisms for follicle maturation, particularly for somatic follicle cell differentiation, are poorly understood. during drosophila oogenesis, the somatic follicle cells encasing oocytes undergo two distinct well-established transitions: the mitotic to endocycle switch at stage 6/7 and the endocycle to gene amplification switch at stage10a/10b. here, we identify a novel third follicle cell transition that occurs in the final stages of oogenesis (stage 13/14). this late follicle cell transition is characterized by upregulation of the transcription factor hindsight (hnt), and downregulation of the homeodomain transcription factor cut and the zinc-finger transcription factor tramtrack-69 (ttk69). we demonstrate that inducing expression of cut in stage 14 follicle cells is sufficient to inhibit follicle rupture and ovulation through its negative regulation of hnt and promotion of ttk69 expression. our work illustrates the importance of the stage13/14 transition for follicle maturation and demonstrates the complex regulation required for somatic follicle cells to differentiate into a state primed for follicle rupture and ovulation.

size trade-offs of visual versus olfactory organs is a pervasive feature of animal evolution. this could result from genetic or functional constraints. we demonstrate that head sensory organ size trade-offs in drosophila are genetically encoded and arise through differential subdivision of the head primordium into visual versus non-visual fields. we discover that changes in the temporal regulation of the highly conserved eyeless/pax6 gene expression during development is a conserved mechanism for sensory trade-offs within and between drosophila species. we identify a natural single nucleotide polymorphism in the cis-regulatory region of eyeless in a binding site of its repressor cut that is sufficient to alter its temporal regulation and eye size. because eyeless/pax6 is a conserved regulator of head sensory placode subdivision, we propose that its temporal regulation is key to define the relative size of head sensory organs.

protein phosphatase v (ppv) encodes the drosophila homolog of the evolutionarily conserved protein phosphatase 6 (pp6). the physiological and developmental functions of ppv/pp6 have not been well characterized due to lack of a genetically defined mutant. here, we identified a ppv non-sense mutation and describe multiple mutant phenotypes in oogenesis and early embryogenesis. specifically, we found that the defects in chromosome segregation during nuclear cycles are related to auroraa function, which is consistent with the interaction of pp6 and auroraa in mammalian cells. surprisingly, we also identified a ppv function specifically in blastoderm cell cycle but not in cell proliferation in the follicle epithelium or larval wing imaginal discs. embryos from ppv germline clones frequently undergo an extra nuclear division cycle. by epistasis analysis, we found that ppv functions in parallel with tribbles, but independently of auroraa for the remodeling of the nuclear cycles. taken together, this study reports novel developmental functions of ppv and provides a framework for further genetic analysis under physiological conditions.

specification of cell identity and the proper functioning of a mature cell depend on precise regulation of gene expression. both binary on/off regulation of transcription, as well as more fine-tuned control of transcription levels in the on state, are required to define cell types. the drosophila melanogaster hox gene, ultrabithorax (ubx), exhibits both of these modes of control during development. while on/off regulation is needed to specify the fate of the developing wing (ubx off) and haltere (ubx on), the levels of ubx within the haltere differ between compartments along the proximal-distal axis. here, we identify and molecularly dissect the novel contribution of a previously identified ubx cis-regulatory module (crm), anterobithorax (abx), to a negative auto-regulatory loop that decreases ubx expression in the proximal compartment of the haltere as compared to the distal compartment. we find that ubx, in complex with the known hox cofactors, homothorax (hth) and extradenticle (exd), acts through low-affinity ubx-exd binding sites to reduce the levels of ubx transcription in the proximal compartment. importantly, we also reveal that ubx-exd-binding site mutations sufficient to result in de-repression of abx activity in a transgenic context are not sufficient to de-repress ubx expression when mutated at the endogenous locus, suggesting the presence of multiple mechanisms through which ubx-mediated repression occurs. our results underscore the complementary nature of crm analysis through transgenic reporter assays and genome modification of the endogenous locus; but, they also highlight the increasing need to understand gene regulation within the native context to capture the potential input of multiple genomic elements on gene control.

transcriptional regulation of laminin expression during embryogenesis is a key step required for proper ecm assembly. we show, that in drosophila the laminin b1 and laminin b2 genes share expression patterns in mesodermal cells as well as in endodermal and ectodermal gut primordia, yolk and amnioserosa. in the absence of the gata transcription factor serpent, the spatial extend of laminin reporter gene expression was strongly limited, indicating that laminin expression in many tissues depends on serpent activity. we demonstrate a direct binding of serpent to the intronic enhancers of laminin b1 and laminin b2. in addition, ectopically expressed serpent activated enhancer elements of laminin b1 and laminin b2. our results reveal serpent as an important regulator of laminin expression across tissues.

background: while many developmentally relevant enhancers act in a modular fashion, there is growing evidence for nonadditive interactions between distinct cis-regulatory enhancers. we investigated if nonautonomous enhancer interactions underlie transcription regulation of the drosophila segment polarity gene, wingless. results: we identified two wg enhancers active at the blastoderm stage: wg 3613u, located from -3.6 to -1.3 kb upstream of the wg transcription start site (tss) and 3046d, located in intron two of the wg gene, from 3.0 to 4.6 kb downstream of the tss. genetic experiments confirm that even skipped (eve), fushi-tarazu (ftz), runt, odd-paired (opa), odd-skipped (odd), and paired (prd) contribute to spatially regulated wg expression. interestingly, there are enhancer specific differences in response to the gain or loss of function of pair-rule gene activity. although each element recapitulates aspects of wg expression, a composite reporter containing both enhancers more faithfully recapitulates wg regulation than would be predicted from the sum of their individual responses. conclusion: these results suggest that the regulation of wg by pair-rule genes involves nonadditive interactions between distinct cis-regulatory enhancers.

in drosophila, transcriptional feedback loops contribute to intracellular timekeeping mechanisms responsible for daily rhythms. pigment-dispersing factor (pdf) is the major neuropeptide produced by latero-ventral neurons (lnvs) that function as a central pacemaker for circadian locomotor activity rhythms. pdf synchronizes other clock neurons thereby playing an essential role in the maintenance and coordination of circadian locomotor rhythms. however, the underlying molecular mechanism of the lnvs-specific pdf expression is not well understood. here, using pdf promoter-bashing experiment, we identified a cis-acting pdf regulatory element (pre) that is sufficient for driving pdf expression in the lnvs. we have also identified a homeobox transcription factor, scarecrow (scro), as a direct binding factor to pre. furthermore, transgenic expression of scro in the clock neurons abolished pdf expression and circadian locomotor activity rhythms, and such repressive function requires dna-binding homeodomain, but none of the other conserved domains. scro is predominantly expressed in the optic lobe and various clusters of cells in other areas of the central nervous system. a homozygous scro-null mutant generated by cripsr is lethal during embryonic and early larval development, suggesting that scro plays a vital role during early development.

robust production of terminally differentiated cells from self-renewing resident stem cells is essential to maintain proper tissue architecture and physiological functions, especially in high-turnover tissues. however, the transcriptional networks that precisely regulate cell transition and differentiation are poorly understood in most tissues. here, we identified sox100b, a drosophila sox e family transcription factor, as a critical regulator of adult intestinal stem cell differentiation. sox100b is expressed in stem and progenitor cells and required for differentiation of enteroblast progenitors into absorptive enterocytes. mechanistically, sox100b regulates the expression of another critical stem cell differentiation factor, sox21a. supporting a direct control of sox21a by sox100b, we identified a sox21a intronic enhancer that is active in all intestinal progenitors and directly regulated by sox100b. taken together, our results demonstrate that the activity and regulation of two sox transcription factors are essential to coordinate stem cell differentiation and proliferation and maintain intestinal tissue homeostasis.

the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium is ensured by the controlled proliferation of intestinal stem cells (iscs) and differentiation of their progeny into various cell types, including enterocytes (ecs) that both mediate nutrient absorption and provide a barrier against pathogens. the signals that regulate transition of proliferative iscs into differentiated ecs are not fully understood. irbit is an evolutionarily conserved protein that regulates ribonucleotide reductase (rnr), an enzyme critical for the generation of dna precursors. here, we show that irbit expression in isc progeny within the drosophila midgut epithelium cells regulates their differentiation via suppression of rnr activity. disruption of this irbit-rnr regulatory circuit causes a premature loss of intestinal tissue integrity. furthermore, age-related dysplasia can be reversed by suppression of rnr activity in isc progeny. collectively, our findings demonstrate a role of the irbit-rnr pathway in gut homeostasis.

cell type-specific transcriptional programs that drive differentiation of specialized cell types are key players in development and tissue regeneration. one of the most dramatic changes in the transcription program in drosophila occurs with the transition from proliferating spermatogonia to differentiating spermatocytes, with >3000 genes either newly expressed or expressed from new alternative promoters in spermatocytes. here we show that opening of these promoters from their closed state in precursor cells requires function of the spermatocyte-specific tmac complex, localized at the promoters. the spermatocyte-specific promoters lack the previously identified canonical core promoter elements except for the inr. instead, these promoters are enriched for the binding site for the tale-class homeodomain transcription factors achi/vis and for a motif originally identified under tmac chip-seq peaks. the tmac motif resembles part of the previously identified 14-bp β2ue1 element critical for spermatocyte-specific expression. analysis of downstream sequences relative to transcription start site usage suggested that aca and cnaaatt motifs at specific positions can help promote efficient transcription initiation. our results reveal how promoter-proximal sequence elements that recruit and are acted upon by cell type-specific chromatin binding complexes help establish a robust, cell type-specific transcription program for terminal differentiation.

"we have used germ-line transformation to dissect the cis regulatory elements responsible for the transcriptional control of an internally marked drosophila chorion gene (s15-p) during development. a 73-base-pair segment of the proximal 5'-flanking dna contains sequences essential for the tissue-specific expression and the precise ""late"" temporal regulation of that gene. a substitute s36-1 segment of similar location can provide the tissue-specific function and imparts an early temporal regulation characteristic of gene s36-1. within the regulatory dna of s15-p, at least three adjacent elements are recognizable: an essential operationally positive element (tcacgt) that is shared by s36-1 and other chorion genes, irrespective of temporal specificity; a second positive element that is required for the normal late expression of s15-p; and, farthest upstream, a negative element that represses precocious expression during the early choriogenic stages."

"fushi tarazu (ftz) is one of the drosophila homeo-box-containing genes required to establish the segmental pattern. ftz+ transcripts accumulate in cells that form seven equally spaced bands at the blastoderm stage. we have analyzed cis-acting controlling sequences of the ftz gene by germ line transformation. the functional ftz gene includes a transcription unit of 1.9 kb and approximately 6.1 kb of the 5'-flanking sequences. fusion of the 5'-flanking sequences to the e. coli lacz gene directs expression of beta-galactosidase in a ""zebra"" pattern in transformed embryos. the fusion gene is also expressed in certain neuroblasts that contribute to ganglion cells of all segments. various morphogenetic controlling elements have been identified within the 5'-flanking sequences."

the fork head (fkh) domain defines the dna-binding region of a family of transcription factors which has been implicated in regulating cell fate decisions across species lines. we have cloned and molecularly characterized the crocodile (croc) gene which encodes a new family member from drosophila. croc is expressed in the head anlagen of the blastoderm embryo under the control of the anterior, the dorsoventral and the terminal maternal organizer systems. the croc mutant phenotype indicates that the croc wild-type gene is required to function as an early patterning gene in the anterior-most blastoderm head segment anlage and for the establishment of a specific head skeletal structure that derives from the non-adjacent intercalary segment at a later stage of embryogenesis. as an early patterning gene, croc exerts unusual properties which do not allow it to be grouped among the established segmentation genes. a single-site mutation within the croc fkh domain, which causes a replacement of the first out of four conserved amino acid residues thought to be involved in the coordinate binding of mg2+, abolishes the dna binding of the protein in vitro. in view of the resulting lack-of-function mutant phenotype, it appears likely that metal binding by the affected region of the fkh domain is crucial for proper folding of the dna-binding structure.

the ard gene encodes a beta-subunit of drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptors specifically expressed in a subset of neurons. to identify the cis-regulatory region responsible for this cell-specific expression, various 5' fragments of the ard gene were fused to a lacz reporter gene and introduced into the drosophila genome. a dna fragment spanning approximately 760 bp upstream and approximately 140 bp downstream of a cluster of putative transcription start sites produced a pattern of beta-galactosidase activity that resembles the distribution of ard transcripts. both in embryos and adults the levels of lacz rna were similar to those of endogenous ard transcripts, suggesting that the 900 bp fragment harbors all essential elements for proper expression of the ard gene.

neuropeptide function in the peripheral and central nervous systems has been described in mammals as well as in insects. we previously reported the cloning of the neuropeptide receptor nkd, a drosophila melanogaster homologue of the mammalian tachykinin receptors. this receptor is expressed during drosophila embryonic development and in the adult fly. use of the nkd promoter region to drive beta-galactosidase expression in transgenic flies reveals a bipartite promoter organisation: the distal region controls nkd expression in neurosecretory cells of the central nervous system during late embryogenesis, whereas the proximal region is responsible for transient expression in peripheral nervous system during late embryogenesis, whereas the proximal region is responsible for transient expression in peripheral nervous system precursor cells early in development. this early nkd expression, first restricted to the sensory organ precursor cell, an atonal positive cell, is abolished in the ato1 mutant. in addition, we show that the proneural protein atonal, in association with daughterless, transactivates the nkd promoter in schneider s2 cells via the proximal e box nkde2. furthermore, heterodimers of atonal and daughterless interact with this e box in gel shift assay.

along the anterior-posterior axis of animal embryos, the choice of cell fates, and the organization of morphogenesis, is regulated by transcription factors encoded by clustered homeotic or 'hox' genes. hox genes function in both epidermis and internal tissues by regulating the transcription of target genes in a position- and tissue-specific manner. hox proteins can have distinct targets in different tissues; the mechanisms underlying tissue and homeotic protein specificity are unknown. light may be shed by studying the organization of target gene enhancers. in flies, one of the target genes is teashirt (tsh), which encodes a zinc finger protein. tsh itself is a homeotic gene that controls trunk versus head development. we identified a tsh gene enhancer that is differentially activated by hox proteins in epidermis and mesoderm. sites where antennapedia (antp) and ultrabithorax (ubx) proteins bind in vitro were mapped within evolutionarily conserved sequences. although antp and ubx bind to identical sites in vitro, antp activates the tsh enhancer only in epidermis while ubx activates the tsh enhancer in both epidermis and in somatic mesoderm. we show that the dna elements driving tissue-specific transcriptional activation by antp and ubx are separable. next to the homeotic protein-binding sites are extensive conserved sequences likely to control tissue activation by different homeodomain proteins. we propose that local interactions between homeotic proteins and other factors effect activation of targets in proper cell types.

the gap gene hunchback (hb) is required for the formation and segmentation of two regions of the drosophila embryo, a broad anterior domain and a narrow posterior domain. accumulation of hb transcript in the posterior of the embryo occurs in two phases, an initial cap covering the terminal 15% of the embryo followed by a stripe at the anterior edge of this region. by in situ hybridization with transcript-specific probes, we show that the cap is composed only of mrna from the distal transcription initiation site (p1), while the later posterior stripe is composed of mrna from both the distal and proximal (p2) transcription initiation sites. using a series of genomic rescue constructs and promoter-lacz fusion genes, we define a 1.4 kb fragment of the hb upstream region that is both necessary and sufficient for posterior expression. sequences within this fragment mediate regulation by the terminal gap genes tailless (tll) and a huckebein, which direct the formation of the posterior hb stripe. we show that the tll protein binds in vitro to specific sites within the 1.4 kb posterior enhancer region, providing the first direct evidence for activation of gene expression by tll. we propose a model in which the anterior border of the posterior hb stripe is determined by tll concentration in a manner analogous to the activation of anterior hb expression by bicoid.

--------------------

somatic sex determination in drosophila depends on the expression of sex-lethal (sxl), whose level is determined by the relative number of x chromosomes and sets of autosomes (x:a ratio). the first step in regulation of sxl expression is transcriptional control from its early promoter and several genes encoding transcription factors of the helix-loop-helix (hlh) family such as daughterless (da), sisterless-b (sis-b), deadpan (dpn) and extramacrochaetae (emc) have been implicated. by the use of transfection assays and in vitro binding experiments, here we show that da/sis-b heterodimers bind several sites on the sxl early promoter with different affinities and consequently tune the level of active transcription from this promoter. interestingly, our data indicate that repression by the dpn product of da/sis-b dependent activation results from specific binding of dpn protein to a unique site within the promoter. this contrasts with the mode of emc repression, which inhibits the formation of the da/sis-b heterodimers. these results reveal the molecular mechanisms by which sxl gene transcription is positively or negatively regulated to control somatic sex determination.

deformed (dfd) is a drosophila homeotic selector gene required for normal development of maxillary segment morphology in the larval and adult head. consistent with this function, dfd transcripts are restricted to epidermal, mesodermal and neural cells in the embryonic mandibular and maxillary primordia. previous studies have identified a far upstream element in dfd sequences which functions as an epidermal-specific autoregulatory enhancer. in a search through 35 kb of dfd sequences for additional transcriptional control elements, we have identified a 3.2 kb dna fragment containing an enhancer that mimics the expression of dfd in the subesophageal ganglion of the embryonic central nervous system. this neural autoregulatory enhancer (nae) maps in the large dfd intron just upstream of the homeobox exon and requires dfd protein function for its full activity. a 608 bp nae subfragment retains regulatory function that is principally localized in the subesophageal ganglion. this small region of the drosophila melanogaster genome contains numerous blocks of sequence conservation with a comparable region from the dfd locus of d.hydei. a pair of conserved blocks of nae sequence match a dfd protein binding site in the epidermal autoregulatory element, while another conserved sequence motif is repeated multiple times within the 608 bp subelement.

"the notch protein (n) acts as a transmembrane receptor for intercellular signals controlling cell fate choices in vertebrates and invertebrates. the signal of n activation may be transduced directly from the cell surface into the nucleus by an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, suppressor of hairless [su(h)], by its regulated nuclear import. su(h) is shown here to play a direct role in the immediate response of the genome to n signaling in drosophila. first, su(h) mutant embryos derived from mutant germ-line clones exhibited a ""neurogenic"" phenotype of neural hypertrophy similar to the n phenotype. second, the lack of n lateral signaling in these su(h) mutant embryos was associated with a failure to express the m5 and m8 genes from the enhancer of split complex [e(spl)-c]. finally, the su(h) protein bound to the regulatory sequences of the e(spl)-c m5 and m8 genes, and these binding sites were required for the activation of the m5 and m8 promoters in the ventral neuroectoderm. the expression of the e(spl)-c m8 gene was found to be similarly regulated by su(h) during wing imaginal disc development. thus, the transcriptional activation of these e(spl)-c genes by su(h) appears to be a direct and relatively general response to the activation of n. however, we also present evidence indicating that n signals in an su(h)-independent manner during mesectoderm formation."

--------------------

we have investigated the functional relationships among three loci that are required for multiple alternative cell fate decisions during adult peripheral neurogenesis in drosophila: notch (n), which encodes a transmembrane receptor protein, suppressor of hairless [su(h)], which encodes a dna-binding transcription factor, and the enhancer of split gene complex [e(spl)-c], which includes seven transcription units that encode basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) repressor proteins. we describe several lines of evidence establishing that su(h) directly activates transcription of e(spl)-c genes in response to n receptor activity. expression of an activated form of the n receptor leads to elevated and ectopic e(spl)-c transcript accumulation and promoter activity in imaginal discs. we show that the proximal upstream regions of three e(spl)-c genes contain multiple specific binding sites for su(h). the integrity of these sites, as well as su(h) gene activity, are required not only for normal levels of expression of e(spl)-c genes in imaginal disc proneural clusters, but also for their transcriptional response to hyperactivity of the n receptor. our results establish su(h) as a direct regulatory link between n receptor activity and the expression of e(spl)-c genes, extending the known linear structure of the n cell-cell signaling pathway.

the enhancer of split gene complex (e(spl)-c) of drosophila comprises seven genes encoding bhlh proteins, which are required by neuroectodermal cells for epidermal development. using promoter and gene fusions with the lacz gene, we determined the location of cis-acting sequences necessary for normal expression of two of the genes of the e(spl)-c, e(spl) and hlh-m5. about 0.46 kb of e(spl) and 1.9 kb of hlh-m5 upstream sequences are necessary to reproduce the normal transcription pattern of these genes. the gene products of achaete, scute and lethal of scute, together with that of ventral nervous system condensation defective, act synergistically to specify the neuroectodermal e(spl) and hlh-m5 expression domains. negative cross- and autoregulatory interactions of the e(spl)-c on e(spl) contribute, directly or indirectly, to this regulation. interactions involve dna binding, since mutagenesis of binding sites for bhlh proteins in the e(spl) promoter abolishes neuroectodermal expression and activates ectopic expression in neuroblasts. a model for activation and repression of e(spl) in the neuroectoderm and neuroblasts, respectively, is proposed.

the cubitus interruptus (ci) gene of drosophila is expressed in all anterior compartment cells in both embryos and imaginal disks where it encodes a putative zinc-finger protein related to the vertebrate gli and c. elegans tra-1 proteins. using ci/lacz fusions, we located regulatory sequences responsible for the normal pattern of ci expression, and obtained evidence that separate elements regulate its expression in embryos and imaginal disks. mutants that delete a portion of this regulatory region express ci ectopically in the posterior compartments of their wing imaginal disks and have wings with malformed posterior compartments. similar deletions of ci/lacz fusion constructs also result in ectopic posterior compartment expression. evidence that the engrailed protein normally represses ci in posterior compartments includes the expansion of ci expression into posterior compartment cells that lack engrailed function, diminution of ci expression upon overexpression of engrailed protein in anterior compartment cells, and the ability of engrailed protein to bind to the ci regulatory region in vivo and in vitro. we suggest that engrailed protein directly represses ci expression in posterior compartment cells.

in drosophila, engrailed is a nuclear regulatory protein with essential roles in embryonic segmentation and in normal development of posterior compartments. one of its regulatory targets appears to be polyhomeotic (ph), a polycomb group gene. we observed, by immunostaining, that engrailed protein binds to the site of the polyhomeotic locus in region 2d of polytene chromosomes. the same analysis carried out on a transgenic line containing one copy of a p(ph-lacz) construct shows an additional engrailed-binding site at the location of the insert. in vivo, polyhomeotic depends on engrailed function in germ-band-elongated embryos, when engrailed and polyhomeotic genes are expressed in similar patterns. by in vitro immunoprecipitations and gel shift assays, we identified two classes of high affinity engrailed-binding sites upstream of each of the two polyhomeotic transcription units. dna fragments containing these sites were also immunoprecipitated from embryonic uv crosslinked chromatin in presence of anti-engrailed antibody. these results suggest that polyhomeotic activation in germ-band-elongated embryos could be mediated by engrailed-binding to these sites.

the drosophila apterous gene encodes a lim homeodomain protein expressed embryonically in a small subset of differentiating neurons. to establish the identity of these neurons and to study the role of apterous in their development, we made apterous promoter fusions to an axon-targeted reporter gene. we found that all apterous-expressing neurons are interneurons that choose a single pathway within the developing central nervous system. in apterous mutants, these neurons choose incorrect pathways and fail to fasciculate with one another. our results indicate that apterous functions to control neuronal pathway selection and suggest that other vertebrate and invertebrate members of the lim homeodomain class of proteins may serve similar functions.

we present a genetic and molecular analysis of two hairy (h) pair-rule stripes in order to determine how gradients of gap proteins position adjacent stripes of gene expression in the posterior of drosophila embryos. we have delimited regulatory sequences critical for the expression of h stripes 5 and 6 to 302 bp and 526 bp fragments, respectively, and assayed the expression of stripe-specific reporter constructs in several gap mutant backgrounds. we demonstrate that posterior stripe boundaries are established by gap protein repressors unique to each stripe: h stripe 5 is repressed by the giant (gt) protein on its posterior border and h stripe 6 is repressed by the hunchback (hb) protein on its posterior border. interestingly, krüppel (kr) limits the anterior expression limits of both stripes and is the only gap gene to do so, indicating that stripes 5 and 6 may be coordinately positioned by the kr repressor. in contrast to these very similar cases of spatial repression, stripes 5 and 6 appear to be activated by different mechanisms. stripe 6 is critically dependent upon knirps (kni) for activation, while stripe 5 likely requires a combination of activating proteins (gap and non-gap). to begin a mechanistic understanding of stripe formation, we locate binding sites for the kr protein in both stripe enhancers. the stripe 6 enhancer contains higher affinity kr-binding sites than the stripe 5 enhancer, which may allow for the two stripes to be repressed at different kr protein concentration thresholds. we also demonstrate that the kni activator binds to the stripe 6 enhancer and present evidence for a competitive mechanism of kr repression of stripe 6.

the process of body prepatterning during drosophila blastoderm formation relies on the localized activities of zygotic segmentation genes, which are controlled by asymmetrically distributed maternal determinants. the anterior determinant bicoid, a homeodomain transcription factor, forms an anterior-to-posterior concentration gradient. it interacts with the maternal transcription factor hunchback to activate the anterior zygotic patterning genes, including the central gap gene krüppel (kr). in contrast, the posterior maternal system does not provide such a decisive transcription factor, but rather prevents the repressor hunchback from acting in the posterior half so that the gap genes giant (gt) and knirps (kni) are activated by an as yet unknown transcription factor. here we show that caudal, a conserved homeodomain protein that forms a posterior-to-anterior concentration gradient, and the anterior determinant bicoid cooperate to form a partly redundant activator system in the posterior region of the embryo.

a new member of the rel family of transcription factors, the dorsal-related immunity factor, dif, was recently cloned and suggested to be involved in regulating the immune response in drosophila. despite its classification as a rel family member, the dif cdna-encoded product has not been proven previously to be a transcription factor. we now present evidence that the dif gene product trans-activates the drosophila cecropin a1 gene in co-transfection assays. the transactivation requires a 40 bp upstream element including an insect kappa b-like motif. a dimer of the kappa b-like motif 5'-ggggattttt inserted into a minimal promoter conferred high levels of reporter gene expression by dif, while a multimer of several mutated versions of this motif was not activated, demonstrating the sequence specificity of dif. full trans-activation by dif requires the c-terminal part of the protein. the morphogen dorsal (dl) can also activate the cecropin a1 promoter, but to a lesser extent and in a less sequence-specific manner than dif. simultaneous overexpression of dif and dl in co-transfection assays revealed that dl possesses a dominant negative effect on dif transactivation. this study establishes that dif is a sequence-specific transcription factor and is probably a key activator of the immune response in drosophila.

in drosophila, the homeotic gene proboscipedia (pb) is required for the formation of the adult mouthparts. to determine the functional significance of putative pb regulatory dna, we have performed an in vivo analysis of sequences upstream of and within pb using a series of minigenes. additionally, we have initiated a dissection of pb's promoter and enhancer elements using lacz reporter gene constructs. our results establish that a conserved region located in the second intron is essential for proper formation of the adult mouthparts. a 0.5 kb fragment from this region was shown to direct lacz expression in a pb pattern in both embryos and third instar labial discs when combined with a 600 bp pb basal promoter sequence. a 32 bp element contained within the 0.5 kb region functions as a labial disc enhancers for pb. surprisingly, the conserved second intron pb enhancers do not function properly with a heterologous hsp70 promoter, suggesting that promoter-specific interactions occur at the pb locus. we also found redundant and cryptic enhancers in the large introns of pb that are not required for pb function. finally, we demonstrate that the pb transcription unit does not require sequences upstream of -98 bp to provide pb function in the labial discs. rather, pb's upstream dna appears to contain negative regulatory dna required for silencing pb accumulation in inappropriate domains of third instar imaginal discs. thus, we have defined many of pb's cis-controlling sequences to an experimentally manageable size, thereby making this an attractive system for the discovery of transacting proteins and, consequently, for elucidating the mechanisms of homeotic gene regulation.

the pattern of bristles and other sensory organs on the adult cuticle of drosophila is prefigured in the imaginal discs by the pattern of expression of the proneural achaete (ac) and scute (sc) genes, two members of the ac-sc complex (as-c). these genes are simultaneously expressed by groups of cells (the proneural clusters) located at constant positions in discs. their products (transcription factors of the basic-helix-loop-helix family) allow cells to become sensory organ mother cells (smcs), a fate normally realized by only one or a few cells per cluster. here we show that the highly complex pattern of proneural clusters is constructed piecemeal, by the action on ac and sc of site-specific, enhancer-like elements distributed along most of the as-c (approximately 90 kb). fragments of as-c dna containing these enhancers drive reporter lacz genes in only one or a few proneural clusters. this expression is independent of the ac and sc endogenous genes, indicating that the enhancers respond to local combinations of factors (prepattern). we show further that the cross-activation between ac and sc, discovered by means of transgenes containing either ac or sc promoter fragments linked to lacz and thought to explain the almost identical patterns of ac and sc expression, does not occur detectably between the endogenous ac and sc genes in most proneural clusters. our data indicate that coexpression is accomplished by activation of both ac and sc by the same set of position-specific enhancers.

the d. melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) gene is transcribed from two tandem promoters that are differentially utilized at various stages during development. to determine the mechanism of promoter selectivity, we have analyzed the activity of the adh promoters both in vitro and in transfected cells. we found that selective promoter utilization is controlled by distinct initiator elements. reconstitution of adh transcription with purified components requires a specific tbp-taf complex that, in concert with tfiia, directs differential adh promoter transcription. fractionation of this tbp-taf complex reveals that tafii150 is required for discrimination between the proximal and distal promoters. we propose a mechanism for regulating differential promoter utilization during drosophila development that involves the recognition of specific initiator elements by tafs in the tfiid complex.

the genes janus (jan) a and b, and serendipity (sry) beta and delta are two pairs of duplicated genes that are adjacent to each other on the third chromosome of drosophila melanogaster. the jan a and sry beta genes are expressed throughout development in both males and females. they are transcribed in opposite orientations from start sites separated by only 173 bp of dna. we report here the complete sequence of the jan a and b genes in drosophila pseudoobscura, a species distantly related to d. melanogaster in which the overall organization of the sry beta, jan a and jan b genes is identical to that in d. melanogaster. sequence comparison of the jan a-sry beta intergenic region and 5'-transcribed domain of each gene between d. melanogaster and d. pseudoobscura reveals short stretches of conserved sequences that may correspond to cis-acting regulator elements. in order to test the possibility that some cis-acting regulatory sequences are shared by the two genes, we carried out a deletion analysis of the jan a/sry beta intergenic region in d. melanogaster using transgenic lacz fusion genes. our results show that sry beta cis-acting sequences are located in the (-117; +137) 5'-region of the gene and that jan a cis-regulatory sequences are included in the (-56; +151) 5'-domain of this gene. together these data indicate that in spite of the physical proximity of the jan a and sry beta genes, their transcription is regulated by separate cis-acting sequences.

we characterize a cluster of three genes, named mst57da, mst57db and mst57dc, according to their localization at polytene band 57d and their selective expression in drosophila melanogaster males. within a 4 kb segment of genomic dna these genes code for poly(a)+ rnas of about 750 nt, 650 nt and 850 nt length that are restricted to the male accessory glands. they all contain relatively long 5' and 3' untranslated regions compared to the size of their open reading frames. the 5' untranslated regions are characterized by several short open reading frames. in addition, the genes mst57da and mst57db share a 14 nucleotides long conserved sequence block in front of the putative translated regions. we propose that these common features are structural elements important for translational control of these genes. the predicted sequences of the small proteins of 55, 40 and 42 amino acids suggest that two of them (mst57da and mst57db) are secretory proteins and therefore components of the paragonial secretions. in p-element mediated germ line transformations of mst57db/lacz fusion genes, a short gene fragment of -187/+395 is still specifically expressed in the paragonia. in addition, regions involved in negative and positive control of transcription have been identified. development of a supernumerary paragonial gland is frequently observed in transgenic, intersexual genotypes indicating that in intersexes cells derived from the female genital disc can develop male genital structures.

the drosophila homeotic gene sex combs reduced (scr) controls the segmental identity of the labial and prothoracic segments in the embryo and adult. it encodes a sequence-specific transcription factor that controls, in concert with other gene products, differentiative pathways of tissues in which scr is expressed. during embryogenesis, scr accumulation is observed in a discrete spatiotemporal pattern that includes the labial and prothoracic ectoderm, the subesophageal ganglion of the ventral nerve cord and the visceral mesoderm of the anterior and posterior midgut. previous analyses have demonstrated that breakpoint mutations located in a 75-kb interval, including the scr transcription unit and 50 kb of upstream dna, cause scr misexpression during development, presumably because these mutations remove scr cis-regulatory sequences from the proximity of the scr promoter. to gain a better understanding of the regulatory interactions necessary for the control of scr transcription during embryogenesis, we have begun a molecular analysis of the scr regulatory interval. dna fragments from this 75-kb region were subcloned into p-element vectors containing either an scr-lacz or hsp70-lacz fusion gene, and patterns of reporter gene expression were assayed in transgenic embryos. several fragments appear to contain scr regulatory sequences, as they direct reporter gene expression in patterns similar to those normally observed for scr, whereas other dna fragments direct scr reporter gene expression in developmentally interesting but non-scr-like patterns during embryogenesis. scr expression in some tissues appears to be controlled by multiple regulatory elements that are separated, in some cases, by more than 20 kb of intervening dna. interestingly, regulatory sequences that direct reporter gene expression in an scr-like pattern in the anterior and posterior midgut are imbedded in the regulatory region of the segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz), which is normally located between 10 and 20 kb 5' of the scr transcription start site. this analysis provides an entry point for the study of how scr transcription is regulated at the molecular level.

the serendipity alpha (sry alpha) cellularisation gene is only transcribed at the blastoderm stage, when this morphogenetic event takes place. we show that a 95 bp sry alpha upstream region is sufficient for blastoderm-specific expression of a lacz reporter gene. this region encompasses four nucleotide motifs (i-iv, 5' to 3') conserved at similar relative positions in several drosophila species. removal of motif i leads to ectopic expression of lacz in precursor cells of the pns. deletion of motif iv decreases the level of lacz transcripts and modifies their banded pattern of accumulation late in cycle 14, whereas deletion of motifs ii and iii abolishes the sry alpha promoter activity. motif iii includes a consensus recognition site for b-hlh proteins. a point mutation in this e-box both severely reduces lacz expression at blastoderm and prevents its ectopic expression in the pns upon deleting motif i. these two effects depend upon da+ activity, suggesting that daughterless may positively control sry alpha transcription.

within the 2.2 kb region between hsp23 and gene 1 of the small heat shock gene locus 67b1 of drosophila melanogaster, an approximately 1 kb perturbation of the chromatin architecture has previously been observed to occur in response to the steroid hormone ecdysone. transient expression assays in hormonally-responsive drosophila tissue culture cells utilizing hsp70-lacz chimeric reporter constructs revealed the presence of ecdysone-dependent regulatory sequences in this hsp23-gene 1 intergenic region. the analysis delimited five functional segments: three core regions which were completely encompassed within the region of chromatin perturbation, and two gene-proximal regions which appear to be functionally equivalent under some circumstances. none of the delineated regions was capable of stimulating expression independently, while sub-maximal expression was obtained when combinations of two or three regions were monitored. this requirement for multiple dna segments to drive maximal transcription suggested that cooperative interactions between the regions were essential for full hormonal responsiveness. unexpectedly, no binding of the ecdysone receptor was detectable within any of the delineated regions, implying the involvement of multiple non-receptor factors in the observed hormonal responsiveness. the ecdysone-dependent activation of reporter constructs driven by these sequences showed a significant time lag and was coupled with a marked sensitivity to low concentrations of cycloheximide. the data obtained strongly suggest that the cis-acting elements delimited within the hsp23-gene 1 intergenic region respond to ecdysone in a secondary manner, presumably by requiring interaction with the product(s) of primary ecdysone-responsive genes.

the cut locus encodes a homeobox protein that is localized in the nuclei of a variety of tissues and is required for proper morphogenesis of those tissues. cut protein is required in embryonic and adult external sensory organs, where its absence results in conversion of the organs to chordotonal organs. expression of cut also occurs in the malpighian tubules, spiracles, central nervous system, and a number of other tissues. gypsy transposon insertions upstream of the cut promoter block expression in subsets of these tissues. the effect of the gypsy insertions is polar, with those farthest from the promoter affecting the fewest tissues. the hypothesis that gypsy insertions block a series of tissue-specific enhancer elements that are distributed over a region of 80 kb upstream of the promoter predicts the location of the enhancers for cut expression in each of the tissues in which it is active in embryos. dna fragments from this region drive expression of a reporter gene in each of the embryonic tissues in which endogenous cut gene is expressed. each tissue has its own enhancer, and none of the enhancers require the activity of the endogenous cut gene to function.

the drosophila melanogaster decapentaplegic (dpp) gene encodes a transforming growth factor beta-related cell signaling molecule that plays a critical role in dorsal/ventral pattern formation. the dpp expression pattern in the drosophila embryo is dynamic, consisting of three phases. phase i, in which dpp is expressed in a broad dorsal domain, depends on elements in the dpp second intron that interact with the dorsal transcription factor to repress transcription ventrally. in contrast, phases ii and iii, in which dpp is expressed first in broad longitudinal stripes (phase ii) and subsequently in narrow longitudinal stripes (phase iii), depend on multiple independent elements in the dpp 5'-flanking region. several aspects of the normal dpp expression pattern appear to depend on the unique properties of the dpp core promoter. for example, this core promoter (extending from -22 to +6) is able to direct a phase ii expression pattern in the absence of additional upstream or downstream regulatory elements. in addition, a ventral-specific enhancer in the dpp 5'-flanking region that binds the dorsal factor activates the heterologous hsp70 core promoter but not the dpp core promoter. thus, the dpp core promoter region may contribute to spatially regulated transcription both by interacting directly with spatially restricted activators and by modifying the activity of proteins bound to enhancer elements.

we have identified a novel homeodomain gene, buttonless (btn), that is specifically expressed in 20 cells of a single type during drosophila embryonic development. these cells, the dorsal median (dm) cells, are arranged as a single pair within each segment along the dorsal midline of the cns. distinctive features of the dm cells include a large cell body and a long thick process extending laterally to the muscle attachment site. in the absence of btn gene function the initial commitment to the dm cell fate is made but differentiation fails to occur and the dm cells are lost. the btn mutation thus specifically eliminates the dm cells, and this genetic ablation in turn reveals a requirement for dm cells as cellular cues for axonal guidance during transverse nerve outgrowth and bifurcation of the median nerve.

the clustered homeotic genes encode transcription factors that regulate pattern formation in all animals, conferring cell fates by coordinating the activities of downstream 'target' genes. in the drosophila midgut, the ultrabithorax (ubx) protein activates and the abdominala (abd-a) protein represses transcription of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene, which encodes a secreted signalling protein of the tgf beta class. we have identified an 813 bp dpp enhancer which is capable of driving expression of a lacz gene in a correct pattern in the embryonic midgut. the enhancer is activated ectopically in the visceral mesoderm by ubiquitous expression of ubx or antennapedia but not by sex combs reduced protein. ectopic expression of abd-a represses the enhancer. deletion analysis reveals regions required for repression and activation. a 419 bp subfragment of the 813 bp fragment also drives reporter gene expression in an appropriate pattern, albeit more weakly. evolutionary sequence conservation suggests other factors work with homeotic proteins to regulate dpp. a candidate cofactor, the extradenticle protein, binds to the dpp enhancer in close proximity to homeotic protein binding sites. mutation of either this site or another conserved motif compromises enhancer function. a 45 bp fragment of dna from within the enhancer correctly responds to both ubx and abd-a in a largely tissue-specific manner, thus representing the smallest in vivo homeotic response element (homre) identified to date.

members of the myocyte enhancer binding factor-2 (mef2) family of mads (mcm1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor) box transcription factors are expressed in the skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle lineages of vertebrate and drosophila embryos. these factors bind an adenine-thymidine-rich dna sequence associated with muscle-specific genes. the function of mef2 was determined by generating a loss-of-function of the single mef2 gene in drosophila (d-mef2). in loss-of-function embryos, somatic, cardiac, and visceral muscle cells did not differentiate, but myoblasts were normally specified and positioned. these results demonstrate that different muscle cell types share a common myogenic differentiation program controlled by mef2.

the pourquoi-pas? (pqp) gene of drosophila melanogaster encodes a zinc finger protein present in the oocyte nucleus, the nurse cells and, at a lower level, in the follicle cells. null mutations of the pqp gene lead to female sterility. we have undertaken a functional dissection of the pqp promoter by following the expression of the lacz reporter gene in the ovaries of transgenic flies. pqp sequences, necessary for expression of the lacz gene in a pattern similar to that of the endogenous pqp gene, are located between positions -210 and +30, relative to the transcription start site. these sequences, subdivided in follicle cell- and germ line-specific regions, appear to function in a direction-independent and distance-sensitive manner. the -210/-40 region, sharing stretches of sequence similarity with 5' sequences of follicle cell-specific genes, promotes lacz expression only in the follicle cells. the -80/+30 region is germ line-specific. the promoter limits, deduced from the deletion experiments presented here, are in accordance with the molecular analysis of pqp mutants.

the dhod gene encodes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (dhodehase), which catalyzes the fourth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. in addition to the common 1.5 kb dhod rna expressed by embryos and females, adult males produce a group of slightly longer rnas. evidence is presented that the latter rnas arise through transcription initiation at sites upstream from that of the common rna and expression of these male-specific rnas is limited to spermatogenesis. in situ hybridization analysis shows that these rnas accumulate during spermatocyte growth and persist through meiosis and early spermatid differentiation. in contrast, dhodehase activity is virtually absent in spermatocytes, meiotic cells, and in early spermatid cysts, then it becomes highly abundant in elongated spermatid cysts and disappears in late spermatogenesis. thus, testis-limited expression of dhod conforms to a model proposed for other genes that function during spermiogenesis: transcription in spermatocytes, storage of translationally inactive rna through meiosis, translation of the rna during spermiogenesis. very similar expression of a testis promoter-lacz fusion transgene indicates that sequences required for the spermatogenesis transcription and translation patterns are confined to the 5' end of the dhod gene. deletion analysis of that 5' region delimits all sequences necessary for spermatid expression of the transgene to a 89 bp fragment. these results are discussed in the contexts of known mechanisms of gene regulation during spermatogenesis and potential roles of dhodehase during spermiogenesis.

to elucidate the mechanisms by which homeotic selector (hom) genes specify the unique features of drosophila segments, we have analyzed the regulation of decapentaplegic (dpp), a transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta superfamily member, and have found that the ultrabithorax (ubx) hom protein directly activates dpp expression in parasegment 7 (ps7) of the embryonic visceral mesoderm. other factors are also required, including one that appears to act through homeodomain protein binding sites and may be encoded by extradenticle (exd). the exd protein binds in a highly co-operative manner to regulatory sequences mediating ps7-specific dpp expression, consistent with a genetic requirement for exd function in normal visceral mesoderm expression of dpp. a second mechanism contributing to ps7 expression of dpp appears not to require ubx protein directly, and involves a general visceral mesoderm enhancer coupled to a spatially specific repression element. thus, even in an apparently simple case where visceral mesoderm expression of the dpp target gene mirrors that of the ubx hom protein, full activation by ubx protein requires at least one additional factor. in addition, a distinct regulatory mode not directly involving ubx protein also appears to contribute to ps7-specific expression.

the paired (prd) gene of drosophila belongs to the pair-rule class of segmentation genes involved in establishing the metameric organization of the drosophila body plan. the complex expression pattern of prd has previously been shown to depend upon a number of segmentation genes, including gap and pair-rule genes. in an attempt to characterize and analyze the regulatory regions necessary and sufficient for prd expression, we have identified an 18-kb genomic fragment, consisting of the transcribed portion of prd and 10 kb of 5'- and 5 kb of 3'-flanking region, that is able to rescue prd mutant embryos to full viability. analysis of a series of prd-lacz fusion constructs containing progressively reduced lengths of prd 5'-flanking sequences delimits different cis-regulatory regions. the entire 5'-flanking region directs fusion gene expression in a pattern similar, but not identical, to the endogenous prd protein pattern. this 10-kb fragment contains both activator and repressor regions that mediate the establishment of the seven-stripe prd pattern, as well as the splitting into anterior and posterior stripes for the 14-stripe expression phase. the prd intron in combination with a minimal upstream region (0.15 kb) is able to direct low levels of prd-lacz fusion gene expression in stripes. information for expression of the anterior dorsal spot and of the early seven-stripe pattern is located downstream of the prd coding region. we propose that regulation of prd by pair-rule and gap gene products is mediated by upstream and downstream cis-regulatory elements. regulation during separate but overlapping phases of expression by separable regulatory regions might be a general characteristic of segmentation genes.

the drosophila homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx) encodes transcriptional regulatory proteins (ubx) that specify thoracic and abdominal segmental identities. ubx autoregulation was examined by manipulating ubx levels, both genetically and with an inducible transgene, and monitoring the effect of these manipulations on the expression of ubx and ubx-lacz reporter genes. positive autoregulation by ubx is restricted to the visceral mesoderm, while in other tissues ubx negatively autoregulates. in some cases, negative autoregulation stabilizes ubx levels, while in others it modulates the spatial and temporal patterns of ubx expression. this modulation of ubx expression may enable ubx to specify distinct identities in different segments. the upstream control region of ubx contains multiple autoregulatory elements for both positive and negative autoregulation.

the expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under control of the 1152-base pair 5'-flanking region (-1107 to +45 nucleotide positions with respect to the major transcription initiation site) of the drosophila dna polymerase alpha gene was repressed by cotransfection into drosophila kc cells with a zerknüllt (zen)-expressing plasmid as previously observed with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) gene promoter. the expression of the zen resulted in reduction of the abundance of mrna for the transfected chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and also mrnas for both dna polymerase alpha and pcna. results obtained using various deletion derivatives of the promoter region and chemically synthesized oligonucleotides of the dna replication-related element (dre), a positive cis-acting element found in both dna polymerase alpha and pcna genes, revealed that the dre sequences are responsible to repression by zen protein. the nuclear extract of kc cells transfected by the zen-expressing plasmid contained lesser amounts of the dre-binding factor (dref) than that of untransfected or mutant zen-transfected cells. these results suggest that the zen protein represses expression of dna replication-related genes by reducing dref, although the detailed mechanism of the repression remains to be elucidated.

drosophila homeotic genes encode transcription factors thought to control segmental identity by regulating expression of largely unknown target genes. the formation of the second midgut constriction requires the ultrabithorax (ubx) and abdominal-a (abd-a) homeotic genes and decapentaplegic (dpp), a gene encoding a member of the tgf beta family of proteins. we identified a 674 bp enhancer of dpp controlling its expression in the second constriction domain of the visceral mesoderm (parasegment 7). normal enhancer function requires positive regulation by ubx and negative regulation by abd-a. this enhancer contains ubx- and abd-a-binding sites defined in vitro. by generating complementary alterations of the binding sites and the binding specificity of ubx, we show that ubx directly regulates dpp expression. these regulatory interactions are relevant to normal development, because a transgene made with this enhancer driving a dpp transcription unit rescues the second midgut constriction and larval lethality phenotypes of dpps mutations.

how each of the homeotic selector proteins can regulate distinct sets of dna target elements in embryos is not understood. here we describe a detailed functional dissection of a small element that is specifically regulated by the deformed homeotic protein. this 120 bp element (module e) is part of a larger 2.7 kb autoregulatory enhancer that maintains deformed (dfd) transcription in the epidermis of the maxillary and mandibular segments of drosophila embryos. in vitro binding assays show that module e contains only one dfd protein binding site. mutations in the dfd binding site that increase or decrease its in vitro affinity for dfd protein generate parallel changes in the regulatory activity of module e in transgenic embryos, strong evidence that the in vitro-defined binding site is a direct target of dfd protein in embryos. however, a monomer or multimer of the dfd binding region alone is not sufficient to supply dfd-dependent, segment-specific reporter gene expression. an analysis of a systematic series of clustered point mutations in module e revealed that an additional region containing an imperfect inverted repeat sequence is also required for the function of this homeotic protein response element. the dfd binding site and the putative cofactor binding site(s) in the region of the inverted repeat are both necessary and in combination sufficient for the function of module e.

mutations in the drosophila gene extradenticle (exd), a homologue of the human proto-oncogene pbx1, cause homeotic transformations by altering the morphological consequences of homeotic selector gene activity. exd has been proposed to act by contributing to the specificity of selector homeodomain proteins for their downstream targets. here we show that exd is indeed required for the appropriate regulation of at least some of these target genes. expression patterns of wingless, teashirt and decapentaplegic (dpp) are altered in the embryonic midgut of embryos lacking exd, while the expression of their respective regulators (abd-a, antp and ubx) remains normal. co-regulation of dpp by exd and ubx was investigated in greater detail by examining the expression of reporter constructs in exd embryos. these experiments not only define dpp regulatory regions responsive to exd, but also distinguish two functions of exd in the regulation of dpp. exd acts with ubx to activate dpp expression in parasegment 7 (ps7), via a minimal visceral mesoderm enhancer, and exd represses dpp expression anterior to ps7. we show that even when ubx is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in exd embryos, ubx is incapable of activating dpp enhancer expression. thus, exd is an indispensable component in target gene regulation by the homeotic selector proteins.

in drosophila, the homeotic genes encode transcription factors which specify segmental identities during embryogenesis by directly regulating subordinate target genes. a chromatin immunopurification approach has been used to identify targets of the homeotic gene ultrabithorax (ubx). we report here the characterisation of a candidate target gene which is positively regulated by the homeotic genes ubx and abdominal-a in both the epidermis and the midgut visceral mesoderm and encodes a novel transmembrane protein. by mapping the cis-regulatory regions of this gene, we have identified elements responsible for mediating homeotic regulation, and show that they contain in vitro ubx binding sites. therefore, we suggest that this is an example of a direct target of regulation by homeotic genes in two germlayers.

the eip28/29 gene of drosophila is an example of a tissue- and stage-specific ecdysone-responsive gene. its diverse patterns of expression during the third larval instar and a synopsis of those patterns in terms of expression groups have been reported previously. here we have studied the expression (in transgenic flies) of reporter genes controlled by eip28/29-derived flanking dna. during the middle and late third instar, most tissues exhibit normal expression patterns when controlled by one of two classes of regulatory sequences. class a sequences include only 657 np of 5' flanking dna from eip28/29. class b sequences include an extended 3' flanking region and a minimal (< or = 93 np) 5' flanking region. the class b sequences include all those elements known to be important for ecdysone induction in cultured cells. they are sufficient to direct the normal premetamorphic induction of eip28/29 in the lymph glands, hemocytes, proventriculus, and malpighian tubules. this is consistent with our suggestion that kc cells are derived from embryonic hematopoietic cells. it is remarkable that the epidermis requires only class a sequences. these are sufficient to up-regulate expression at mid-instar and to down-regulate expression at metamorphosis. it follows that the epidermis uses ecres distinct from those that function in kc cells. it is possible that the upstream ecre, which is nearly silent in kc cells, is active in the epidermis.

in drosophila imaginal discs, the spatially restricted activities of the achaete (ac) and scute (sc) proteins, which are transcriptional activators of the basic-helix-loop-helix class, define proneural clusters (pncs) of potential sensory organ precursor (sop) cells. here, we report the identification of several genes that are direct downstream targets of ac-sc activation, as judged by the following criteria. the genes are expressed in the pncs of the wing imaginal disc in an ac-sc-dependent manner; the proximal promoter regions of all of these genes contain one or two high-affinity ac-sc binding sites, which define the novel consensus gcaggtg(t/g)nnnyy; where tested, these binding sites are required in vivo for pnc expression of promoter-reporter fusion genes. interestingly, these ac-sc target genes, including bearded, enhancer of split m7, enhancer of split m8, and scabrous, are all known or believed to function in the selection of a single sop from each pnc, a process mediated by inhibitory cell-cell interactions. thus, one of the earliest steps in adult peripheral neurogenesis is the direct activation by proneural proteins of genes involved in restricting the expression of the sop cell fate.

the transcription of the drosophila melanogaster fbp1 gene is induced by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and restricted to the late-third-instar fat body tissue. in a previous study we showed that the -68 to -138 region relative to the transcription start site acts as an ecdysone-dependent third-instar fat body-specific enhancer in a transgenic assay. here we report that seven nucleoprotein complexes are formed in vitro on this enhancer when a nuclear extract from late-third-instar fat body is used in a gel shift assay. accurate mapping of the binding sites of the complexes revealed a remarkably symmetrical organization. using specific antibodies, one of the complexes was identified as a heterodimer consisting of the ecdysone receptor (ecr) and ultraspiracle (usp) proteins. the binding site of the heterodimer as defined by mutagenesis and methylation interference experiments bears strong sequence similarity to the canonical hsp27 ecdysone response element, including an imperfect palindromic structure. the two elements diverge at three positions in both half-sites, indicating that the structure of an active ecr/usp binding site allows considerable sequence variations. in vivo footprinting experiments using ligation-mediated pcr and wild-type or ecdysteroid-deficient larvae show that occupancy of the fbp1 ecr/usp binding site and adjacent region is dependent on a high concentration of ecdysteroids. these results provide strong evidence for a direct role of the ecr/usp heterodimer in driving gene expression in response to changes of the ecdysteroid titer during drosophila larval development.

we identify dna regions that are necessary for the ubiquitous expression of the drosophila melanogaster alpha 1-tubulin (alpha 1t) gene. in vitro transcription showed that two upstream regions, tubulin element 1 (te1 [29 bp]) and tubulin element 2 (te2 [68 bp]), and a downstream region activate transcription. germ line transformation demonstrated that these three regions are sufficient to direct the alpha 1t core promoter to begin transcribing at the stage of cellular blastoderm formation and to continue thereafter at high levels in all tissues and developmental stages. remarkably, mutation of any one of these regions results in high sensitivity to chromosomal position effects, producing different but reproducible tissue-specific patterns of expression in each transformed line. none of these regions behaves as an enhancer in a conventional germ line transformation test. these observations show that these three regions, two of which bind the gaga transcription factor, act ubiquitously to insulate from position effects and to activate transcription. the results also provide vectors for ubiquitous expression of gene products and for examining silencer activities.

the pivotal role of twist in mesoderm determination in the drosophila embryo depends upon two processes--the transcriptional activation of twist in the ventrally located mesodermal anlage and the regulation of downstream gene expression by the twist transcription factor. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes, we have compared both the coding and regulatory regions of the twist genes from drosophila melanogaster and drosophila virilis. within the coding region, the basic-helix-loop-helix dna binding and dimerization motif is highly conserved, consistent with the functional importance of this domain. a comparison of the transcriptional regulatory regions reveals a high degree of conservation in the more distal of the two ventral activator regions that have been mapped in the twist 5' flanking region. on the other hand, the more proximal ventral activator region is absent at the corresponding position in the d. virilis twist gene. instead, there is a region in the second intron of the d. virilis gene that resembles the proximal element of the d. melanogaster gene, in that it consists of little more than a series of whole and half binding sites for the dorsal morphogen. in transformation experiments, the intronic d. virilis element directs an expression pattern that is indistinguishable from that directed by the d. melanogaster proximal var. thus, the twi genes from these two species appear to have evolved enhancer elements with very similar structural and functional properties. these findings suggest that apparently redundant spatially regulated enhancer elements may each play essential roles in fine tuning the level and/or pattern of gene expression.

djun is the homolog of the mammalian proto-oncogene jun in d. melanogaster, where it encodes a component of an ap-1-like nuclear dna binding protein, or transcription factor. djun, unlike its vertebrate counterparts, contains an intron in its 5' noncoding region. the expression of djun in cultured schneider line 2 cells is controlled by multiple cis-acting elements in its promoter region and the 5' noncoding region of the transcription unit. a 43-bp 5' upstream promoter region is necessary for the transcription activity of djun. deletion of this fragment decreased transcriptional activity by 67-fold. this region includes a tata box and a sequence similar to the drosophila transcription factor 1 (dtf-1) consensus sequence (gcaacat/gc/c). a large dnase i footprint covering both the dtf-1 binding site and the tata box was detected in this region when incubated with nuclear extract from drosophila embryos, suggesting interactions with related transcription factors. this 43-bp sequence alone, containing the dtf-1 binding site and tata box, however, is not sufficient for transcription activity. an 80-bp sequence including the start of transcription has considerable basal activity. an intragenic region containing an ap-1 site and a cre site modulates or fine tunes activity of the promoter. its activity as an enhancer is reduced when moved upstream in either orientation. an extragenic region containing two ap-1 sites similarly affects promoter activity.

the empty spiracles (ems) homeo box gene is required for the development of the drosophila larval filzkörper, which are structural specializations of the eighth abdominal segment. filzkörper development is also dependent on the function of the homeotic selector gene abdominal-b (abd-b). here, we show that ems is a downstream gene that is transcriptionally regulated by abd-b proteins. this regulation is mediated by an abd-b-dependent ems cis-regulatory element that in early- to mid-stage embryos is activated only in the eighth abdominal segment. genetic epistasis tests suggest that both ems and abd-b are required in combination for the specification of the filzkörper primordia. in a general sense, these results also provide evidence that the hierarchical level immediately downstream of the homeotic genes contains additional homeo domain transcription factors that define subsegmental domain identities.

regulatory sequences or factors involved in the regulation of target genes of drosophila homeodomain proteins are largely unknown. here, we identify sequence elements that are involved in the function of the fushi tarazu (ftz) autoregulatory element ae, a direct in vivo target of the homeodomain protein ftz. a systematic deletion analysis of ae in transgenic embryos defines multiple elements that are redundantly involved in enhancer activity. sequences juxtaposed to ftz binding sites are not strictly required for enhancer function. several sequence motifs are conserved in other developmentally regulated genes of drosophila melanogaster and in the ae homologue of drosophila virilis. the d. virilis ae is functional in d. melanogaster. the sequence motifs identified here are candidate elements contributing to the target specificity of the homeodomain protein ftz.

homeotic genes determine the developmental fates of cells. restriction of their expression along the body axis is of prime importance for normal development. we searched for cis-regulatory sequences within abdominal-b (abd-b), a homeotic drosophila gene, by testing genomic abd-b fragments for their ability to confer beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) expression in transformed embryos. one of the abd-b fragments, called iab5, mediates a beta-gal pattern restricted along the body axis to the abd-b expression domain. alterations of the iab5 pattern in gap mutants provide evidence that the protein products of the gap genes hunchback, krüppel and knirps act as repressors through iab5. the anterior abd-b expression limit is apparently determined by krüppel repression, whereas the knirps repressor may be responsible for the graded abd-b expression within the abd-b domain. iab5 and two other fragments called mcp and fab show region-specific silencing activity: they suppress at a distance beta-gal expression mediated by a linked heterologous enhancer. silencing requires hunchback as well as polycomb function and evidently provides maintenance of abd-b expression limits throughout embryogenesis. we conclude that transcriptional repression is a key mechanism operating at multiple levels to control abd-b expression. the striking similarities between the control of abd-b and of ultrabithorax, another homeotic drosophila gene, may point to a universal principle underlying homeotic gene regulation.

--------------------

during drosophila embryogenesis, position along the anteroposterior axis is specified within each segment by the products of the segment-polarity genes which include wingless (wg) and gooseberry (gsb). the striped expression of these genes in each segment is initially established by the pair-rule gene products during late blastoderm. this pattern is subsequently maintained after germ band extension by interaction among the segment-polarity genes themselves. here we show that the maintenance of gsb, a phox gene encoding a paired-domain and a homeodomain, is controlled by the wg signal, the homolog of the murine wnt-1 protein. a control element responsible for wg-dependent maintenance of gsb expression, gsb-late element, is separable from an element required for the initial activation of gsb by pair-rule transcription factors, gsb-early element. the significance of such a regulatory strategy is discussed with respect to the establishment and maintenance of cell states within each segment by segment-polarity genes.

--------------------

homeotic genes often use autoregulation as a mechanism to maintain their expression. autoregulation of ultrabithorax (ubx) in the visceral mesoderm is at least partly indirect and mediated by extracellular signalling from wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp). ubx controls the localized expression of these two extracellular proteins. here, we identify separate wg and dpp response elements within upstream sequences of ubx. our evidence suggests that there are two distinct response factors each of which, after signal-induced activation, mediates transcriptional activation through its cognate element, whereas each element is recognized by a repressor in the absence of the corresponding signal. we show that the response factors and other components for transmission of the wg and, probably, of the dpp signal are present throughout the midgut mesoderm. thus, there may be ubiquitous repression, preventing ubx autoregulation throughout the visceral mesoderm, which is relieved locally by wg and dpp signalling. evidently, the two signals convey positional information, allowing visceral mesoderm cells to reassess their position at advanced stages of embryogenesis and to decide whether or not to maintain expression of a homeotic gene.

the homeotic selector (hom) proteins are required for the diversification of the anterior-posterior axis of the drosophila body plan, assigning unique identities to regional domains of cells comprising one or a few parasegments or segments. the hom proteins apparently accomplish this task by the transcriptional regulation of numerous downstream genes. at present few downstream genes are known, so models of how downstream genes mediate hom functions are based more on intuition than information. our results indicate that distal-less is a downstream gene of the hom gene deformed, and distal-less function is required for the elaboration of a subset of the maxillary epidermal identities specified by deformed. the regulatory effect of deformed on distal-less is mediated by a ventral maxillary-specific enhancer located 3' of the distal-less transcription unit. we propose that deformed and distal-less, both of which encode homeodomain transcription factors that are persistently expressed in ventral maxillary cells, combinatorially specify a subsegmental code required for a group of cells to differentiate maxillary cirri.

whereas the mechanisms of early drosophila mesoderm formation have been studied in much detail, the subsequent processes determining regional identities within the mesoderm remain largely unknown. here, we describe two homeo box genes, tinman (tin) and bagpipe (bap), which spatially subdivide the mesoderm and determine cell fates in the dorsal mesoderm. these two genes are components of a cascade of genetic interactions that result in the spatial restriction of tin mrna to the dorsal mesoderm and in the activation of bap in segmental clusters of cells in this region. a subset of cells from those clusters segregate to form visceral mesoderm that differentiates into gut musculature. this indicates that the visceral mesoderm is derived from metamerically repeated primordia. in embryos mutant for bap, visceral mesoderm formation is strongly disrupted. most cells of the visceral mesoderm fail to differentiate properly, and a portion of them are transformed into body wall musculature and gonadal mesoderm. in tin mutant embryos, bap expression is not activated in the dorsal mesoderm. probably as a consequence, neither visceral mesoderm nor midgut musculature are formed in these mutants, and the absence of visceral mesoderm results in strong disruptions of endoderm migration and midgut morphogenesis. in addition to visceral mesoderm development, tin is required for the formation of the heart from dorsal mesoderm and for the specification of founder cells for particular body wall muscles.

the drosophila snail (sna) gene is first expressed in cells giving rise to mesoderm and is required for mesoderm formation. sna is subsequently expressed in the developing nervous system. sna expression during neurogenesis evolves from segmentally repeated neuroectodermal domains to a pan-neural pattern. we have identified a 2.8 kb regulatory region of the sna promoter that drives lacz expression in a faithful neuronal pattern. deletion analysis of this region indicates that the pan-neural element is composed of separable cns and pns components. this finding is unexpected since all known genes controlling early neurogenesis, including the proneural genes (i.e. da and as-c), are expressed in both the cns and pns. we also show that expression of sna during neurogenesis is largely independent of the proneural genes da and as-c. the separate control of cns and pns sna expression and independence of proneural gene regulation add to a growing body of evidence that current genetic models of neurogenesis are substantially incomplete.

we have constructed six new p-element-based drosophila melanogaster transformation vectors that specifically allow for the high-level accumulation of any rna of interest in the developing egg and pre-blastoderm embryo. such specificity results, in part, from the inclusion in the vectors of an enhancer active exclusively in nurse cells, the principal providers of rna to the egg and early embryo. the nurse cell enhancer was derived from the hsp26 heat-shock (hs) gene, but its activity was neither dependent on nor sensitive to hs. in addition to the nurse cell enhancer, two of the vectors contain sequences from the k10 gene that promote the early transfer of rnas from nurse cells into the oocyte; rnas that contain the k10 sequence are transferred into the oocyte during the early to middle stages of oogenesis (i.e., during stages 2-9), while rnas that lack such sequences are stored in nurse cells until stage 11. all of the vectors contain a tsp and a multiple cloning site (mcs) immediately downstream from the hsp26 nurse cell enhancer. in three of the vectors, the mcs is preceded by an atg start codon. a wild-type copy of the white gene is included in all of the vectors as a selectable marker for transformation. the specificity of the vectors was demonstrated by the analysis of the expression patterns of lacz derivatives.

the appendages of arthropods and vertebrates possess a third, proximodistal patterning axis that is established after the primary anteroposterior and dorsoventral body axes by mechanisms that are largely unknown. the vestigial gene is required for formation of the entire drosophila wing, and the dorsal/ventral boundary is shown to organize wing formation and vestigial gene expression. interactions between dorsal and ventral cells in the growing imaginal disc induce vestigial gene expression through a discrete, extraordinarily conserved imaginal disc-specific enhancer. the link between dorsal/ventral compartmentalization and wing formation distinguishes the development of this sheet-like appendage from that of legs and antennae.

patterns of decapentaplegic (dpp) transcripts derived from the intact gene were compared to the patterns of transcripts generated by partial dpp transgenes in drosophila embryos. sequences closest to the dpp coding regions, the dpp hin region, were sufficient to express lacz-tagged mrna in patterns indistinguishable from the patterns of endogenous dpp expression in the dorsal and terminal cells at the blastoderm stage, in the dorsal ectoderm during germ band elongation, and in narrow stripes of ectodermal cells along the dorsal edge of the ectoderm and at the boundary between the lateral and ventral neurogenic regions during germ band shortening. the latter pattern of expression responded to the segment polarity genes naked and wingless. however, these dpp sequences were not sufficient to drive lacz-tagged mrna expression in other cells normally expressing dpp, including cells in the gnathal segments, the clypeolabrum, the foregut, the midgut visceral mesoderm, and the hindgut. two separate regulatory regions were found in the dpp hin region. a 479 bp region upstream of the promoter was necessary for the segmented pattern of expression in the lateral ectoderm and for expression in the midgut endoderm. cis-acting elements in the 2 kbp second intron directed expression in the dorsal and terminal regions of the blastoderm, acted on a heterologous promoter, the p-element promoter, and responded to pattern information derived from the maternal effect dorsal/ventral patterning genes.

the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) is involved in setting up the anterior-posterior axis of the drosophila embryo. it is expressed maternally and zygotically and it plays a key role in integrating the effects of the anterior and posterior maternal systems. the hb gene from d. virilis has previously been cloned and was shown to be well conserved in its coding region, but less so in its upstream region which shows a more patchy pattern of conserved and diverged sequences. this work deals with the functional conservation of hb between the two species. we have mapped two additional regulatory elements for the expression of hb in the early embryo, namely the enhancer for the maternal expression and the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression. fragments containing these two elements, the previously identified bicoid dependent element for the early blastoderm expression of hb and the coding region were taken from d. virilis and tested in the d. melanogaster background. we find that all enhancer elements as well as the coding region are functionally conserved between the two species. comparison of the upstream sequences that include the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression reveal seven highly conserved blocks. some of these contain consensus binding sites for transregulatory factors that are likely to control the respective expression domains.

while maternally provided factors play essential roles in the earliest processes of embryogenesis, little is known about the control of female germline-specific gene expression. primer extension analysis and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that in adult drosophila females, transcripts of the gap gene hunchback (hb) are produced only by the distal (p1) promoter and that this expression is largely restricted to the ovarian nurse cells. a deletion analysis of the hb promoter using lacz reporter constructs defines a 1.2-kb genomic dna fragment surrounding the p1 promoter that is sufficient to reproduce the wild-type pattern of hb ovarian transcript accumulation. by contrast, the subfragments of this region we have tested fail to direct specific ovarian expression.

the drosophila melanogaster vital gene, embryonic lethal abnormal visual system (elav), is required for the postdeterminative development of the nervous system. its gene product encodes an rna binding protein that was found to be expressed in all neurons right after their birth. this specific, ubiquitous, and continuous pattern of neural expression has led to the increasingly popular use of elav protein as a neural-specific marker. to understand the molecular basis of this neural-specific expression, we have defined and analyzed the structure of the elav promoter. cis-acting sequences important for conferring the neural specificity of elav expression were identified by analyzing the reporter gene expression in transformants carrying different elav-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. this analysis delimits a 333-bp region (-92 to +241) that is necessary for specifying the elav pattern of nervous system expression. a 3.5-kb promoter fragment encompassing this region was designed for targeting gene expression specifically to the nervous system and would be a useful tool for the analysis of nervous system function.

the maternal-effect gene dorsal encodes the ventral morphogen that is essential for elaboration of ventral and ventrolateral fates in the drosophila embryo. dorsal belongs to the rel family of transcription factors and controls asymmetric expression of zygotic genes along the dorsoventral axis. the dorsal protein is cytoplasmic in early embryos, possibly because of a direct interaction with cactus. in response to a ventral signal, dorsal protein becomes partitioned into nuclei of cleavage-stage syncytial blastoderms such that the ventral nuclei have the maximum amount of dorsal protein, and the lateral and dorsal nuclei have progressively less protein. here we show that transgenic flies containing the dorsal cdna, which is driven by the constitutively active hsp83 promoter, exhibits rescue of the dorsal- phenotype. transformed lines were used to increase the level of dorsal protein. females with dorsal levels roughly twice that of wild-type produced normal embryos, while a higher level of dorsal protein resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed for loss-of-function cactus mutations. by manipulating the cactus gene dose, we found that in contrast to a dorsal/cactus ratio of 2.5 which resulted in fully penetrant weak ventralization, a cactus/dorsal ratio of 3.0 was acceptable by the system. by manipulating dorsal levels in different cactus and dorsal group mutant backgrounds, we found that the relative amounts of ventral signal to that of the dorsal-cactus complex is important for the elaboration of the normal dorsoventral pattern. we propose that in a wild-type embryo, the activities of dorsal and cactus are not independently regulated; excess cactus activity is deployed only if a higher level of dorsal protein is available. based on these results we discuss how the ventral signal interacts with the dorsal-cactus complex, thus forming a gradient of nuclear dorsal protein.

the dorsal protein (dl) regulates the transcriptional activity of several genes that determine cell fate along the dorsoventral axis of the drosophila melanogaster embryo. dl is present at high levels in ventral nuclei, where it activates some genes (twi and sna) and represses others (zen, dpp, and tld). dl shows homology to the rel family of proteins and interacts with specific dna sequences in the regulatory regions of its target genes. the distal portion of the zen gene acts as a silencer that can mediate the repression of a heterologous promoter in ventral regions of the embryo. it contains four dl binding sites which alone are sufficient for activation but not repression. here we analyze the interaction of dl with another one of its repressed targets, the tolloid (tld) gene. approximately 800 bp of 5'-flanking sequences upstream of the tld coding region were shown to drive an expression pattern indistinguishable from the wild-type pattern. a 423-bp fragment located within these sequences contains two dl binding sites and was shown to act as a silencer to mediate ventral repression. point mutations in the sites abolish not only dna binding but also ventral repression. we discuss a comparison of the dna sequences from the zen and tld promoters and the possible mechanisms of transcriptional silencing.

the esterase 6 gene (est-6) of drosophila melanogaster is expressed in a variety of tissues that differ between larval and adult stages and among related species. variability in the level of expression of this locus among different species and strains and its species- and tissue-specific patterns of expression make it a useful system for studying the evolution of gene regulation in drosophila. we have begun to determine the location of the regulatory regions of est-6 by constructing deletion mutants of the 5' regions of the gene and transforming them back into flies. deletion mutants of the putative 5' promoter regions of est-6 were fused to the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) and assayed for their ability to direct tissue-specific expression in transformed d. melanogaster adults. we have identified four independently acting est-6 regulatory regions that direct the expression of lacz in (i) the ejaculatory duct; (ii) the adult salivary glands; (iii) the respiratory system, prefrons, antennae, and maxillary palps; and (iv) the ejaculatory bulb and prefrons. we also found a region near the start of transcription that directed expression of est-6 in the cardia or proventriculus in some transformed lines.

the mammalian transcription factor nf-kappa b regulates a number of genes involved in immune and acute phase responses, by interacting with a nucleotide sequence element, the kappa b-motif. in this work we demonstrate the participation of similar motifs in the immune response of insects as well: kappa b-like motifs have a regulatory role in the synthesis of cecropins, a set of anti-bacterial peptides, triggered by the presence of bacterial cell wall components in the insect blood. we show that the upstream region of the cecropin gene ceca1 contains elements responsible for inducible and tissue-specific expression. furthermore, a trimer of kappa b-like motif confers high levels of inducible expression from the reporter gene, after transfection in a drosophila blood cell line. as in the moth hyalophora cecropia, stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide induces a nuclear factor that specifically binds to the kappa b-like motif. our data suggest a functional and evolutionary relationship between these insect immune response factors and the mammalian nf-kappa b.

the expression of the drosophila segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is controlled at the level of transcription. the proximal enhancer, located approximately 3.4 kb upstream of the transcription start site, directs lacz fusion gene expression in a ftz-like seven-stripe pattern in transgenic fly embryos. we have taken a biochemical approach to identify dna-binding proteins that regulate ftz gene expression through the proximal enhancer. dnase i footprinting and methylation interference experiments with staged drosophila embryo nuclear extracts identified nine protein binding sites in the proximal enhancer. ten different sequence-specific dna-binding complexes that interact with eight of these sites were identified. some interact with multiple sites, while others bind to single sites in the enhancer. two of the complexes that interact with multiple sites appear to contain the previously described ftz regulators, ftz-f1 and ttk/ftz-f2. these in vitro studies allowed us to narrow down the proximal enhancer to a 323-bp dna fragment that contains all of the protein binding sites. expression directed by this minimal enhancer element in seven ftz-like stripes in transgenic embryos is identical to that directed by the full-length enhancer. internal deletions of several sites abolish reporter gene expression in vivo. thus, the ftz proximal enhancer, like other cell-type-specific eukaryotic enhancers, interacts with an array of proteins that are expected to mediate the establishment, maintenance, and repression of transcription of the ftz gene in seven stripes in the developing embryo.

the drosophila decapentaplegic gene (dpp) encodes a tgf-beta family member involved in signal transduction during embryonic midgut formation. the shortvein (shv) class of cis-regulatory dpp mutants disrupt expression in parasegments 4 and 7 (ps4 and ps7) of the embryonic visceral mesoderm (vm) surrounding the gut and cause abnormalities in gut morphogenesis. we demonstrate that cis-regulatory elements directing expression in ps4 and ps7 are separable and identify dna fragments that generate ps4 and ps7 expression patterns using reporter gene constructs. dpp reporter gene expression in both ps4 and ps7 is autoregulated as it requires endogenous dpp+ activity. reporter gene ps7 expression requires the wild-type action of ultra-bithorax (ubx), and abdominal-a. furthermore, the expression of certain ubx reporter genes is coincident with dpp in the vm. both the mis-expression of ubx reporter genes in the developing gastric caecae at ps4 and its normal expression in ps7 are dependent upon endogenous dpp+ activity. we conclude that dpp both responds to and regulates ubx in ps7 of the visceral mesoderm and that ubx autoregulation within this tissue may be indirect as it requires more components than have previously been thought.

the core activity of the ubx gene enhancer bre (bx region enhancer) is encoded within a 500 bp module. bx dna outside this active module increases the level of expression, expands the expression into ventro-lateral ectoderm and partially stabilizes the late expression pattern. the products of the gap genes hb and tll and of the pair-rule gene ftz bind to the 500 bp bre module and control directly its initial pattern of expression. ftz enhances expression in even-numbered parasegments within the correct spatial domain whose boundaries are set by hb and tll. in addition, en and twi products activate the enhancer, probably directly. en broadens the parasegmental stripe while twi cooperates with ftz to enhance expression in the mesoderm. binding sites for the five regulators are closely clustered, often overlapping extensively with one another. in vitro, hb blocks the binding of ftz and can also displace ftz protein pre-bound to an overlapping site, suggesting that competitive binding and/or interference by hb sets the initial boundaries of the domain of expression. our results also suggest that this interaction is short-range and the long distance interactions among different enhancers may depend on each enhancer's ability to complex with the promoter.

muscle development involves the coordinated regulation of transcription of muscle-type-specific genes and their encoded proteins during myogenesis. we show here that transcriptional regulation of the drosophila tropomyosin i (tmi) gene during myogenesis is under the control of at least two muscle enhancer regions located within the first intron of the gene. together these enhancer regions contain multiple muscle-type-specific positive and negative cis-acting elements which together contribute toward full expression of the gene. one of these enhancers is contained within a 355-bp fragment that is sufficient to direct high levels of temporally regulated expression from a heterologous promoter in all muscles of transgenic flies. dissection of this enhancer region into smaller fragments has allowed us to identify a 91-bp enhancer fragment sufficient for directing expression in all somatic and visceral muscles of the larva and adult but not in the indirect flight muscles and tergal depressor of the trochanter or jump muscles of the adult. we also show that this somatic/visceral muscle element(s) can be repressed through an adjacent negative control region, suggesting that the regulation of expression in these muscles is under dual control during both phases of myogenesis. we propose a model in which transcriptional regulation of the drosophila tmi gene is controlled by the cooperative interaction of multiple positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements that control the temporal and muscle-type pattern of expression. the distribution of enhancer elements and their control of tmi gene expression are similar to those regulating transcription of the muscle promoter of the tmii gene and provide a framework for the coordinate expression of the two genes.

during drosophila embryogenesis, the beta 1 tubulin gene (beta tub56d) is expressed in the cns and pns as well as in the apodemes. in this report we determine the regulation of beta 1 tubulin gene expression during formation of the attachment sites of the somatic muscles, the apodemes. the process was analysed in transgenic flies carrying beta 1 enhancer-hsp70 promoter-lacz fusion constructs. expression is first detected at late stage 13 and remains until hatching. by deletion analysis of the intron we identified a 14-bp element present in three copies. this element represents a classical enhancer, as it acts on a heterologous promoter. separate fragments containing the respective elements yield nearly identical expression patterns, and no cooperativity was observed between the three copies. thus, the expression of the beta 1 tubulin gene in the apodemes is under control of redundant enhancer elements. double staining for beta 1 tubulin gene expression in apodemes and for beta 3 tubulin gene expression in muscles allowed us to correlate apodeme and muscle formation. cells of the apodemes that are in contact with their corresponding muscles show expression of the reporter gene as monitored by antibody staining.

at the poles of the drosophila embryo, cell fate is established by a pathway that begins with the activation of a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (the torso gene product); this then leads to activation of a serine/threonine kinase (drosophila raf-1). activated raf-1 then leads, by an undefined mechanism, to the transcriptional activation of the tailless (tll) gene; the tll gene product, itself a transcription factor, subsequently regulates the expression of an array of target genes. to further define this pathway, we have utilized sequence comparison between drosophila melanogaster and drosophila virilis to identify conserved elements in the tll promoter region. as assessed by dnase i footprinting and promoter dissection experiments, two of these elements are potential regulatory targets of raf-1-activated transcription factors. sequence comparison also reveals that the unique residues in the dna-binding domain of the tll protein, the next component in the pathway, are conserved. one of these residues, the alanine after the last cysteine in the first zinc finger, may be responsible for part of the difference between the tll protein dna binding site and the closely related half-site of the retinoid/estrogen receptors. consistent with the rapid turnover of the tll protein, it contains a pest sequence (rich in proline, glutamate and aspartate, serine, and threonine) that is also conserved.

we have used lacz reporter gene constructs to study the promoter/enhancer regions of the drosophila fmrfamide neuropeptide gene in germ line transformants. fmrfamide is normally expressed in approximately 60 diverse neurons of the larval cns that represent approximately 15 distinct cell types. an 8 kb fmrfamide dna fragment (including 5 kb of 5' upstream sequence) was sufficient to direct a pattern of lacz expression that mimicked nearly all spatial aspects of the normal pattern. this result indicates that the cell-specific regulation of fmrfamide expression is largely generated by transcriptional mechanisms. reporter gene expression was lost from selected cell types when smaller fragments were tested, suggesting that multiple control regions are included in the fmrfamide promoter. one region (a 300 bp fragment from -476 to -162) acted as an enhancer for 1 of the approximately 15 fmrfamide-positive cell types, the ol2 neurons. these results suggest that, in the mature nervous system, the complex pattern of fmrfamide neuropeptide gene expression derives from the activity of discrete, cell type-specific enhancers that are independently regulated.

the adult appendages of drosophila are formed from imaginal discs, sheets of epithelial cells that proliferate during larval development and differentiate during metamorphosis. wingless (wg, dwnt-1) protein, a putative signaling molecule, is expressed only in prospective ventral cells in each of the leg discs. to test the role of wg, we have generated randomly positioned clones of cells that express wg protein constitutively. clones that arise in the prospective ventral portions of the leg discs develop normally. in contrast, dorsally situated clones give rise to ventrolateral patterns and exert a ventralizing influence on neighboring wild-type tissue. we propose that wg protein organizes leg pattern along the dorsoventral axis by conferring ventral positional information within the disc.

three different maternal morphogen gradients regulate expression of the gap gene tailless (tll), which is required to establish the acron and telson of the drosophila embryo. to identify elements in the tll promoter that respond to these different maternal systems, we have generated promoter-lacz fusions and transformed them into the germline. expression of these constructs in both wild type and mutant embryos revealed the presence of at least two separate but synergistically interacting regions that mediate tll expression by the terminal system. this functional synergism between regulatory elements may play a role in the translation of the torso (tor) morphogen gradient into the sharp boundary of tll gene activity. in addition to regions mediating activation by the terminal system, regions mediating both activation and repression by bicoid (bcd), and repression by dorsal (dl) were identified. binding sites of bcd protein in a 0.5 kb region, revealed by dnasei footprinting, could be crucial for the bcd-dependent activation of tll expression in the anterior stripe.

the dorsal (dl) morphogen gradient initiates the formation of the mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and dorsal ectoderm by setting different limits of regulatory gene expression along the dorsoventral axis of the early drosophila embryo. in this paper, we show that low affinity dl-binding sites restrict target gene expression to the ventralmost regions (presumptive mesoderm), where there are peak levels of dl, while high affinity sites permit expression in ventrolateral regions (mesoderm and mesectoderm) containing intermediate levels of the morphogen. activation by low levels of dl in lateral regions (the presumptive neuroectoderm) depends on cooperative dna binding interactions between dl and bhlh proteins. the snail repressor blocks this interaction and restricts expression to the neuroectoderm. we discuss how enhancers serve as templates to bring weakly interacting regulatory factors into close proximity so that they can function combinatorially to activate and repress transcription.

dna fragments from the 5' flanking region of drosophila melanogaster vitelline membrane gene vm26a1 were fused to hsp/lacz reporter genes, reintroduced via p-element-mediated germ line transformation, and functionally assayed by histological staining for beta-galactosidase activity. a developmental control element capable of promoting the basic vitelline membrane (vm) expression pattern was found within a 176-bp region. additional multiple genetic control elements were found to be involved in modifying the level and spatial pattern of reporter gene expression but these required the 176-bp element in order to function. unexpectedly, in isolation this 176-bp core element also promotes abnormal expression of the reporter gene in border cells of stage 8 and 9 egg chambers. this abnormal border cell expression is apparently suppressed in the native gene by an adjacent negative control element.

the drosophila cns midline cells comprise a small, well-characterized group of neurons and glia in which the transcriptional control of cns development can be studied. using germ-line transformation of lacz fusion constructs, we have dissected putative regulatory regions of the slit and toll genes to identify cns midline-restricted transcriptional enhancers. this analysis has uncovered dna regions able to drive lacz expression in most tissues in which embryonic slit and toll are expressed, including three separable cns midline-conferring regions: one in the toll gene which is expressed early in all of the cns midline precursors, and two in the slit gene which are expressed later in the midline glia (mg).

proper development of the midline cells within the drosophila central nervous system is controlled by the single-minded (sim) gene. the sim protein defines a new subclass of bhlh transcription factors and as such, is predicted to function as a transcriptional regulator of other genes important for midline development. here we identify two potential targets of sim regulation: the sim gene itself, and the 47f gene, which is expressed specifically in the sim-expressing midline cells. using a transgene containing sim regulatory sequences fused to beta-galactosidase, we show that the sim gene uses two distinct promoters with overlapping temporal specificities, and that expression from the late promoter is autoregulated by sim itself. by expressing sim protein in salivary gland nuclei using the heat-shock inducible hsp70 gene promoter, we show that sim protein associates with the sim late promoter on polytene chromosomes. in addition, sim protein binds to a small number of additional chromosomal sites, among which are the sites of the 47f gene, and two other genes, tl and cdi, whose expression also depend on sim function.

the dorsal morphogen is a transcription factor that activates some genes and represses others to establish multiple domains of gene expression along the dorsal/ventral axis of the early drosophila embryo. repression by dorsal appears to require accessory proteins that bind to corepression elements in dorsal-dependent regulatory modules called ventral repression regions (vrrs). we have identified a corepression element in decapentaplegic (dpp), a zygotically active gene that is repressed by the dorsal morphogen. this dpp repression element (dre) is located within a previously identified vrr and close to essential dorsal-binding sites. we have purified a factor from drosophila embryo extracts that binds to the dre but not to mutant forms of the dre that fail to support efficient repression. this protein also binds to an apparently essential region in a vrr associated with the zerknüllt (zen) gene. one of the dres in the dpp vrr overlaps the binding site for a potential activator protein suggesting that one mechanism of ventral repression may be the mutually exclusive binding of repressor and activator proteins. we have found the dre-binding protein to be identical to ntf-1 (equivalent to elf-1, the product of the grainyhead gene), a factor originally identified as an activator of the ultrabithorax and dopa decarboxylase promoters. ntf-1 mrna is synthesized during oogenesis and deposited in the developing oocyte where it is available to contribute to ventral repression during early embryogenesis. previous studies have shown that overexpression of ntf-1 in the postblastoderm embryo results in a phenotype that is consistent with a role for this factor in the repression of dpp later in embryogenesis.

the drosophila gene buttonhead (btd) encodes a zinc-finger protein related to the human transcription factor sp1. btd is expressed in the syncytial blastoderm embryo in a stripe covering the anlagen of the antennal, intercalary and mandibular head segments. btd has been characterized as a head gap gene, since these segments are deleted in btd mutant embryos. we report here that the cis-acting elements required for btd head stripe expression are contained in a 1 kb dna fragment, located about 3 kb upstream of the promoter. the four maternal coordinate systems are necessary for correct btd head stripe expression, likely by acting through the 1 kb cis-acting control region. expression of the btd head stripe depends on the anterior morphogen encoded by the gene bicoid (bcd). bcd-dependent activation also involves the activity of the morphogens of the posterior and dorsoventral systems, hunchback and dorsal, respectively, which act together to control the spatial limits of the expression domain. finally, the terminal system takes part in the regulation of btd head stripe expression by enhancing activation at low levels of activity and repression at high levels of activity.

asense is a member of the achaete-scute complex (as-c) of helix-loop-helix genes involved in drosophila neurogenesis. unlike the other as-c members, which are expressed in subsets of the ectodermal areas (proneural clusters) that give rise to neural precursors, asense is one of a number of genes that are specifically expressed in the neural precursors themselves (neural precursor genes). we have identified a mutant asense phenotype that may reflect this later expression pattern. as a step in understanding the determination of neural precursors from the proneural clusters, we have investigated the potential role of the as-c products as direct transcriptional activators of neural precursor genes by analysing the regulation of asense. using genomic rescues and asense-lacz fusion genes, the neural precursor regulatory element has been identified. we show that this element contains binding sites for as-c/daughterless heterodimers. delection of these sites reduces the expression from the fusion gene, but significant expression is still achieved, pointing to the existence of other regulators of asense in addition to the as-c. asense differs from the other as-c members in its expression pattern, regulation, mutant phenotype and some dna-binding properities.

drosophila photoreceptor cells (r cells) develop from the eye imaginal during the third instar larval stage and acquire their adult morphology during pupation. we show that orthodenticle (otd), a homeobox gene, is required for r-cell morphogenesis during pupation. otduv-insensitive (otduvi) is a hypomorphic allele of otd that only affects r-cell development. the r-cell rhabdomeres are disorganized in otduvi, and there is a disruption of proximal-distal development in the eye. the otd genomic structure was determined and resulted in the identification of a deletion in the third intron of otduvi. sequences encompassing this deletion are able to direct expression of the lacz reporter gene at all stages of the developing visual system, including the photosensitive cells of bolwig's organ, the ocelli, and the adult eye. the third intron enhancer is the primary regulatory element controlling otd in the r cells and is not under the control of the glass gene.

the drosophila pan-neural genes deadpan (dpn) and scratch (scrt) are expressed in most or all developing neural precursor cells of the central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns). we have identified a cis-acting enhancer element driving full pan-neural expression of the dpn gene which is composed of independent cns- and pns-specific subelements. we have also identified cns- and pns-specific subelements of the scrt enhancer. deletion analysis of the dpn and scrt pns-specific subelements reveals that pns specificity of these two evolutionarily unrelated enhancers is achieved in part by repression of cns expression. we discuss the implications of the striking organizational similarities of the dpn, scrt, and sna pan-neural enhancers.

we have identified a novel drosophila homeodomain gene, unplugged (unp), whose function is required for formation of the tracheal branches that penetrate the cns. in unp mutant embryos the segmentally repeated ganglionic branches stall and fail to penetrate the cns and the segment-specific cerebral branch and associated cerebral anastomosis fail to form. expression of unp in the founder cells for the cerebral branch within the first tracheal metamere is repressed in posterior segments by ubx and other bithorax complex genes. this pattern of expression and homeotic gene regulation is reproduced by an unusual 2.6 kb cis-regulatory sequence located downstream of the unp transcription unit. since the unp protein is localized to the nucleus of tracheal precursor cells as they migrate and extend, unp protein appears to play a regulatory role in neural branching of the tracheae, and the segment-specific aspects of these neural branching patterns appear to be generated by homeotic regulation of unp expression.

the expression domain of the ubx gene in drosophila embryos is bounded by the product of the hb gene, acting as a repressor. we show that all ubx fragments that bind hb protein in vitro contain parasegmental enhancers active in the embryo in specific parasegmental patterns. we have found three new embryonic enhancer elements in the upstream region, in addition to the two previously identified. each produces a pattern initially bounded at ps6 by hb but sooner or later breaks down this boundary and begins to express in the anterior region. these enhancers do not respond to the long-term maintenance mediated by the polycomb group of genes. they also cease functioning after germ band extension. expression in imaginal tissues is due to a set of entirely separate and independent imaginal disc enhancers. these do not contain hb binding sites and by themselves have no anterior/posterior positional information, although some distinguish between ventral and dorsal discs. a third kind of element, the polycomb response element (pre), has no enhancer activity but causes long-term maintenance of the expression domain of other enhancers present in the vicinity. the interaction of these elements results in the correct expression of ubx in imaginal tissues.

the rapid turnover of luciferase and the sensitive, non-invasive nature of its assay make this reporter gene uniquely situated for temporal gene expression studies. to determine the in vivo regulatory pattern of the drosophila clock gene period (per), we generated transgenic strains carrying a luciferase cdna fused to the promoter region of the per gene. this has allowed us to monitor circadian rhythms of bioluminescence from pacemaker cells within the head for several days in individual living adults. these high time-resolution experiments permitted neuronal per transcription and opens the door to vastly simplified experiments in general chronobiology and studies of temporally regulated transcription in a wide range of experimental systems.

previous studies on the regulation of the segmentation gene even-skipped (eve) have centered on the transcription of stripe 2. here, we characterize another enhancer module contained within the complex eve promoter that directs expression of stripes 3 and 7. this enhancer is approximately 500 bp in length and maps approximately 3.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site. the stripe 3 + 7 enhancer appears to be regulated by one or more ubiquitously distributed activators, including components of a jak-stat pathway. the two-stripe pattern results via multiple tiers of repressors which delimit this ubiquitous activation. the zinc finger repressor hunchback appears to be responsible for establishing the anterior border of stripe 3 and the posterior border of stripe 7. knirps, a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, appears to establish the posterior border of stripe 3 and the anterior border of stripe 7. activator and repressor proteins bind in vitro to several sites within the enhancer. these findings suggest a general model for the regulation of segmentation stripes, whereby enhancers integrate positional information provided by broadly distributed activators and spatially restricted repressors.

somatic muscle is derived from a subset of embryonic mesoderm. in drosophila, twist (twi), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a candidate regulator of mesodermal differentiation and myogenesis. altering amounts of twist after gastrulation revealed that high levels of twist are required for somatic myogenesis and block the formation of other mesodermal derivatives. expression of twist in the ectoderm drives these cells into myogenesis. thus, after an initial role in gastrulation, twist regulates mesodermal differentiation and propels a specific subset of mesodermal cells into somatic myogenesis. vertebrate homologs of twist may also participate in the subdivision of mesoderm.

mef2 (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2) is a mads box transcription factor that is thought to be a key regulator of myogenesis in vertebrates. mutations in the drosophila homologue of the mef2 gene indicate that it plays a key role in regulating myogenesis in drosophila. we show here that the drosophila tropomyosin i (tmi) gene is a target gene for mef2 regulation. the tmi gene contains a proximal and a distal muscle enhancer within the first intron of the gene. we show that both enhancers contain a mef2 binding site and that a mutation in the mef2 binding site of either enhancer significantly reduces reporter gene expression in embryonic, larval, and adult somatic body wall muscles of transgenic flies. we also show that a high level of proximal enhancer-directed reporter gene expression in somatic muscles requires the cooperative activity of mef2 and a cis-acting muscle activator region located within the enhancer. thus, mef2 null mutant embryos show a significant reduction but not an elimination of tmi expression in the body wall myoblasts and muscle fibers that are present. surprisingly, there is little effect in these mutants on tmi expression in developing visceral muscles and dorsal vessel (heart), despite the fact that mef2 is expressed in these muscles in wild-type embryos, indicating that tmi expression is regulated differently in these muscles. taken together, our results show that mef2 is a positive regulator of tropomyosin gene transcription that is necessary but not sufficient for high level expression in somatic muscle of the embryo, larva, and adult.

transcriptional regulators utilizing the pou domain dna-binding motif have been shown to form multi-protein complexes dependent on the pou domain itself and its flexible recognition of various octamer sequence elements. we have identified two variant pou domain recognition elements dfre1 and dfre2, which are found within a 514-bp autoregulatory enhancer of the drosophila melanogaster pou domain gene drifter (dfr). both elements are capable of binding bacterially produced full-length dfr protein with high affinity, although they differ in the 5'-to-3' orientation of pou-specific and pou homeodomain subelements. when placed in dfr loss-of-function genetic backgrounds, all expression of dfr-lacz fusion genes under control of the autoregulatory enhancer is dependent on dfr activity levels. however, the complete enhancer sequence directs beta-galactosidase expression in only a subset of cells which normally express the endogenous dfr protein, including the middle pair of midline glias of the ventral nerve cord, the oenocyte clusters, and all tracheal cells. in addition, dfre1 and dfre2 exhibit separable tissue-specific functions when independently disrupted or deleted. disruption of dfre1 function specifically abolishes beta-galactosidase expression in the middle pair of midline glias. deletion of dfre causes a specific loss of tracheal expression, leaving oenocyte and midline glia expression intact. these results suggest that dfr cell-specific autoregulation is determined by the context of dfr pou domain binding within the enhancer, which is possibly mediated by the formation of recognition element-specific heteromultimeric complexes containing additional tissue-specific factors.

"the segmented body pattern of the drosophila embryo is established through a hierarchical network of interacting genes. at each successive step in this pathway, transcriptional regulation is used to convert coarse positional information into finer patterns of gene expression. central to this process are the cis-regulatory regions that drive the dynamic spatial expression of the different segmentation genes. here we describe the cis-regulatory region of the runt gene. as found for both other primary pair-rule genes, hairy and even-skipped, there are stripe-specific elements which mediate the initial regulation of runt stripes by gap genes. we did not find autoregulatory elements as described for even-skipped and fushi tarazu. the regulation of runt by other pair-rule genes is mediated by a large region, extending over 5 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site. this ""disperse"" element cannot be subdivided into functionally independent subelements or minimal elements. such disperse elements mediating pair-rule gene interactions may have escaped detection in other segmentation genes and may involve molecular mechanisms different from those mediating regulation by gap genes."

an analysis was carried out on the promoter region of the drosophila dna polymerase alpha 73-kda subunit gene and the factor(s) activating the promoter. transcription initiation sites were newly identified in the region downstream of the previously determined sites. full promoter activity resided within the region from -285 to +129 base pairs with respect to the newly determined major site. within this region, we found three sequences identical or similar to the dna replication-related element (dre), 5'-tatcgata, which is known as a common promoter-activating element for the drosophila dna polymerase alpha 180-kda subunit gene and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene. these sites were located at positions -77 to -70 (drealpha-i), -44 to -37 (drealpha-ii), and +3 to +10 (drealpha-iii). footprinting analysis using the recombinant dre-binding factor (dref) or kc cell nuclear extract demonstrated that dref can bind to all three dre-related sites. introduction of mutation in even one of the three dre-related sequences caused extensive reductions of the promoter activity and also the dref-binding activity of the promoter-containing fragment. the results indicate that the three dref-binding sites cooperate to enhance promoter activity of the dna polymerase alpha 73-kda subunit gene.

patterning and proliferation are coordinately controlled in the development of drosophila imaginal discs. localized expression of decapentaplegic (dpp) at the anterior-posterior and wingless (wg) at the dorsal-ventral compartment boundaries controls growth of the wing with respect to the a/p and d/v axes. the growth-promoting effects of these organizers are thought to be indirect, since growth is dispersed throughout the disc, and is not localized near the sources of wg or dpp. wg has also been implicated in proximal-distal patterning of the wing hinge. in this report, we present evidence that wg is principally required for local cell proliferation in the hinge. loss of wg expression leads to a local reduction in cell division, resulting in the deletion of a distinct set of wing hinge structures. ectopic activation of the wg pathway in cells of the wing hinge leads to overproliferation without repatterning, indicating that wg acts as a mitogen in this part of the disc. by contrast, overexpression of wg in the wing blade leads to repatterning and only secondarily to proliferation. these results suggest that the wg signal elicits very different responses in different regions of the wing imaginal disc.

the proteins necessary for signal transduction in cells responding to ligands of the tgf-beta family are largely unknown. we have previously identified mad (mothers against dpp), a gene that interacts with the tgf-beta family member encoded by decapentaplegic (dpp) in drosophila. assay of mad's role in the dpp-dependent events of embryonic midgut development demonstrates that mad is required for any response of the visceral mesoderm or endoderm to dpp signals from the visceral mesoderm. replacement of the normal dpp promoter with a heterologous (hsp70) promoter fails to restore dpp-dependent responses in mad mutant midguts. experiments utilizing mad transgenes regulated by tissue-specific promoters show that mad is required specifically in cells responding to dpp. immunohistochemical studies localize mad to the cytoplasm in all tissues examined. experiments in xenopus embryos demonstrate that drosophila mad can function in the signaling pathway of bmp-4, a vertebrate homolog of dpp. based on these results, we propose that mad is a highly conserved and essential element of the dpp signal transduction pathway.

appendage formation is organized by signals from discrete sources that presumably act upon downstream genes to control growth and patterning. the drosophila vestigial gene is selectively required for wing-cell proliferation, and is sufficient to induce outgrowths of wing tissue from eyes, legs and antennae. different signals activate separate enhancers to control vestigial expression: first, in the dorsal/ventral organizer through the notch pathway, and subsequently, in the developing wing blade by decapentaplegic and a signal from the dorsal/ventral organizer. signal integration must be a general feature of genes like vestigial, that regulate growth or patterning along more than one axis.

members of the hedgehog (hh) family of secreted proteins have been identified recently as key signaling molecules that regulate a variety of inductive interactions central to the development of both drosophila and vertebrates. despite their widespread importance, the way in which hh signals are transduced inside the cell remains poorly understood. the best candidate for a transcription factor that mediates hh signaling in drosophila is the product of the cubitus interruptus (ci) gene, a zinc finger protein that exhibits significant homology to protein products of the vertebrate gli gene family. here, we show that elevated levels of ci are sufficient to activate patched (ptc) and other hh target genes, even in the absence of hh activity. we also show that ci can function as a transcriptional activator in yeast and demonstrate that the zinc finger domain of the protein is sufficient for its target specificity. finally, we identify sequences in the promoter region of the ptc gene, a primary target of hh signaling, that are identical to the consensus-binding sequence of the gli protein and are required for reporter gene expression in response to hh activity. taken together, our results strongly support the role for ci as the transcriptional activator that mediates hh signaling.

the electrical properties of a cell are produced by the complement of ion channels that it expresses. to understand how ion-channel gene expression is regulated, we are studying the tissue-specific regulation of the slowpoke (slo) ca(2+)-activated k+ channel gene. this gene is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, in midgut and tracheal cells, and in the musculature of drosophila melanogaster. the entire transcriptional control region has been cloned previously and shown to reproduce the tissue and developmental expression pattern of the endogenous gene. here we demonstrate that s/o has at least four promoters distributed over approximately 4.5 kb of dna. promoter c1 and c1c display a tata box-like sequence at the appropriate distance from the transcription start site. promoters c1b and c2, however, are tata-less promoters. c1, c1b, and c1c transcripts differ in their leader sequence but share a common translation start site. c2 transcripts incorporate a new translation start site that appends 17 amino acids to the n terminus of the encoded protein. deletion analysis was used to identify sequences important for tissue-specific expression. we used a transgenic in vivo expression system in which all tissues and developmental stages can be assayed easily. six nested deletions were transformed into drosophila, and the expression pattern was determined using a lacz reporter in both dissected tissues and sectioned animals. we have identified different sequences required for expression in the cns, midgut, tracheal cells, and muscle.

the even-skipped (eve) pair-rule gene plays a key role in the establishment of the anterior-posterior segmental pattern of the drosophila embryo. the continuously changing pattern of eve expression can be resolved into two phases. early expression consists of seven broad stripes in the blastoderm embryo, while late expression, which occurs after cellularization, consists of narrow stripes with sharp anterior borders that coincide with the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries. previous studies have shown that these two phases are controlled by separate classes of cis elements in the eve promoter. early stripes are expressed by multiple stripe-specific elements under the control of maternal-effect genes and gap genes, while late stripes are expressed by a single regulatory element, the 'late element', under the control of pair-rule genes including eve itself. we report here that paired (prd), a pair-rule gene which had been considered to be below eve in the regulatory hierarchy of pair-rule genes, in fact plays a critical role in the regulation of late eve expression. transgenic analysis shows that this regulation is largely mediated by an evolutionarily conserved sequence within the late element termed pte (paired target element). in vitro analysis shows that the prd protein binds strongly to this sequence. interestingly, pte contains juxtaposed binding sites for the two dna-binding domains of the prd protein, the paired domain and the homeodomain. mutagenesis of either binding site leads to significant reduction in the activity of the late element, indicating that both dna-binding domains in the paired protein are required for regulation.

the drosophila melanogaster glass transcription factor acts in photoreceptor cell development, glass transcription in the developing eye begins in the morphogenetic furrow. we report a deletion analysis which shows that a 5147 bp fragment can confer near wild-type expression in the developing eye. we completed the sequence of a similar drosophila virilis fragment and comparison of these two genomic sequences reveals seven perfectly conserved sequence elements of 15 bp (or longer). we placed oligomers of each element 5' to an hsp70 promoter-lacz fusion construct, and examined the patterns of beta-galactosidase expression produced in transgenic files. three of these elements drive beta-galactosidase expression in the developing eye, and one is inhibitory.

using the previously cloned proteasome alpha-type subunit gene pros28.1, we screened a drosophila melanogaster genomic library using reduced stringency conditions to identify closely related genes. two new genes, pros28.1a (map position 92f) and pros28.1b (map position 60d7), showing high sequence similarity to pros28.1, were identified and characterized. pros28.1a encodes a protein with 74% amino acid identity to pros28.1, while the pros28.1b gene product is 58% identical. the pros28.1b gene has two introns, located in exactly analogous positions as the two introns in pros28.1, while the pros28.1a gene lacks introns. northern blot analysis reveals that the two new genes are expressed only in males, during the pupal and adult stages. tissue-specific patterns of expression were examined using transgenic flies carrying lacz-fusion reporter genes. this analysis revealed that both genes are expressed in germline cells during spermatogenesis, although their expression patterns differed. pros28.1a expression is first detected at the primary spermatocyte stage and persists into the spermatid elongation phase of spermiogenesis, while pros28.1b expression is prominent only during spermatid elongation. these genes represent the most striking example of cell-type-specific proteasome gene expression reported to date in any system and support the notion that there is structural and functional heterogeneity among proteasomes in metazoans.

the transcription factor ftz-f1 is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and is transiently expressed during the mid- and late prepupal periods in drosophila melanogaster. a putative pupal cuticle gene, edg84a, is expressed slightly following ftz-f1 expression during the prepupal period and carries a strong ftz-f1 binding site between bases 100 and 92 upstream of its transcription start site. in this study, edg84a mrna was found to be prematurely expressed upon heat induction of ftz-f1 in prepupae carrying the heat shock promoter-ftz-f1 cdna fusion gene construct. transgenic fly lines having the 0.8-kb region of the edg84a promoter fused to lacz expressed the reporter gene in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. base substitutions in the ftz-f1 binding site within the 0.8-kb promoter abolished expression of lacz. these results strongly suggest that the edg84a gene is a direct target of ftz-f1. deletion studies of the cis-regulatory region of the edg84a gene revealed that space-specific expression in imaginal disc-derived epidermis is controlled by the region between bp -408 and -104 from the transcription start site. the region between bp -408 and -194 is necessary to repress expression in a posterior part of the body, while the region between bp -193 and -104 carries a positive element for activation in an anterior part of the body. these results suggest that ftz-f1 governs expression of the edg84a gene in conjunction with putative tissue-specific regulators.

the product of the reaper (rpr) gene is required for programmed cell death in drosophila. we examined rpr expression during ectopic cell deaths caused by ionizing radiation or aberrant development. in both instances, dramatic induction of rpr expression was observed. a genomic fragment upstream of rpr confers this regulatory behavior upon a lacz reporter transgene. in a model cell culture system, conditional expression of reaper is sufficient to induce massive apoptosis that can be prevented by the anti-apoptotic protein p35. overall, these results suggest that diverse signals converge at, or upstream of, rpr-associated transcriptional regulatory elements that can function to initiate a common apoptotic pathway involving ice-like protease activity.

the drosophila teashirt (tsh) gene has an homeotic function which, in combination with hom-c genes, determines thoracic and abdominal (trunk) identities. analysis of tsh protein distribution during embryogenesis using a specific polyclonal antibody shows that it is nuclear. the protein is present with regional modulation in several tissues within the trunk, suggesting additional tsh functions to those already studied. we identified a candidate tsh target shared with some hom-c genes, the modifier of variegation gene modulo (mod). the tsh zinc-finger protein recognizes in vitro two specific sites within a 5' control element of the mod gene which responds in vivo to tsh activity. tsh is therefore a dna binding protein and might directly control mod expression.

the dre/dref system plays an important role in transcription of dna replication genes such as those encoding the 180 and 73 kda subunits of dna polymerase alpha as well as that for encoding pcna. in this study, we found two sequences homologous to dre (5'-tatcgata-3') in the 5'-flanking region (-370 to -357 with respect to the transcription initiation site) of the d-raf gene and confirmed transcriptional activity through gel mobility shift assays, transient cat assays, and spatial patterns of lacz expression in transgenic larval tissues carrying d-raf and lacz fusion genes. further, we demonstrated that the d-raf gene is another target of the zerknüllt (zen) protein with observation of d-raf repression by zen protein in cultured cells and its ectopic expression in the dorsal region of the homozygous zen mutant embryo. the evidence of dre/dref involvement in regulation of the d-raf gene obtained in this study strongly supports the idea that the dre/dref system is responsible for the coordinated regulation of cell proliferation-related genes in drosophila.

the nk-type homeobox gene tinman and the mads box gene d-mef2 encode transcription factors required for the development and differentiation of the drosophila heart, and closely related genes regulate cardiogenesis in vertebrates. genetic analyses indicate that tinman and d-mef2 act at early and late steps, respectively, in the cardiogenic lineage. however, it is unknown whether regulatory interactions exist between these developmental control genes. we show that d-mef2 expression in the developing drosophila heart requires a novel upstream enhancer containing two tinman binding sites, both of which are essential for enhancer function in cardiac muscle cells. transcriptional activity of this cardiac enhancer is dependent on tinman function, and ectopic tinman expression activates the enhancer outside the cardiac lineage. these results define the only known in vivo target for transcriptional activation by tinman and demonstrate that d-mef2 lies directly downstream of tinman in the genetic cascade controlling heart formation in drosophila.

the fushi tarazu pair-rule gene is required for the formation of alternating parasegmental boundaries in the drosophila embryo. fushi tarazu encodes a homeodomain protein necessary for transcription of the engrailed gene in even-numbered parasegments. here we report that, within an engrailed enhancer, adjacent and conserved binding sites for the fushi tarazu protein and a cofactor are each necessary, and together sufficient, for transcriptional activation. footprinting shows that the cofactor site can be bound specifically by ftz-f1, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. ftz-f1 and the fushi tarazu homeodomain bind the sites with 4- to 8-fold cooperativity, suggesting that direct contact between the two proteins may contribute to target recognition. even parasegmental reporter expression is dependent on fushi tarazu and maternal ftz-f1, suggesting that these two proteins are indeed the factors that act upon the two sites in embryos. the two adjacent binding sites are also required for continued activity of the engrailed enhancer after fushi tarazu protein is no longer detectable, including the period when engrailed, and the enhancer, become dependent upon wingless. we also report the existence of a separate negative regulatory element that apparently responds to odd-skipped.

in drosophila, two tgf-beta growth factors, dpp and screw, function synergistically to subdivide the dorsal ectoderm into two embryonic tissues, the amnioserosa and dorsal epidermis. previous studies have shown that peak dpp activity is required for the localized expression of zerknüllt (zen), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. we present evidence that zen directly activates the amnioserosa-specific expression of a downstream target gene, race (related to angiotensin converting enzyme). a 533 bp enhancer from the race promoter region is shown to mediate selective expression in the amnioserosa, as well as the anterior and posterior midgut rudiments. this enhancer contains three zen protein binding sites, and mutations in these sites virtually abolish the expression of an otherwise normal race-lacz fusion gene in the amnioserosa, but not in the gut. genetic epistasis experiments suggest that zen is not the sole activator of race, although a hyperactivated form of zen (a zen-vp16 fusion protein) can partially complement reduced levels of dpp activity. these results suggest that dpp regulates multiple transcription factors, which function synergistically to specify the amnioserosa.

background: primary neurogenesis in the central nervous system of insects and vertebrates occurs in three dorsoventral domains in each side of the neuroectoderm. among the three dorsoventral domains of the drosophila neuroectoderm, the medial and lateral columns express the zinc-finger gene escargot (esg), whereas the intermediate column does not. we studied esg expression as a probe to investigate the mechanism of neuroectoderm patterning. results: the effect of dorsoventral patterning genes on esg expression was studied. decapentaplegic, snail and twist were found to repress esg expression outside the neuroectoderm. the expression of esg in the intermediate column is normally repressed, but was de-repressed when the egf receptor homologue (der) activity was either elevated or reduced. a neurogenic enhancer of esg was identified, and was shown to be separable into a distal region that promotes ubiquitous expression in the neuroectoderm and a proximal region that represses the intermediate expression. conclusions: decapentaplegic, snail, twist and an activator act through the distal region to initiate transcription of esg in the neuroectoderm. we propose that the combination of opposing gradients of der and its ligand creates a peak of der activity in the intermediate column where der represses esg transcription through the proximal repressor region. these two kinds of regulation establish the early esg expression that prefigures the neuroectoderm patterning.

we have isolated the drosophila homolog of the vertebrate islet-1 and islet-2 genes, two members of the lim homeodomain family implicated in the transcriptional control of motor neuronal differentiation. similar to vertebrates, drosophila islet is expressed in a discrete subset of embryonic motor neurons and interneurons that includes the dopaminergic and serotonergic cells of the ventral nerve cord. in contrast to mouse where mutation of islet-1 leads to loss of neurons due to programmed cell death, drosophila islet is not required for neuron survival. instead, loss of islet function causes defects in axon pathfinding and targeting plus loss of dopamine and serotonin synthesis. ectopic expression of islet induces both specific alterations in pathfinding and changes in neurotransmitter identity. these findings indicate that islet coordinately controls two distinct aspects of neuronal identity.

hedgehog (hh) is a member of a family of secreted proteins that direct patterning at multiple stages in both drosophila and vertebrate development. during drosophila embryogenesis, hh protein is secreted by the cells of the posterior compartment of each segment. hh activates transcription of wingless (wg), gooseberry (gsb), and patched (ptc) in the cells immediately adjacent to hh-secreting cells. hh signaling is thought to involve the segment polarity gene cubitus interruptus (ci). ci encodes a zinc finger protein of the gli family of sequence-specific dna binding proteins. ci mrna is expressed in all non-hh expressing cells. here we demonstrate ci activity is both necessary and sufficient to drive expression of hh-responsive genes in the drosophila embryos. we show that ci is a sequence-specific dna binding protein that drives transcription from the wg promoter in transiently transfected cells. we demonstrate that ci binding sites in the wg promoter are necessary for this transcriptional activation. these data taken together provide strong evidence that ci is a transcriptional effector of hh signaling.

the drosophila vitelline membrane protein gene vm32e is expressed according to a precise temporal and spatial program in the follicle cells. results from germ line transformation experiments using different fragments of the -465/-39 vm32e region fused to the hsp/lacz reporter gene revealed that the region -348/-39 is sufficient to confer the wild-type expression pattern. within this segment, distinct cis-regulatory elements control vm32e expression in ventral and dorsal follicle cells. the region between -135/-113 is essential for expression of the vm32e gene in the ventral columnar follicle cells. expression in the dorsal domain requires the two regions -348/-254 and -118/-39. furthermore, the region -253/-119 appears to contain a negative element that represses gene activity in anterior centripetal cells. we suggest that the expression of the vm32e gene throughout the follicular epithelium is controlled by specific cis-regulatory elements acting in distinct spatial domains and following a precise developmental program.

decapentaplegic (dpp) is an extracellular signal of the transforming growth factor-beta family with multiple functions during drosophila development. for example, it plays a key role in the embryo during endoderm induction. during this process, dpp stimulates transcription of the homeotic genes ultrabithorax in the visceral mesoderm and labial in the subjacent endoderm. here, we show that a camp response element (cre) from an ultrabithorax enhancer mediates dpp-responsive transcription in the embryonic midgut, and that endoderm expression from a labial enhancer depends on multiple cres. furthermore, the drosophila cre-binding protein dcreb-b binds to the ultrabithorax cre, and ubiquitous expression of a dominant-negative form of dcreb-b suppresses cre-mediated reporter gene expression and reduces labial expression in the endoderm. therefore, a creb protein may act as a nuclear target, or as a partner of a nuclear target, for dpp signalling in the embryonic midgut.

genes expressed under circadian-clock control are found in organisms ranging from prokaryotes to humans. in drosophila melanogaster, the period (per) gene, which is required for clock function, is transcribed in a circadian manner. we have identified a circadian transcriptional enhancer within a 69-bp dna fragment upstream of the per gene. this enhancer drives high-amplitude mrna cycling under light-dark-cycling or constant-dark conditions, and this activity is per protein (per) dependent. an e-box sequence within this 69-bp fragment is necessary for high-level expression, but not for rhythmic expression, indicating that per mediates circadian transcription through other sequences in this fragment.

nk-4, also called msh2 and tinman, encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that is required for the development of the dorsal mesoderm and its derivatives in the drosophila embryo. genetic analyses indicate that nk-4 resides downstream of the mesodermal determinant twist, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor. however, the regulation of nk-4 by twist remains poorly understood. using expression assays in cultured cells and transgenic flies, we show that two distinct clusters of e-box regulatory sequences, present upstream of the nk-4 gene, mediate nk-4 expression in the visceral mesoderm. these elements are conserved between the drosophila melanogaster and drosophila virilis nk-4 genes and serve as binding sites for twist (e1 cluster) and nk-4 (e2 cluster) proteins. in cultured cells, twist and nk-4 binding results in activation of nk-4 gene expression. in transgenic animals, the e1 and e2 clusters are functionally connected, and both elements are required for nk-4 activation in cells of the visceral mesoderm and also for nk-4 repression in cells of the somatic musculature. these results demonstrate that nk-4 is a direct transcriptional target for twist and its own gene product in visceral mesodermal cells, supporting the idea that twist and nk-4 function in the subdivision of the mesoderm during drosophila embryogenesis.

the regulatory regions of homologous genes encoding esterase 6 (est-6) of drosophila melanogaster and esterase 5b (est-5b) of drosophila pseudoobscura show very little similarity. we have undertaken a comparative study of the pattern of expression directed by the est-5b and est-6 5'-flanking dna to attempt to reveal conserved elements regulating tissue-specific expression in adults. esterase regulatory sequences were linked to a lacz reporter gene and transformed into d. melanogaster embryos. est-5b, 5' upstream elements, give rise to a beta-galactosidase expression pattern that coincides with the wild-type expression of est-5b in d. pseudoobscura. the expression patterns of the est-5b/lacz construct are different from those of a fusion gene containing the upstream region of est-6. common sites of expression for both kinds of constructs are the third segment of antenna, the maxillary palps, and salivary glands. in vitro deletion mutagenesis has shown that the two genes have a different organization of regulatory elements controlling expression in both the third segment of antenna and maxillary palps. the results suggest that the conservation of the expression pattern in genes that evolved from a common ancestor may not be accompanied by preservation of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements.

we identified and characterized the don juan gene (dj) of drosophila melanogaster. the don juan gene codes for a sperm specific protein component with an unusual repetitive six amino acid motif (dpckkk) in the carboxy-terminal part of the protein. the expression of don juan is limited to male germ cells where transcription of the dj gene is initiated during meiotic prophase. but western blot experiments indicate that dj protein occurs just postmeiotically. examination of transgenic flies bearing a dj-promoter-lacz reporter construct revealed lacz mrna distribution resembling the expression pattern of the endogenous dj mrna in the adult testes, whereas beta-galactosidase expression is exclusively present in postmeiotic germ cells. thus, these observations strongly suggest that dj transcripts are under translational repression until in spermiogenesis. to study the function and subcellular distribution of dj in spermiogenesis we expressed a chimaeric dj-gfp fusion gene in the male germline exhibiting strong gfp fluorescence in the liver testes, where only elongated spermatids are decorated. with regard to the characteristic expression pattern of dj protein and its conspicuous repeat units possible functional roles are discussed.

pair-rule gene hairy (h) expression in seven evenly spaced stripes, along the longitudinal axis of the drosophila blastoderm embryo, is mediated by a modular array of separate stripe enhancer elements. the minimal enhancer element, which generates reporter gene expression in place of the most posterior h stripe 7 (h7-element), contains a dense array of binding sites for factors providing the trans-acting control of h stripe 7 expression as revealed by genetic analyses. the h7-element mediates position-dependent gene expression by sensing region-specific combinations and concentrations of both the maternal homeodomain transcriptional activators, caudal and bicoid, and of transcriptional repressors encoded by locally expressed zygotic gap genes. caudal and bicoid, which form complementing concentration gradients along the longitudinal axis of the embryo, function as redundant activators, indicating that the anterior determinant bicoid is able to activate gene expression in the most posterior region of the embryo. the spatial limits of the h stripe-7 domain are brought about by the local activities of repressors which prevent activation. the results suggest that the gradients of bicoid and caudal combine their activities to activate segmentation genes along the entire axis of the embryo.

krüppel (kr) encodes a zinc finger-type transcription factor expressed in spatially and temporally restricted patterns during drosophila embryogenesis. molecular targets and the mechanism of kr action have been studied extensively during the early segmentation process, but only little is known about kr requirement during later development. we report the identification of a target gene of kr, termed knockout (ko), isolated by virtue of krüppel in vitro binding sites. loss and gain of function experiments show that kr activity maintains ko expression in a subset of muscles. ko encodes a novel protein expressed in several embryonic tissues including kr-expressing muscles. movements of embryos deficient for ko activity are uncoordinated. their muscle pattern is normal, but the patterns of neuromuscular innervation are specifically disarranged. the results suggest that the kr target gene ko is required for proper innervation of specific muscles by rp motoneurons.

tailless encodes a transcription factor expressed in multiple domains in the developing embryo. early and transient expression at the posterior pole is required to establish a domain from which the eighth abdominal segment, telson and posterior gut arise. just a few nuclear cycles later, a brain-specific domain is initiated at the anterior; expression in this domain is maintained with complex modulations throughout embryogenesis. expression of tailless in this domain is required to establish the most anterior region of the brain. to understand the function and regulation of these different domains of expression, we provide a detailed description of tailless expression in brain neuroblasts and show that this expression is not detectably regulated by the head gap genes buttonhead or orthodenticle, by the proneural gene lethal of scute or by tailless itself. we show that approximately 6 kb of sequenced upstream regulatory dna can drive lacz expression in a pattern that mimics the full tailless embryonic expression pattern. within this sequence we identify multiple modules responsible for different aspects of the tailless pattern. in addition to identifying additional torso response elements that mediate early blastoderm polar expression, we show that the complex brain expression pattern is driven by a combination of modules; thus expression at a low level throughout the brain and at a high level in the dorsal medial portion of the brain and in the optic lobe, as well as neuroblast-specific repression are mediated by different dna regions.

grainyhead belongs to a recently identified group of transcription factors which share a 250-amino-acid domain required for binding to dna and a carboxy-terminal dimerization domain. the activities of grainyhead and other members of the family appear to be modulated so that they can participate in different developmental processes. we have examined the structure and function of mrnas from the drosophila grainyhead gene and demonstrated that alternate splicing is responsible for generating a neuroblast-specific isoform of the protein. a mutation which abolishes this isoform results in pupal and adult lethality. reporter genes containing different grainyhead binding sites exhibit tissue-specific patterns of expression that correlate with the grainyhead isoforms, suggesting that the alternate splicing serves to alter the repertoire of target genes controlled in the neuroblasts.

the neuropeptide eclosion hormone (eh) is a key regulator of insect ecdysis. we tested the role of the two eh-producing neurons in drosophila by using an eh cell-specific enhancer to activate cell death genes reaper and head involution defective to ablate the eh cells. in the eh cell knockout flies, larval and adult ecdyses were disrupted, yet a third of the knockouts emerged as adults, demonstrating that eh has a significant but nonessential role in ecdysis. the eh cell knockouts had discrete behavioral deficits, including slow, uncoordinated eclosion and an insensitivity to ecdysis-triggering hormone. the knockouts lacked the lights-on eclosion response despite having a normal circadian eclosion rhythm. this study represents a novel approach to the dissection of neuropeptide regulation of a complex behavioral program.

--------------------

the drosophila tinman homeobox gene has a major role in early mesoderm patterning and determines the formation of visceral mesoderm, heart progenitors, specific somatic muscle precursors and glia-like mesodermal cells. these functions of tinman are reflected in its dynamic pattern of expression, which is characterized by initial widespread expression in the trunk mesoderm, then refinement to a broad dorsal mesodermal domain, and finally restricted expression in heart progenitors. here we show that each of these phases of expression is driven by a discrete enhancer element, the first being active in the early mesoderm, the second in the dorsal mesoderm and the third in cardioblasts. we provide evidence that the early-active enhancer element is a direct target of twist, a gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) protein, which is necessary for tinman activation. this 180 bp enhancer includes three e-box sequences which bind twist protein in vitro and are essential for enhancer activity in vivo. ectodermal misexpression of twist causes ectopic activation of this enhancer in ectodermal cells, indicating that twist is the only mesoderm-specific activator of early tinman expression. we further show that the 180 bp enhancer also includes negatively acting sequences. binding of even-skipped to these sequences appears to reduce twist-dependent activation in a periodic fashion, thus producing a striped tinman pattern in the early mesoderm. in addition, these sequences prevent activation of tinman by twist in a defined portion of the head mesoderm that gives rise to hemocytes. we find that this repression requires the function of buttonhead, a head-patterning gene, and that buttonhead is necessary for normal activation of the hematopoietic differentiation gene serpent in the same area. together, our results show that tinman is controlled by an array of discrete enhancer elements that are activated successively by differential genetic inputs, as well as by closely linked activator and repressor binding sites within an early-acting enhancer, which restrict twist activity to specific areas within the twist expression domain.

the development of drosophila trachea is under the control of spatially and/or quantitatively regulated activity of breathless fgf receptor, which is also essential for midline glial migration. here, we identified the minimum enhancer region of breathless, cloned the drosophila arnt gene (darnt), and showed biochemical and genetic evidence that breathless expression in developing trachea is regulated by direct interactions between trachealess/darnt heterodimers and three central midline elements (tacgtgs) situated in the minimum enhancer region. our results also showed that single-minded/darnt heterodimers, which are essential for breathless expression in midline precursor cells, share dna targets in common with trachealess/darnt, indicating that two different basic helix-loop-helix-pas protein complexes act through the same target sites in vivo.

the region-specific homeotic gene spalt is involved in the specification of terminal versus trunk structures during early drosophila embryogenesis. later in development spalt activity participates in specific processes during organogenesis and larval imaginal disc development. the multiple functions of spalt are reflected in distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns throughout development. here we show that spalt cis-regulatory sequences for region-specific and organ-specific expression are clustered. their organization may provide the structural basis for the diversification of expression pattern within the spalt/spalt related/spalt adjacent gene complex. we also examined the transacting factor requirement for the blastodermal spalt expression domains. they are under the genetic control of maternal and gap gene products and we show that these products are able to bind to corresponding spalt cis-acting sequences in vitro. the results suggest that the transacting factors, as defined by genetic studies, functionally interact with the spalt regulatory region. in addition, we provide evidence that a zygotic gene product of the terminal system, tailless, cooperates with the maternal gene product caudal and thereby activates gene expression in the terminal region of the embryo.

the homeotic proteins encoded by the genes of the drosophila hom and the vertebrate hox complexes do not bind divergent dna sequences with a high selectivity. in vitro, hom (hox) specificity can be increased by the formation of heterodimers with extradenticle (exd) or pbx homeodomain proteins. we have identified a single essential labial (lab)/exd-binding site in a decapentaplegic (dpp)-responsive enhancer of the homeotic gene lab which drives expression in the developing midgut. we show that lab and exd bind cooperatively to the site in vitro, and that the expression of the enhancer in vivo requires exd and lab function. in addition, point mutations in either the exd or the lab subsite compromise enhancer function, strongly suggesting that exd and lab bind to this site in vivo. interestingly, we found that the activity of the enhancer is only stimulated by dpp signaling significantly upon binding of lab and exd. thus, the enhancer appears to integrate positional information via the homeotic gene lab, and spatiotemporal information via dpp signaling; only when these inputs act in concert in an endodermal cell is the enhancer fully active. our results illustrate how a tissue-specific response to dpp can be generated through synergistic effects on an enhancer carrying both dpp- and hox-responsive sequences.

in vertebrates, transcriptional control of skeletal muscle genes during differentiation is regulated by enhancers that direct the combinatorial binding and/or interaction of mef2 and the bhlh myod family of myogenic factors. we have shown that drosophila mef2 plays a role similar to its vertebrate counterpart in the regulation of the tropomyosin i gene in the development of drosophila somatic muscles, however, unlike vertebrates, drosophila mef2 interacts with a muscle activator region that does not have binding sites for myogenic bhlh-like factors or any other known drosophila transcription factors. we describe here the isolation and characterization of a component of the muscle activator region that we have named pdp1 (par domain protein 1). pdp1 is a novel transcription factor that is highly homologous to the par subfamily of mammalian bzip transcription factors hlf, dbp and vbp/tef. this is the first member of the par subfamily of bzip transcription factors to be identified in drosophila. we show that pdp1 is involved in regulating expression of the tropomyosin i gene in somatic body-wall and pharyngeal muscles by binding to dna sequences within the muscle activator that are required for activator function. mutations that eliminate pdp1 binding eliminate muscle activator function and severely reduce expression of a muscle activator plus mef2 mini-enhancer. these and previous results suggest that pdp1 may function as part of a larger protein/dna complex that interacts with mef2 to regulate transcription of drosophila muscle genes. furthermore, in addition to being expressed in the mesoderm that gives rise to the somatic muscles, pdp1 is also expressed in the mesodermal fat body, the developing midgut endoderm, the hindgut and malpighian tubules, and the epidermis and central nervous system, suggesting that pdp1 is also involved in the terminal differentiation of these tissues.

circadian oscillations in period (per) mrna and per protein (per) constitute, in part, a feedback loop that is required for circadian pacemaker function in drosophila melanogaster. oscillations in per are required for oscillations in per mrna, but the converse has not been rigorously tested because of a lack of measurable quantities of per mrna and protein in the same cells. this circadian feedback loop operates synchronously in many neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, including a set of lateral brain neurons (lns) that mediate rhythms in locomotor activity, but whether a hierarchy among these tissues maintains this synchrony is not known. to determine whether per mrna cycling is necessary for per cycling and whether cyclic per gene expression is tissue autonomous, we have generated per01 flies carrying a transgene that constitutively expresses per mrna specifically in photoreceptors, a cell type that supports feedback loop function. these transformants were tested for different aspects of feedback loop function including per mrna cycling, per cycling, and per nuclear localization. under both light/dark (ld) cycling and constant dark (dd) conditions, per abundance cycles in the absence of circadian cycling of per mrna. these results show that per mrna cycling is not required for per cycling and indicate that drosophila photoreceptors r1-r6 contain a tissue autonomous circadian oscillator.

sperm tail proteins that are components of a specific structure formed late during spermatid elongation have been found to be encoded by the mst(3)cgp gene family. these genes have been demonstrated to be regulated both at the transcriptional as well as at the translational level. we report here on the dissection of the regulatory regions for two members of the gene family, mst84da and mst84db. while high level transcription and negative translational control of mst84da is mediated by a short gene segment of 205 nt (-152/+53), mst84db expression is controlled by a number of distinct regulatory elements with different effects that all reside within the gene itself. we identify a transcriptional control element between +154 and +216, a translational repression element around +216 to +275 and an rna stability element within the 3'utr. irrespective of the final common expression characteristics, correct regulation for any individual member of the gene family seems to be achieved by very different means. this confirms earlier observations that did not detect any other sequence elements in common apart from the tce (translational control element).

the segment polarity gene cubitus interruptus (ci) encodes a transcriptional effector of hedgehog (hh) signaling in drosophila. the ci gene product is a zinc finger protein belonging to the gli family of sequence-specific dna binding proteins. after gastrulation, segmental expression of the segment polarity gene wingless (wg) is maintained by hh signaling in a pathway requiring ci activity. in the absence of hh or ci activity, wg expression is initiated normally and then fades in the ectoderm after stage 10. we have previously identified a wingless enhancer region whose ci binding sites mediate ci-dependent transcriptional activation in transiently transfected cells. here we demonstrate that hh and patched (ptc) act through those ci binding sites to modulate the level of ci-dependent transcriptional activation in s2 cells. we demonstrate that this same wg enhancer region is hh responsive in vivo and that its ci binding sites are necessary for its activity. this provides strong evidence that hh affects wg transcription through post-translational activation of ci.

the drosophila melanogaster gene teashirt (tsh) is essential for segment identity of the embryonic thorax and abdomen. a deletion 3' to the tsh transcription unit causes the loss of tsh early expression in the even-numbered parasegments, and the corresponding larval cuticular patterns are disrupted. tsh function in the odd-numbered parasegments in these mutants is normal by both criteria. the in vivo activities of genomic fragments from the deleted region were tested in transgenic embryos. a 2.0 kb enhancer from the 3' region acts mainly in the even-numbered parasegments and is dependent on fushi tarazu (ftz) activity, which encodes a homeodomain protein required for the development of even-numbered parasegments. ftz protein binds in vitro to four distinct sequences in a 220 bp sub-fragment; these and neighboring sequences are conserved in the equivalent enhancer isolated from drosophila virilis. tsh protein produced under the control of the 220 bp enhancer partially rescues a null tsh mutation, with its strongest effect in the even-numbered parasegments. mutation of the ftz binding sites partially abrogates the capacity for rescue. these results suggest a composite mechanism for regulation of tsh, with different activators such as ftz contributing to the overall pattern of expression of this key regulator.

mef2 is a mads-box transcription factor required for muscle development in drosophila. here, we show that the bhlh transcription factor twist directly regulates mef2 expression in adult somatic muscle precursor cells via a 175-bp enhancer located 2245 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. within this element, a single evolutionarily conserved e box is essential for enhancer activity. twist protein can bind to this e box to activate mef2 transcription, and ectopic expression of twist results in ectopic activation of the wild-type 175-bp enhancer. by use of a temperature-sensitive mutant of twist, we show that activation of mef2 transcription via this enhancer by twist is required for normal adult muscle development, and reduction in twist function results in phenotypes similar to those observed previously in mef2 mutant adults. the 175-bp enhancer is also active in the embryonic mesoderm, indicating that this enhancer functions at multiple times during development, and its function is dependent on the same conserved e box. in embryos, a reduction in twist function also strongly reduced mef2 expression. these findings define a novel transcriptional pathway required for skeletal muscle development and identify twist as an essential and direct regulator of mef2 expression in the somatic mesoderm.

in drosophila, peaks of the titer of the steroid hormone ecdysone act as molecular signals that trigger all the major developmental transitions occurring along the life cycle. the ecr/usp heterodimer, known to constitute the functional ecdysone receptor, binds with high affinity to specific target sequences, the ecdysone response elements (ecres), whose repertoire still remains to be fully characterized at both the molecular and functional levels. in order to investigate the properties of ecres composed of directly repeated half-sites (drs), we have analysed the binding properties of the ng-ecre, a dr element located within the coding region of ng-1 and ng-2, two highly homologous genes mapping at the ecdysone-regulated 3c intermolt puff. we report here that the ng-ecre contacts the ecdysone receptor through its directly repeated half-sites spaced by 12 bp, and that this element may interact efficiently with at least three drosophila orphan receptors, namely dhr38, dhr39 and beta ftz-f1. interestingly, dhr38 is bound alone or in combination with usp, providing the first evidence that the ecr-usp and dhr38-usp may directly compete for binding to a common response element. these results suggest that ecres composed of widely spaced drs may contribute to the establishment of extensive nuclear receptors cross-talking along the development, a mechanism that might play a relevant role in determining the temporal and spatial specificity of the ecdysone response. finally, we show that the ng-ecre can promote functional interactions in vitro as well as in vivo, acting as a transcriptional enhancer able to confer a specific developmental expression profile to a minimal promoter in transgenic flies.

a hallmark of the systemic antimicrobial response of drosophila is the synthesis by the fat body of several antimicrobial peptides which are released into the hemolymph in response to a septic injury. one of these peptides, drosomycin, is active primarily against fungi. using a drosomycin-green fluorescent protein (gfp) reporter gene, we now show that in addition to the fat body, a variety of epithelial tissues that are in direct contact with the external environment, including those of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts, can express the antifungal peptide, suggesting a local response to infections affecting these barrier tissues. as is the case for vertebrate epithelia, insect epithelia appear to be more than passive physical barriers and are likely to constitute an active component of innate immunity. we also show that, in contrast to the systemic antifungal response, this local immune response is independent of the toll pathway.

homeobox genes encode a class of highly evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that control embryonic development. the drosophila melanogaster empty spiracles gene is the homolog of the two human homeobox genes emx1 and emx2. these genes are necessary for central nervous system development. we used a regulatory element of the empty spiracles gene to study the control of homeobox gene expression. the 1.2-kilobase (kb) cis-regulatory element located 3 kb 5' of the transcription start site of the empty spiracles gene was analyzed by evolutionary sequence comparisons, gel mobility shift assays, dnase footprinting, and the generation of transgenic flies. the corresponding element from a related species, drosophila hydei, was cloned. three discrete, approximately 100 base pair (bp) regions of sequence homology were identified. each had two blocks of 10 to 40 bp of near perfect sequence identity. fusion proteins were produced containing the abdominal-b homeodomain or the empty spiracles homeodomain, known regulators of empty spiracles gene expression. gel mobility shift assays showed that each of the three regions is bound by both proteins. dnase footprinting revealed closely linked empty spiracles and abdominal-b binding sites. we then generated transgenic flies containing a reporter linked to individual conserved regions of the enhancer. reporter expression was evident only outside of the usual empty spiracles expression domain. these elements are not sufficient alone; a combinatorial model is proposed. conserved discrete areas within a homeobox gene regulatory element, which function as homeodomain protein transcription factor binding sites, are used in a combinatorial fashion to regulate these developmentally important genes.

patterning of the drosophila embryo depends on the accurate expression of wingless (wg), which encodes a secreted signal required for segmentation and many other processes. early expression of wg is regulated by the nuclear proteins of the gap and pair-rule gene classes but, after gastrulation, wg transcription is also dependent on cell-cell communication. signaling to the wg-producing cells is mediated by the secreted protein, hedgehog (hh), and by cubitus interruptus (ci), a transcriptional effector of the hh signal transduction pathway. the transmembrane protein patched (ptc) acts as a negative regulator of wg expression; ptc- embryos have ectopic wg expression. according to the current models, ptc is a receptor for hh. the default activity of ptc is to inhibit ci function; when ptc binds hh, this inhibition is released and ci can control wg transcription. we have investigated cis-acting sequences that regulate wg during the time that wg expression depends on hh signaling. we show that approximately 4.5 kb immediately upstream of the wg transcription unit can direct expression of the reporter gene lacz in domains similar to the normal wg pattern in the embryonic ectoderm. expression of this reporter construct expands in ptc mutants and responds to hh activity. within this 4.5 kb, a 150 bp element, highly conserved between d. melanogaster and drosophila virilis, is required to spatially restrict wg transcription. activity of this element depends on ptc, but it contains no consensus ci-binding sites. the discovery of an element that is likely to bind a transcriptional repressor was unexpected, since the prevailing model suggests that wg expression is principally controlled by hh signaling acting through the ci activator. we show that wg regulatory dna can drive lacz in a proper wg-like pattern without any conserved ci-binding sites and suggest that ci can not be the sole endpoint of the hh pathway.

the drosophila pax-6 gene eyeless acts high up in the genetic hierarchy involved in compound eye development and can direct the formation of extra eyes in ectopic locations. here we identify sine oculis and eyes absent as two mediators of the eye-inducing activity of eyeless. we show that eyeless induces and requires the expression of both genes independently during extra eye development. during normal eye development, eyeless is expressed earlier than and is required for the expression of sine oculis and eyes absent, but not vice versa. based on the results presented here and those of others, we propose a model in which eyeless induces the initial expression of both sine oculis and eyes absent in the eye disc. sine oculis and eyes absent then appear to participate in a positive feedback loop that regulates the expression of all three genes. in contrast to the regulatory interactions that occur in the developing eye disc, we also show that in the embryonic head, sine oculis acts in parallel to eyeless and twin of eyeless, a second pax-6 gene from drosophila. recent studies in vertebrate systems indicate that the epistatic relationships among the corresponding vertebrate homologs are very similar to those observed in drosophila.

the circadian oscillator generates a rhythmic output with a period of about 24 hours. despite extensive studies in several model systems, the biochemical mode of action has not yet been demonstrated for any of its components. here, the drosophila clock protein was shown to induce transcription of the circadian rhythm genes period and timeless. dclock functioned as a heterodimer with a drosophila homolog of bmal1. these proteins acted through an e-box sequence in the period promoter. the timeless promoter contains an 18-base pair element encompassing an e-box, which was sufficient to confer dclock responsiveness to a reporter gene. period and timeless proteins blocked dclock's ability to transactivate their promoters via the e-box. thus, dclock drives expression of period and timeless, which in turn inhibit dclock's activity and close the circadian loop.

to learn about the acquisition of neural fate by ectodermal cells, we have analyzed a very early sign of neural commitment in drosophila, namely the specific accumulation of achaete-scute complex (as-c) proneural proteins in the cell that becomes a sensory organ mother cell (smc). we have characterized an as-c enhancer that directs expression specifically in smcs. this enhancer promotes scute protein accumulation in these cells, an event essential for sensory organ development in the absence of other as-c genes. interspecific sequence comparisons and site-directed mutagenesis show the presence of several conserved motifs necessary for enhancer action, some of them binding sites for proneural proteins. these and other data indicate that the enhancer mediates scute self-stimulation, although only in the presence of additional activating factors, which most likely interact with conserved motifs reminiscent of nf-kappab-binding sites. cells neighboring the smc do not acquire the neural fate because the notch signaling pathway effectors, the enhancer of split bhlh proteins, block this proneural gene self-stimulatory loop, possibly by antagonizing the action on the enhancer of the nf-kappab-like factors or the proneural proteins. these data suggest a mechanism for smc committment.

the number and pattern of neuroblasts that initially segregate from the neuroectoderm in the early drosophila embryo is identical in thoracic and abdominal segments. however, during late embryogenesis differences in the numbers of neuroblasts and in the extent of neuroblast proliferation arise between these regions. we show that the homeotic genes ultrabithorax and abdominal-a regulate these late differences, and that misexpression of either gene in thoracic neuroblasts after segregation is sufficient to induce abdominal behaviour. however, in wild type embryos we only detect abdominal-a and ultrabithorax proteins in early neuroblasts. furthermore, transplantation experiments reveal that segment-specific behaviour is determined prior to neuroblast segregation. thus, the segment-specific differences in neuroblast behaviour seem to be determined in the early embryo, mediated through the expression of homeotic genes in early neuroblasts, and executed in later programmes controlling neuroblast numbers and proliferation.

the beta 3 tubulin gene (beta tub60d) is a structural gene expressed during mesoderm development from the extended germ band stage onward. expression within the individual mesodermal derivatives is guided by different control elements. the upstream regions allow expression in the dorsal vessel and the somatic mesoderm while enhancers localized in the first intron guide expression in the visceral mesoderm. deletion analysis carried out in transgenic flies revealed independent regulatory elements for the dorsal vessel and the somatic mesoderm. for expression in the somatic mesoderm, a 279-bp region is absolutely essential. this region contains a binding site for the drosophila myocyte-specific enhancer binding factor 2 (d-mef2), a mads-box transcription factor known to be essential for mesoderm development. deletion or mutation of this d-mef2 binding site strongly reduces transcription. this pattern is consistent with the strongly reduced expression of beta 3 tubulin in d-mef2 mutant embryos. this analysis furthermore reveals that the d-mef2 binding site acts in concert with nearby cis regulatory elements. these data show that the upstream control region of the beta 3 tubulin gene is an early target of the d-mef2 transcriptional activator.

dorsal mesoderm induction in arthropods and ventral mesoderm induction in vertebrates are closely related processes that involve signals of the bmp family. in drosophila, induction of visceral mesoderm, dorsal muscles, and the heart by dpp is, at least in part, effected through the transcriptional activation and function of the homeobox gene tinman in dorsal mesodermal cells during early embryogenesis. here we present a functional dissection of a tinman enhancer that mediates the dpp response. we provide evidence that mesoderm-specific induction of tinman requires the binding of both activators and repressors. screens for binding factors yielded tinman itself and the smad4 homolog medea. we show that the binding and synergistic activities of smad and tinman proteins are critical for mesodermal tinman induction, whereas repressor binding sites prevent induction in the dorsal ectoderm and amnioserosa. thus, integration of positive and negative regulators on enhancers of target genes appears to be an important mechanism in tissue-specific induction by tgf-beta molecules.

atonal is a proneural gene for the development of drosophila chordotonal organs and photoreceptor cells. we show here that atonal expression is controlled by modular enhancer elements located 5' or 3' to the atonal-coding sequences. during chordotonal organ development, the 3' enhancer directs expression in proneural clusters; whereas successive modular enhancers located in the 5' region drive tissue-specific expression in chordotonal organ precursors in the embryo and larval leg, wing and antennal imaginal discs. similarly, in the eye disc, the 3' enhancer directs initial expression in a stripe anterior to the morphogenetic furrow. these atonal-expressing cells are then patterned through a notch-dependent process into initial clusters, representing the earliest patterning event yet identified during eye morphogenesis. a distinct 5' enhancer drives expression in intermediate groups and r8 cells within and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow. both enhancers are required for normal atonal function in the eye. the 5' enhancer, but not the 3' enhancer, depends on endogenous atonal function, suggesting a switch from regulation directed by other upstream genes to atonal autoregulation during the process of lateral inhibition. the regulatory regions identified in this study can thus account for atonal expression in every tissue and essentially in every stage of its expression during chordotonal organ and photoreceptor development.

the drosophila gene serrate encodes a membrane spanning protein, which is expressed in a complex pattern during embryogenesis and larval stages. loss of serrate function leads to larval lethality, which is associated with several morphogenetic defects, including the failure to develop wings and halteres. serrate has been suggested to act as a short-range signal during wing development. it is required for the induction of the organising centre at the dorsal/ventral compartment boundary, from which growth and patterning of the wing is controlled. in order to understand the regulatory network required to control the spatially and temporally dynamic expression of serrate, we analysed its cis-regulatory elements by fusing various genomic fragments upstream of the reporter gene lacz. enhancer elements reflecting the expression pattern of endogenous serrate in embryonic and postembryonic tissues could be confined to 26 kb of genomic dna, including 9 kb of transcribed region. expression in some embryonic tissues is under the control of multiple enhancers located in the 5' region and in intron sequences. the data presented here provide the tools to unravel the genetic network which regulates serrate during different developmental stages in diverse tissues.

the drosophila mef2 gene encodes a mads domain transcription factor required for the differentiation of cardiac, somatic, and visceral muscles during embryogenesis and the patterning of adult indirect flight muscles assembled during metamorphosis. a prerequisite for d-mef2 function in myogenesis is its precise expression in multiple cell types during development. novel enhancers for d-mef2 transcription in cardiac and adult muscle precursor cells have been identified and their regulation by the tinman and twist myogenic factors have been demonstrated. however, these results suggested the existence of additional regulators and provided limited information on the specification of progenitor cells for different muscle lineages. we have further characterized the heart enhancer and show it is part of a complex regulatory region controlling the activation and repression of d-mef2 transcription in several cell types. the mutation of a gata sequence in the enhancer changes its specificity from cardial to pericardial cells. also, the addition of flanking sequences to the heart enhancer results in expression in a new cell type, that being the founder cells of a subset of body wall muscles. as tinman function is required for d-mef2 expression in both the cardial and founder cells, these results define a shared regulatory dna that functions in distinct lineages due to the combinatorial activity of tinman and other factors that work through adjacent sequences. the analysis of d-mef2-lacz fusion genes in mutant embryos revealed that the specification of the muscle precursor cells involved the wingless gene and the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.

two mrna species were observed for the drosophila e2f (de2f) gene, differing with regard to the first exons (exon 1-a and exon 1-b), which were expressed differently during development. a single transcription initiation site for mrna containing exon 1-b was mapped by primer extension analysis and numbered +1. we found three tandemly aligned sequences, similar to the dna replication-related element (dre; 5'-tatcgata), which is commonly required for transcription of genes related to dna replication and cell proliferation, in the region upstream of this site. band mobility shift analyses using oligonucleotides containing the dre-related sequences with or without various base substitutions revealed that two out of three dre-related sequences are especially important for binding to the dre-binding factor (dref). on footprinting analysis with kc cell nuclear extracts and a glutathione s-transferase fusion protein with the n-terminal fragment (1-125 amino acid residues) of dref, all three dre-related sequences were found to be protected. transient luciferase expression assays in kc cells demonstrated that the region containing the three dre-related sequences is required for high promoter activity. we have established transgenic lines of drosophila in which ectopic expression of dref was targeted to the eye imaginal disc cells. overexpression of dref in eye imaginal disc cells enhanced the promoter activity of de2f. the obtained results indicate that the dre/dref system activates transcription of the de2f gene.

the bicoid (bcd) morphogen establishes the head and thorax of the drosophila embryo. bcd activates the transcription of identified target genes in the thoracic segments, but its mechanism of action in the head remains poorly understood. it has been proposed that bcd directly activates the cephalic gap genes, which are the first zygotic genes to be expressed in the head primordium. it has also been suggested that the affinity of bcd-binding sites in the promoters of bcd target genes determines the posterior extent of their expression (the gene x model). however, both these hypotheses remain untested. here, we show that a small regulatory region upstream of the cephalic gap gene orthodenticle (otd) is sufficient to recapitulate early otd expression in the head primordium. this region contains two control elements, each capable of driving otd-like expression. the first element has consensus bcd target sites that bind bcd in vitro and are necessary for head-specific expression. as predicted by the gene x model, this element has a relatively low affinity for bcd. surprisingly, the second regulatory element has no bcd sites. instead, it contains a repeated sequence motif similar to a regulatory element found in the promoters of otd-related genes in vertebrates. our study is the first demonstration that a cephalic gap gene is directly regulated by bcd. however, it also shows that zygotic gene expression can be targeted to the head primordium without direct bcd regulation.

cell proliferation in the excretory organs of drosophila, the malpighian tubules (mt), is under the control of a neural tip cell. this unique cell is singled out from equivalent mt primordial cells in response to notch signalling. we show that the gene krüppel (kr), best known for its segmentation function in the early embryo, is under the control of the notch-dependent signalling process. lack-of-function and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that kr activity determines the neural fate of tip cells by acting as a direct downstream target of proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) proteins that are restricted in response to notch signalling. we have identified a unique cis-acting element that mediates all spatial and temporal aspects of kr gene expression during mt development. this element contains functional binding sites for the restricted proneural bhlh factors and fork head protein which is expressed in all mt cells. our results suggest a mechanism in which these transcription factors cooperate to set up a unique cell fate within an equivalence group of cells by restricting the activity of the developmental switch gene kr in response to notch signalling.

the legs of drosophila are divided into segments along the proximodistal axis by flexible structures called joints. the separation between segments is already visible in the imaginal disc as folds of the epithelium, and cells at segment boundaries have different morphology during pupal development. we find that notch is locally activated in distal cells of each segment, as demonstrated by the restricted expression of the enhancer of split mbeta gene, and is required for the formation of normal joints. the genes fringe, delta, serrate and suppressor of hairless, also participate in notch function during leg development, and their expression is localised within the leg segments with respect to segment boundaries. the failure to form joints when notch signalling is compromised leads to shortened legs, suggesting that the correct specification of segment boundaries is critical for normal leg growth. the requirement for notch during leg development resembles that seen during somite formation in vertebrates and at the dorsal ventral boundary of the wing, suggesting that the creation of boundaries of gene expression through notch activation plays a conserved role in co-ordinating growth and patterning.

the drosophila genes pig-1 and sgs-4 are adjacent and oppositely transcribed genes which share a common enhancer region located in the intergenic region between the two transcription start sites. both genes are transcribed in the same tissue, the larval salivary gland, but they are expressed at different times, the expression switching from pig-1 to sgs-4 expression during development of the third-instar larva. here we describe partial purification and functional analysis of a dna-binding protein, secretion enhancer binding protein 1 (sebp1), from nuclear extracts of whole drosophila larvae. sebp1 binds to a single site within the pig-1/sgs-4 intergenic region. point mutations that disrupt this site had no significant effect on activation of the sgs-4 promoter in constructs lacking the pig-1 promoter. however, if the pig-1 promoter was present, the same mutations led to a strong attenuation of sgs-4 promoter activity, suggesting that binding of sebp1 is necessary for the pig-1/sgs-4 transcriptional switch. the data are consistent with a model in which the sebp1 binding site acts as a transient silencing element that facilitates the reorganization of promoter-enhancer interactions by disrupting pre-existing interactions, thus enabling stage-specific activators of sgs-4 to bind to their enhancer target sites.

pax6 plays a key role in visual system development throughout the metazoa and the function of pax6 is evolutionarily conserved. however, the regulation of pax6 expression during eye development is largely unknown. we have identified two physically distinct promoters in mouse pax6, p0 and p1, that direct differential pax6 expression in the developing eye. p0-initiated transcripts predominate in lens placode and corneal and conjunctival epithelia, whereas p1-initiated transcripts are expressed in lens placode, optic vesicle and cns, and only weakly in corneal and conjunctival epithelia. to further investigate their tissue-specific expression, a series of constructs for each promoter were examined in transgenic mice. we identified three different regulatory regions which direct distinct domains of pax6 expression in the eye. a regulatory element upstream of the pax6 p0 promoter is required for expression in a subpopulation of retinal progenitors and in the developing pancreas, while a second regulatory element upstream of the pax6 p1 promoter is sufficient to direct expression in a subset of post-mitotic, non-terminally differentiated photoreceptors. a third element in pax6 intron 4, when combined with either the p0 or p1 promoter, accurately directs expression in amacrine cells, ciliary body and iris. these results indicate that the complex expression pattern of pax6 is differentially regulated by two promoters acting in combination with multiple cis-acting elements. we have also tested whether the regulatory mechanisms that direct pax6 ocular expression are conserved between mice and flies. remarkably, when inserted upstream of either the mouse pax6 p1 or p0 promoter, an eye-enhancer region of the drosophila eyeless gene, a pax6 homolog, directs eye- and cns-specific expression in transgenic mice that accurately reproduces features of endogenous pax6 expression. these results suggest that in addition to conservation of pax6 function, the upstream regulation of pax6 has also been conserved during evolution.

concentration of maternal bicoid (bcd) establishes the anterior pattern in the drosophila embryo. successive deletions in the bcd promoter allowed us to localize an enhancer sequence in the 5'-utr and a down-regulating element downstream of the atg initiator codon, and identify a 49 bp region sufficient to drive transcription of a reporter gene specifically in nurse cells. this fragment contains two binding sites for the serendipity (sry) d zinc finger activator, that mediate its cooperative binding. both sites (sdbs) are essential for bcd expression. further analysis showed that the bcd promoter configuration is decisive for sry d activating function. replacement of sdbs by binding sites for sry b, the sry d paralog, restores bcd transcription in sry d mutant ovaries, demonstrating that the functional divergence between these two proteins during evolution was mainly driven by changes in their dna-specific recognition properties, resulting in the control of separate developmental pathways.

the function of the drosophila mef2 gene, a member of the mads box supergene family of transcription factors, is critical for terminal differentiation of the three major muscle cell types, namely somatic, visceral, and cardiac. during embryogenesis, mef2 undergoes multiple phases of expression, which are characterized by initial broad mesodermal expression, followed by restricted expression in the dorsal mesoderm, specific expression in muscle progenitors, and sustained expression in the differentiated musculatures. in this study, evidence is presented that temporally and spatially specific mef2 expression is controlled by a complex array of cis-acting regulatory modules that are responsive to different genetic signals. functional testing of approximately 12 kb of 5' flanking region of the mef2 gene showed that the initial widespread mesodermal expression is achieved through a 280-bp twist-dependent enhancer. the subsequent dorsal mesoderm-restricted mef2 expression is mediated through a 460-bp dpp-responsive regulatory module, which involves the function of the smad4 homolog medea and contains several binding sites for medea and mad. the analysis also showed that regulated mef2 expression in the caudal and trunk visceral mesoderm, which give rise to longitudinal and circular gut musculatures, respectively, is under the control of distinct enhancer elements. in addition, mef2 expression in the cardioblasts of the heart is dependent upon at least two distinct enhancers, which are active at different periods during embryogenesis. moreover, multiple regulatory elements are differentially activated for specific expression in presumptive muscle founders, prefusion myoblasts, and differentiated muscle fibers. taken together, the presented data suggest that specific expression of the mef2 gene in myogenic lineages in the drosophila embryo is the result of multiple genetic inputs that act in an additive manner upon distinct enhancers in the 5' flanking region.

different classes of vertebrate motor neuron that innervate distinct muscle targets express unique combinations of lim-homeodomain transcription factors, suggesting that a combinatorial code of lim-homeodomain proteins may underlie the control of motor-neuron pathway selection. studies of lim-homeodomain genes in mouse, drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans have revealed functions of these genes in neuronal survival, axon guidance, neurotransmitter expression and neuronal function, but, to our knowledge, none of these studies have addressed the issue of a functional code. here we study two members of this gene family in drosophila, namely lim3, the homologue of the vertebrate lhx3 and lhx4 genes, and islet, the homologue of the vertebrate isl1 and is12 genes. we show that drosophila lim3 is expressed by a specific subset of islet-expressing motor neurons and that mutating or misexpressing lim3 switches motor-neuron projections predictably. our results provide evidence that lim3 and islet constitute a combinatorial code that generates distinct motor-neuron identities.

the development of the drosophila compound eye requires the function of a set of evolutionarily conserved genes. among these, the drosophila pax-6 gene eyeless (ey) plays a major role. ey has been considered a master control gene of eye development in the animal kingdom because targeted expression of ey and vertebrate as well as invertebrate homologs lead to the formation of ectopic eyes in drosophila. we demonstrate that an intron of the ey gene contains an enhancer that regulates the eye specific expression of the gene in the eye disc primordia of embryos and in the eye imaginal discs of third instar larvae. moreover, a 212-bp enhancer element is necessary and sufficient for the enhancer function. it is partially conserved in drosophila hydei and contains putative pax-6 paired domain binding sites. we show that several binding sites are required for the eye specific expression, and, therefore, we propose a pax-6-like molecule to be a positive transactivator for the eye specific ey expression. this transactivator recently has been identified as twin of eyeless, the second pax-6 gene in drosophila.
