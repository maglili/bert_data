Expression of Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein enhances cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,22428051,10.1371/journal.pone.0033447,"Drosophila melanogaster experience cold shock injury and die when exposed to low non-freezing temperatures. In this study, we generated transgenic D. melanogaster that express putative Ixodes scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP) and show that the presence of IAFGP increases the ability of flies to survive in the cold. Male and female adult iafgp-expressing D. melanogaster exhibited higher survival rates compared with controls when placed at non-freezing temperatures. Increased hatching rates were evident in embryos expressing IAFGP when exposed to the cold. The TUNEL assay showed that flight muscles from iafgp-expressing female adult flies exhibited less apoptotic damage upon exposure to non-freezing temperatures in comparison to control flies. Collectively, these data suggest that expression of iafgp increases cold tolerance in flies by preventing apoptosis. This study defines a molecular basis for the role of an antifreeze protein in cryoprotection of flies.",2012,"Girish Neelakanta, Andrew M Hudson, Hameeda Sultana, Lynn Cooley, Erol Fikrig"
Population transcriptomics of cactus host shifts in Drosophila mojavensis,22512269,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05549.x,"In the presence of environmental change, natural selection can shape the transcriptome. Under a scenario of environmental change, genotypes that are better able to modulate gene expression to maximize fitness will tend to be favoured. Therefore, it is important to examine gene expression at the population level to distinguish random or neutral gene expression variation from the pattern produced by natural selection. This study investigates the natural variation in transcriptional response to a cactus host shift utilizing the mainland Sonora population of Drosophila mojavensis. Drosophila mojavensis is a cactophilic species composed of four cactus host populations endemic to the deserts of North America. Overall, the change in cactus host was associated with a significant reduction in larval viability as well as the differential expression of 21% of the genome (3109 genes). Among the genes identified were a set of genes previously known to be involved in xenobiotic metabolism, as well as genes involved in cellular energy production, oxidoreductase/carbohydrate metabolism, structural components and mRNA binding. Interestingly, of the 3109 genes whose expression was affected by host use, there was a significant overrepresentation of genes that lacked an orthologous call to the D. melanogaster genome, suggesting the possibility of an accelerated rate of evolution in these genes. Of the genes with a significant cactus effect, the majority, 2264 genes, did not exhibit a significant cactus-by-line interaction. This population-level approach facilitated the identification of genes involved in past cactus host shifts.",2012,"Luciano M Matzkin, Luciano M Matzkin"
Covalent attachment of heme to the protein moiety in an insect E75 nitric oxide sensor,22946928,10.1021/bi300848x,"We have recombinantly expressed and purified the ligand binding domains (LBDs) of four insect nuclear receptors of the E75 family. The Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori nuclear receptors were purified as ferric hemoproteins with Soret maxima at 424 nm, whereas their ferrous forms had a Soret maximum at 425 nm that responds to (??NO and CO binding. In contrast, the purified LBD of Oncopeltus fasciatus displayed a Soret maximum at 415 nm for the ferric protein that shifted to 425 nm in its ferrous state. Binding of (??NO to the heme moiety of the D. melanogaster and B. mori E75 LBD resulted in the appearance of a peak at 385 nm, whereas this peak appeared at 416 nm in the case of the O. fasciatus hemoprotein, resembling the behavior displayed by its human homologue, Rev-erbÎ². High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that, unlike the D. melanogaster and B. mori counterparts, the heme group of O. fasciatus is covalently attached to the protein through the side chains of two amino acids. The high degree of sequence homology with O. fasciatus E75 led us to clone and express the LBD of Blattella germanica, which established that its spectral properties closely resemble those of O. fasciatus and that it also has the heme group covalently bound to the protein. Hence, (??NO/CO regulation of the transcriptional activity of these nuclear receptors might be differently controlled among various insect species. In addition, covalent heme binding provides strong evidence that at least some of these nuclear receptors function as diatomic gas sensors rather than heme sensors. Finally, our findings expand the classes of hemoproteins in which the heme group is normally covalently attached to the polypeptide chain.",2012,"Clara Aicart-Ramos, Margarita Valhondo FalcÃ³n, Paul R Ortiz de Montellano, Ignacio Rodriguez-Crespo, Clara Aicart-Ramos, Margarita Valhondo FalcÃ³n, Paul R Ortiz de Montellano, Ignacio Rodriguez-Crespo"

Genome-wide association analysis of oxidative stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,22496853,10.1371/journal.pone.0034745,"Background:
      
    

    
      Aerobic organisms are susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress resistance is a quantitative trait with population variation attributable to the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Drosophila melanogaster provides an ideal system to study the genetics of variation for resistance to oxidative stress.
    

    
  


        Methods and findings:
      
    

    
      We used 167 wild-derived inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel for a genome-wide association study of acute oxidative stress resistance to two oxidizing agents, paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite. We found significant genetic variation for both stressors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in oxidative stress resistance were often sex-specific and agent-dependent, with a small subset common for both sexes or treatments. Associated SNPs had moderately large effects, with an inverse relationship between effect size and allele frequency. Linear models with up to 12 SNPs explained 67-79% and 56-66% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to paraquat and menadione sodium bisulfite, respectively. Many genes implicated were novel with no known role in oxidative stress resistance. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a cellular network comprising DNA metabolism and neuronal development, consistent with targets of oxidative stress-inducing agents. We confirmed associations of seven candidate genes associated with natural variation in oxidative stress resistance through mutational analysis.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We identified novel candidate genes associated with variation in resistance to oxidative stress that have context-dependent effects. These results form the basis for future translational studies to identify oxidative stress susceptibility/resistance genes that are evolutionary conserved and might play a role in human disease.",2012,"Allison L Weber, George F Khan, Michael M Magwire, Crystal L Tabor, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Allison L Weber, George F Khan, Michael M Magwire, Crystal L Tabor, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"
"Concentration-dependent, size-independent toxicity of citrate capped AuNPs in Drosophila melanogaster",22238688,10.1371/journal.pone.0029980,"The expected potential benefits promised by nanotechnology in various fields have led to a rapid increase of the presence of engineered nanomaterials in a high number of commercial goods. This is generating increasing questions about possible risks for human health and environment, due to the lack of an in-depth assessment of the physical/chemical factors responsible for their toxic effects. In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of monodisperse citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of different sizes (5, 15, 40, and 80 nm) in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, upon ingestion. To properly evaluate and distinguish the possible dose- and/or size-dependent toxicity of the AuNPs, we performed a thorough assessment of their biological effects, using two different dose-metrics. In the first approach, we kept constant the total surface area of the differently sized AuNPs (Total Exposed Surface area approach, TES), while, in the second approach, we used the same number concentration of the four different sizes of AuNPs (Total Number of Nanoparticles approach, TNN). We observed a significant AuNPs-induced toxicity in vivo, namely a strong reduction of Drosophila lifespan and fertility performance, presence of DNA fragmentation, as well as a significant modification in the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, DNA damage recognition and apoptosis pathway. Interestingly, we found that, within the investigated experimental conditions, the toxic effects in the exposed organisms were directly related to the concentration of the AuNPs administered, irrespective of their size.",2012,"Giuseppe Vecchio, Antonio Galeone, Virgilio Brunetti, Gabriele Maiorano, Stefania Sabella, Roberto Cingolani, Pier Paolo Pompa, Giuseppe Vecchio, Antonio Galeone, Virgilio Brunetti, Gabriele Maiorano, Stefania Sabella, Roberto Cingolani, Pier Paolo Pompa"
Disentangling the relationship between sex-biased gene expression and X-linkage,22499666,10.1101/gr.132100.111,"X chromosomes are preferentially transmitted through females, which may favor the accumulation of X-linked alleles/genes with female-beneficial effects. Numerous studies have shown that genes with sex-biased expression are under- or over-represented on the X chromosomes of a wide variety of organisms. The patterns, however, vary between different animal species, and the causes of these differences are unresolved. Additionally, genes with sex-biased expression tend to be narrowly expressed in a limited number of tissues, and narrowly expressed genes are also non-randomly X-linked in a taxon-specific manner. It is therefore unclear whether the unique gene content of the X chromosome is the result of selection on genes with sex-biased expression, narrowly expressed genes, or some combination of the two. To address this problem, we measured sex-biased expression in multiple Drosophila species and at different developmental time points. These data were combined with available expression measurements from Drosophila melanogaster and mouse to reconcile the inconsistencies in X-chromosome content among taxa. Our results suggest that most of the differences between Drosophila and mammals are confounded by disparate data collection/analysis approaches as well as the correlation between sex bias and expression breadth. Both the Drosophila and mouse X chromosomes harbor an excess of genes with female-biased expression after controlling for the confounding factors, suggesting that the asymmetrical transmission of the X chromosome favors the accumulation of female-beneficial mutations in X-linked genes. However, some taxon-specific patterns remain, and we provide evidence that these are in part a consequence of constraints imposed by the dosage compensation mechanism in Drosophila.",2012,"Richard P Meisel, John H Malone, Andrew G Clark, Richard P Meisel, John H Malone, Andrew G Clark"
Mitochondrial pseudogenes in the nuclear genomes of Drosophila,22412894,10.1371/journal.pone.0032593,"Mitochondrial pseudogenes in nuclear chromosomes (numts) have been detected in the genomes of a diverse range of eukaryotic species. However, the numt content of different genomes and their properties is not uniform, and study of these differences provides insight into the mechanisms and dynamics of genome evolution in different organisms. In the genus Drosophila, numts have previously only been identified on a genome-wide scale in the melanogaster subgroup. The present study extends the identification to 11 species of the Drosophila genus. We identify a total of 302 numts and show that the numt complement is highly variable in Drosophilids, ranging from just 4 in D. melanogaster to 67 in D. willistoni, broadly correlating with genome size. Many numts have undergone large-scale rearrangements in the nucleus, including interruptions, inversions, deletions and duplications of sequence of variable size. Estimating the age of the numts in the nucleus by phylogenetic tree reconstruction reveals the vast majority of numts to be recent gains, 90% having arisen on terminal branches of the species tree. By identifying paralogs and counting duplications among the extant numts we estimate that 23% of extant numts arose through post-insertion duplications. We estimate genus average rates of insertion of 0.75 per million years, and a duplication rate of 0.010 duplications per numt per million years.",2012,"Hubert H Rogers, Sam Griffiths-Jones, Hubert H Rogers, Sam Griffiths-Jones"
Role of D1- and D2-like receptors in age-specific regulation of juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdysone levels by dopamine in Drosophila,23017333,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.09.005,"In Drosophila females, the precursor of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), ecdysone, is synthesized in the ovary follicular cells. Juvenile hormone (JH) is synthesized de novo in the specialized endocrine gland, corpus allatum (CA); JH degradation is carried out by the enzymes synthesized in the fat body (FB). Earlier we have shown that in Drosophila females, dopamine up- or down-regulates 20E and JH levels depending on the developmental stage. The present study focuses on the role of D1- and D2-like receptors in the age-specific regulation of 20E and JH metabolism by dopamine. We show that in Drosophila melanogaster females D1- and D2-like receptor genes (DopR and DD2R accordingly) are expressed in CA and FB, but not in follicular cells. The level of DopR expression in CA is much higher in the young than in the mature females, whereas DD2R expression is much higher in the mature than in the young females. The DopR and DD2R expression patterns in FB are opposite to those observed in CA. In addition, we obtained data suggesting that the age-specific changes of DopR and DD2R expression in FB are under the control of 20E.",2012,"N ? Gruntenko, O V Laukhina, I Yu Rauschenbach, N ?

Different requirements for proteolytic processing of bone morphogenetic protein 5/6/7/8 ligands in Drosophila melanogaster,22199351,10.1074/jbc.M111.316745,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are synthesized as proproteins that undergo proteolytic processing by furin/subtilisin proprotein convertases to release the active ligand. Here we study processing of BMP5/6/7/8 proteins, including the Drosophila orthologs Glass Bottom Boat (Gbb) and Screw (Scw) and human BMP7. Gbb and Scw have three functional furin/subtilisin proprotein convertase cleavage sites; two between the prodomain and ligand domain, which we call the Main and Shadow sites, and one within the prodomain, which we call the Pro site. In Gbb each site can be cleaved independently, although efficient cleavage at the Shadow site requires cleavage at the Main site, and remarkably, none of the sites is essential for Gbb function. Rather, Gbb must be processed at either the Pro or Main site to produce a functional ligand. Like Gbb, the Pro and Main sites in Scw can be cleaved independently, but cleavage at the Shadow site is dependent on cleavage at the Main site. However, both Pro and Main sites are essential for Scw function. Thus, Gbb and Scw have different processing requirements. The BMP7 ligand rescues gbb mutants in Drosophila, but full-length BMP7 cannot, showing that functional differences in the prodomain limit the BMP7 activity in flies. Furthermore, unlike Gbb, cleavage-resistant BMP7, although non-functional in rescue assays, activates the downstream signaling cascade and thus retains some functionality. Our data show that cleavage requirements evolve rapidly, supporting the notion that changes in post-translational processing are used to create functional diversity between BMPs within and between species.",2012,"Cornelia Fritsch, Annick Sawala, Robin Harris, Aidan Maartens, Catherine Sutcliffe, Hilary L Ashe, Robert P Ray, Cornelia Fritsch, Annick Sawala, Robin Harris, Aidan Maartens, Catherine Sutcliffe, Hilary L Ashe, Robert P Ray"
Olfactory conditioning in the third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster using heat shock reinforcement,21833772,10.1007/s10519-011-9487-9,"Adult Drosophila melanogaster has long been a popular model for learning and memory studies. Now the larval stage of the fruit fly is also being used in an increasing number of classical conditioning studies. In this study, we employed heat shock as a novel negative reinforcement for larvae and obtained high learning scores following just one training trial. We demonstrated heat-shock conditioning in both reciprocal and non-reciprocal paradigms and observed that the time window of association for the odor and heat shock reinforcement is on the order of a few minutes. This is slightly wider than the time window for electroshock conditioning reported in previous studies, possibly due to lingering effects of the high temperature. To test the utility of this simplified assay for the identification of new mutations that disrupt learning, we examined flies carrying mutations in the dnc gene. While the sensitivity to heat shock, as tested by writhing, was similar for wild type and dnc homozygotes, dnc mutations strongly diminished learning. We confirmed that the learning defect in dnc flies was indeed due to mutation in the dnc gene using non-complementation analysis. Given that heat shock has not been employed as a reinforcement for larvae in the past, we explored learning as a function of heat shock intensity and found that optimal learning occurred around 41 Â°C, with higher and lower temperatures both resulting in lower learning scores. In summary, we have developed a very simple, robust paradigm of learning in fruit fly larvae using heat shock reinforcement.",2012,"Sukant Khurana, Brooks G Robinson, Zihe Wang, William C Shropshire, Allen C Zhong, Laura E Garcia, Jonathan Corpuz, Jonathan Chow, Michael M Hatch, Eric F Precise, Amanda Cady, Ryan M Godinez, Terapat Pulpanyawong, Andrew T Nguyen, Wen-Ke Li, Max Seiter, Kambiz Jahanian, Jeffrey C Sun, Ruchita Shah, Sunaina Rajani, William Y Chen, Sofia Ray, Natalie V Ryazanova, Dorah Wakou, Rohith K Prabhu, Nigel S Atkinson, Sukant Khurana, Brooks G Robinson, Zihe Wang, William C Shropshire, Allen C Zhong, Laura E Garcia, Jonathan Corpuz, Jonathan Chow, Michael M Hatch, Eric F Precise, Amanda Cady, Ryan M Godinez, Terapat Pulpanyawong, Andrew T Nguyen, Wen-Ke Li, Max Seiter, Kambiz Jahanian, Jeffrey C Sun, Ruchita Shah, Sunaina Rajani, William Y Chen, Sofia Ray, Natalie V Ryazanova, Dorah Wakou, Rohith K Prabhu, Nigel S Atkinson"

Transgenic expression of the Helicobacter pylori virulence factor CagA promotes apoptosis or tumorigenesis through JNK activation in Drosophila,23093933,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002939,"Gastric cancer development is strongly correlated with infection by Helicobacter pylori possessing the effector protein CagA. Using a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model, we show that CagA expression in the simple model epithelium of the larval wing imaginal disc causes dramatic tissue perturbations and apoptosis when CagA-expressing and non-expressing cells are juxtaposed. This cell death phenotype occurs through activation of JNK signaling and is enhanced by loss of the neoplastic tumor suppressors in CagA-expressing cells or loss of the TNF homolog Eiger in wild type neighboring cells. We further explored the effects of CagA-mediated JNK pathway activation on an epithelium in the context of oncogenic Ras activation, using a Drosophila model of metastasis. In this model, CagA expression in epithelial cells enhances the growth and invasion of tumors in a JNK-dependent manner.

The pharmacological effects of low and moderate quantities of ethanol have remained understudied. In this study, we tested the acute effects of low doses of ethanol (?? mM internal concentration) on Drosophila larvae. While ethanol did not affect locomotion or the response to an odorant, we observed that ethanol impaired associative olfactory learning when the heat shock unconditioned stimulus (US) intensity was low but not when the heat shock US intensity was high. We determined that the reduction in learning at low US intensity was not a result of ethanol anesthesia since ethanol-treated larvae responded to the heat shock in the same manner as untreated animals. Instead, low doses of ethanol likely impair the neuronal plasticity that underlies olfactory associative learning. This impairment in learning was reversible indicating that exposure to low doses of ethanol does not leave any long lasting behavioral or physiological effects.",2012,"Brooks G Robinson, Sukant Khurana, Jascha B Pohl, Wen-ke Li, Alfredo Ghezzi, Amanda M Cady, Kristina Najjar, Michael M Hatch, Ruchita R Shah, Amar Bhat, Omar Hariri, Kareem B Haroun, Melvin C Young, Kathryn Fife, Jeff Hooten, Tuan Tran, Daniel Goan, Foram Desai, Farhan Husain, Ryan M Godinez, Jeffrey C Sun, Jonathan Corpuz, Jacxelyn Moran, Allen C Zhong, William Y Chen, Nigel S Atkinson, Brooks G Robinson, Sukant Khurana, Jascha B Pohl, Wen-ke Li, Alfredo Ghezzi, Amanda M Cady, Kristina Najjar, Michael M Hatch, Ruchita R Shah, Amar Bhat, Omar Hariri, Kareem B Haroun, Melvin C Young, Kathryn Fife, Jeff Hooten, Tuan Tran, Daniel Goan, Foram Desai, Farhan Husain, Ryan M Godinez, Jeffrey C Sun, Jonathan Corpuz, Jacxelyn Moran, Allen C Zhong, William Y Chen, Nigel S Atkinson"

Using cdBEST, we identified boundary sequences across 12 Drosophila species. Of the 4576 boundary sequences identified in Drosophila melanogaster genome, >170 sequences are repetitive in nature and have sequence homology to transposable elements. Analysis of such sequences across 12 Drosophila genomes showed that the occurrence of repetitive sequences in the context of boundaries is a common feature of drosophilids. We use a variety of genome organization criteria and also experimental test on a subset of the cdBEST boundaries in an enhancer-blocking assay and show that 80% of them indeed function as boundaries in vivo.

Network-level analyses of DNA divergence in Drosophila and vertebrates have revealed a clear gradient in the levels of purifying selection along this pathway, with the downstream genes being the most constrained. Remarkably, this feature does not result from factors known to affect selective constraint such as gene expression, codon bias, protein length, and connectivity. The present work aims to establish whether the selective constraint gradient detected along the IT pathway at the between-species level can also be observed at a shorter time scale. With this purpose, we have surveyed DNA polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster and divergence from D. simulans along the IT pathway. Our network-level analysis shows that DNA polymorphism exhibits the same polarity in the strength of purifying selection as previously detected at the divergence level. This equivalent feature detected both within species and between closely and distantly related species points to the action of a general mechanism, whose action is neither organism specific nor evolutionary time dependent.

Control of dendritic morphogenesis by Trio in Drosophila melanogaster,22438988,10.1371/journal.pone.0033737,"Abl tyrosine kinase and its effectors among the Rho family of GTPases each act to control dendritic morphogenesis in Drosophila. It has not been established, however, which of the many GTPase regulators in the cell link these signaling molecules in the dendrite. In axons, the bifunctional guanine exchange factor, Trio, is an essential link between the Abl tyrosine kinase signaling pathway and Rho GTPases, particularly Rac, allowing these systems to act coordinately to control actin organization. In dendritic morphogenesis, however, Abl and Rac have contrary rather than reinforcing effects, raising the question of whether Trio is involved, and if so, whether it acts through Rac, Rho or both. We now find that Trio is expressed in sensory neurons of the Drosophila embryo and regulates their dendritic arborization. trio mutants display a reduction in dendritic branching and increase in average branch length, whereas over-expression of trio has the opposite effect. We further show that it is the Rac GEF domain of Trio, and not its Rho GEF domain that is primarily responsible for the dendritic function of Trio. Thus, Trio shapes the complexity of dendritic arbors and does so in a way that mimics the effects of its target, Rac.",2012,"Madhuri Shivalkar, Edward Giniger, Madhuri Shivalkar, Edward Giniger"
Extent With Modification: Leg Patterning in the Beetle Tribolium castaneum and the Evolution of Serial Homologs,22384402,10.1534/g3.111.001537,"Serial homologs are similar structures that develop at different positions within a body plan. These structures share some, but not all, aspects of developmental patterning, and their evolution is thought to be constrained by shared, pleiotropic gene functions. Here we describe the functions of 17 developmental genes during metamorphic development of the legs in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. This study provides informative comparisons between appendage development in Drosophila melanogaster and T. castaneum, between embryonic and adult development in T. castaneum, and between the development of serially homologous appendages. The leg gap genes Distal-less and dachshund are conserved in function. Notch signaling, the zinc-finger transcription factors related to odd-skipped, and bric-?-brac have conserved functions in promoting joint development. homothorax knockdown alters the identity of proximal leg segments but does not reduce growth. Lim1 is required for intermediate leg development but not distal tarsus and pretarsus development as in D. melanogaster. Development of the tarsus requires decapentaplegic, rotund, spineless, abrupt, and bric-?-brac and the EGF ligand encoded by Keren. Metathoracic legs of T. castaneum have four tarsomeres, whereas other legs have five.

We used Drosophila melanogaster to examine the function of Prx3, the Drosophila homolog of human PRDX3. The oxidative stress response in adult Drosophila is age-dependent. RNAiinduced Prx3 knockdown in adult flies did not change their phenotype in normal conditions, but they had a shorter survival than the Prx3(+) controls in the presence of H2O2. The expression levels of the Prx3 were reduced by aging. These results suggest that Prx3 plays an important role in the oxidative stress response and is involved in the age-dependent competence of the oxidative stress response.",2012,"Yasunari Kayashima, Kimiko Yamakawa-Kobayashi, Yasunari Kayashima, Kimiko Yamakawa-Kobayashi"
"Methamphetamine causes anorexia in Drosophila melanogaster, exhausting metabolic reserves and contributing to mortality",22863857,10.2131/jts.37.773,"Methamphetamine (MA) appears to produce neurotoxic effects, in part, through disruptions of energy metabolism. A recent study of the whole-body proteome of Drosophila melanogaster showed many changes in energy metabolism-related proteins, leading us to hypothesize that MA toxicity may cause whole-body disruptions of energy metabolism. To test this, we monitored the response of energy reserves and other metabolites to MA-exposure with and without the addition of dietary glucose. We also monitored changes in feeding behavior, locomotor activity and respiration rates associated with MA-exposure to investigate how MA affects energy balance. We observed that glycogen and triglyceride levels decreased dramatically within 48 hr of MA-exposure, indicating a strongly negative caloric balance. Behavioral assays revealed that MA-treated flies decreased food consumption by 60-80% and exhibited a 2-fold increase in locomotion. Caloric expenditure decreased with MA-exposure, apparently due to a compensatory decrease in resting metabolism, showing that anorexia was the primary driver of the negative caloric balance. Additionally, we observed that glucose supplementation of MA-containing diet increased glycogen reserves by 44% at 48 hr, leading to a commensurate increase in survivorship. We conclude that dietary sugar supplementation enhances survivorship by partially compensating for decreased caloric intake resulting from MA-induced anorexia. The observation that MA produces similar behavioral changes in Drosophila and humans, i.e. increased locomotor activity and anorexia, further supports the use of Drosophila as a model organism for the study of the effects of MA.",2012,"Kent R Walters Jr, S Indu Rupassara, R J Cody Markelz, Andrew D B Leakey, William M Muir, Barry R Pittendrigh, Kent R Walters Jr, S Indu Rupassara, R J Cody Markelz, Andrew D B Leakey, William M Muir, Barry R Pittendrigh"
The synthesis-diffusion-degradation model explains Bicoid gradient formation in unfertilized eggs,23011646,10.1088/1478-3975/9/5/055004,"Precise formation of morphogen gradients is essential to the establishment of reproducible pattern in development. Mechanisms proposed for obtaining the requisite precision range from simple models with few parameters to more complex models involving many regulated quantities. The synthesis-diffusion-degradation (SDD) model is a relatively simple model explaining the formation of the Bicoid gradient in Drosophila melanogaster, in which the steady-state characteristic length of the gradient is determined solely by the rates of diffusion and degradation of the morphogen. In this work, we test the SDD model in unfertilized D. melanogaster eggs, which contain a single female pronucleus and lack the nuclear division cycles and other zygotic regulatory processes seen in fertilized eggs. Using two-photon live imaging as well as a novel method for quantitative imaging based on decorrelation of photoswitching waveforms, we find that the Bicoid gradient is longer and shallower in unfertilized eggs as compared to the gradient at the same time points in fertilized eggs. Using a means of measuring the Bicoid lifetime by conjugation to a photoconvertible fluorophore, we find that the lifetime is correspondingly longer in unfertilized eggs, providing qualitative and quantitative agreement with the predictions of the SDD model.",2012,"J A Drocco, E F Wieschaus, D W Tank, J A Drocco, E F Wieschaus, D W Tank"
[Functional interactions between promoters of neighboring yellow and CG3777 genes in Drosophila melanogaster],23516896,,"It was shown by us previously that the transcription of the yellow gene can be affected by the promoter of the neighboring gene CG3777, which has a similar expression profile. In the present work, we continued studying the functional interactions between the promoters of the yellow and CG3777 genes in transgenic Drosophila strains. In this work, we used the failure of the yeast activator GAL4 to stimulate transcription from the promoter of the yellow gene for the case when GAL4-binding sites are localized at the 3'-end of the gene. It has been found that, if the 983-bp CG3777 gene promoter is inserted in transgenic strains in the same orientation with the yellow gene promoter, downstream from the sites of the GAL4 activator, the CG3777 promoter provides a strong stimulation of the yellow gene by the GAL4 activator. When the promoters of the yellow and CG3777 genes are inserted in opposite orientations relative to one another, no stimulation of the yellow gene by GAL4 is observed. Additional results obtained in the work demonstrate that the functional interacton between the CG3777 and yellow promoters depends on their mutual orientation and position relative to the GAL4-binding sites.",2012,"D V Leman, A F Parshikov, P G Georgiev, O G Maksimenko, D V Leman, A F Parshikov, P G Georgiev, O G Maksimenko"

We show that these cells share many ultrastructural and morphological features with Drosophila melanogaster plasmatocytes, although they are involved in the formation of the external layers of the cellular capsule, a functional property exhibited by lamellocytes in D. melanogaster.

A neuropeptide signaling pathway regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila,22331845,10.1083/jcb.201109044,"Neuropeptide signaling is integral to many aspects of neural communication, particularly modulation of membrane excitability and synaptic transmission. However, neuropeptides have not been clearly implicated in synaptic growth and development. Here, we demonstrate that cholecystokinin-like receptor (CCKLR) and drosulfakinin (DSK), its predicted ligand, are strong positive growth regulators of the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Mutations of CCKLR or dsk produced severe NMJ undergrowth, whereas overexpression of CCKLR caused overgrowth. Presynaptic expression of CCKLR was necessary and sufficient for regulating NMJ growth. CCKLR and dsk mutants also reduced synaptic function in parallel with decreased NMJ size. Analysis of double mutants revealed that DSK/CCKLR regulation of NMJ growth occurs through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) pathway. Our results demonstrate a novel role for neuropeptide signaling in synaptic development. Moreover, because the cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway is required for structural synaptic plasticity in learning and memory, DSK/CCKLR signaling may also contribute to these mechanisms.",2012,"Xu Chen, Barry Ganetzky, Xu Chen, Barry Ganetzky"
Expression of human paraoxonase 1 decreases superoxide levels and alters bacterial colonization in the gut of Drosophila melanogaster,22952763,10.1371/journal.pone.0043777,"Paraoxonases (PON) are a family of proteins (PON1, 2 and 3) with multiple enzymatic activities. PON1 interferes with homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing in bacteria and with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in humans and mice. PON1 gene mutations have been linked to multiple traits, including aging, and diseases of the cardiovascular, nervous and gastrointestinal system. The overlapping enzymatic activities in the PON family members and high linkage disequilibrium rates within their polymorphisms confound animal and human studies of PON1 function. In contrast, arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster have no PON homologs, resulting in an ideal model to study interactions between PON genotype and host phenotypes. We hypothesized that expression of PON1 in D. melanogaster would alter ROS. We found that PON1 alters expression of multiple oxidative stress genes and decreases superoxide anion levels in normal and germ-free D. melanogaster. We also found differences in the composition of the gut microbiota, with a remarkable increase in levels of Lactobacillus plantarum and associated changes in expression of antimicrobial and cuticle-related genes. PON1 expression directly decreased superoxide anion levels and altered bacterial colonization of the gut and its gene expression profile, highlighting the complex nature of the interaction between host genotype and gut microbiota.

Methods to assay Drosophila behavior,22433384,10.3791/3795,"Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been used to study molecular mechanisms of a wide range of human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and various neurological diseases(1). We have optimized simple and robust behavioral assays for determining larval locomotion, adult climbing ability (RING assay), and courtship behaviors of Drosophila. These behavioral assays are widely applicable for studying the role of genetic and environmental factors on fly behavior. Larval crawling ability can be reliably used for determining early stage changes in the crawling abilities of Drosophila larvae and also for examining effect of drugs or human disease genes (in transgenic flies) on their locomotion. The larval crawling assay becomes more applicable if expression or abolition of a gene causes lethality in pupal or adult stages, as these flies do not survive to adulthood where they otherwise could be assessed. This basic assay can also be used in conjunction with bright light or stress to examine additional behavioral responses in Drosophila larvae. Courtship behavior has been widely used to investigate genetic basis of sexual behavior, and can also be used to examine activity and coordination, as well as learning and memory. Drosophila courtship behavior involves the exchange of various sensory stimuli including visual, auditory, and chemosensory signals between males and females that lead to a complex series of well characterized motor behaviors culminating in successful copulation. Traditional adult climbing assays (negative geotaxis) are tedious, labor intensive, and time consuming, with significant variation between different trials(2-4). The rapid iterative negative geotaxis (RING) assay(5) has many advantages over more widely employed protocols, providing a reproducible, sensitive, and high throughput approach to quantify adult locomotor and negative geotaxis behaviors. In the RING assay, several genotypes or drug treatments can be tested simultaneously using large number of animals, with the high-throughput approach making it more amenable for screening experiments.",2012,"Charles D Nichols, Jaime Becnel, Udai B Pandey, Charles D Nichols, Jaime Becnel, Udai B Pandey"
Wolbachia infection decreased the resistance of Drosophila to lead,22403688,10.1371/journal.pone.0032643,"Background:
      
    

    
      The heavy metal lead has been shown to be associated with a genotoxic risk. Drosophila melanogaster is a model organism commonly utilized in genetic toxicology testing. The endosymbionts--Wolbachia are now very common in both wild populations and laboratory stocks of Drosophila. Wolbachia may induce resistance to pathogenic viruses, filarial nematodes and Plasmodium in fruit fly and mosquito hosts. However the effect of Wolbachia infection on the resistance of their hosts to heavy metal is unknown.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Manipulating the lead content in the diet of Drosophila melanogaster, we found that lead consumption had no different effects on developmental time between Wolbachia-infected (Dmel wMel) and -uninfected (Dmel T) flies. While in Pb-contaminated medium, significantly reduced amount of pupae and adults of Dmel wMel were emerged, and Dmel wMel adults had significantly shorter longevity than that of Dmel T flies. Lead infusion in diet resulted in significantly decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in Dmel T flies (P<0.05), but not in Dmel wMel flies. Correspondingly, lead cultures induced a 10.8 fold increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) contents in Dmel T larvae (P<0.05). While in Dmel wMel larvae, it resulted in only a 1.3 fold increase. By quantitative RT-PCR, we showed that lead infused medium caused significantly increased expression level of relish and CecA2 genes in Dmel T flies (P<0.01). Lead cultures did not change dramatically the expression of these genes in Dmel wMel flies.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      These results suggest that Wolbachia infection decreased the resistance of Drosophila to lead likely by limiting the production of peroxides resulted from lead, thus being unable to activate the immunological pathway in the host to prevent them from lead damage. This represents a novel Wolbachia-host interaction and provides information that researchers working on Drosophila toxicology should take in consideration the presence of Wolbachia in the stocks they are analyzing.",2012,"Ling Wang, Chun Zhou, Zhen He, Zheng-Guang Wang, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang, Ling Wang, Chun Zhou, Zhen He, Zheng-Guang Wang, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang"
A Drosophila DEG/ENaC subunit functions specifically in gustatory neurons required for male courtship behavior,22457513,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6178-11.2012,"Detection of specific female pheromones stimulates courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster males, but the chemosensory molecules, cells, and mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here we show that ppk25, a DEG/ENaC ion channel subunit required for normal male response to females, is expressed at highest levels in a single sexually dimorphic gustatory neuron of most taste hairs on legs and wings, but not in neurons that detect courtship-inhibiting pheromones or food. Synaptic inactivation of ppk25-expressing neurons, or knockdown of ppk25 expression in all gustatory neurons, significantly impairs male response to females, whereas gustatory expression of ppk25 rescues the courtship behavior of ppk25 mutant males. Remarkably, the only other detectable albeit significantly weaker expression of ppk25 occurs in olfactory neurons implicated in modulation of courtship behavior. However, expression of ppk25 in olfactory neurons is not required for male courtship under our experimental conditions. These data show that ppk25 functions specifically in peripheral taste neurons involved in activation of courtship behavior, an unexpected function for this type of channel. Furthermore, our work identifies a small subset of gustatory neurons with an essential role in activation of male courtship behavior, most likely in response to female pheromones.",2012,"Elena Starostina, Tong Liu, Vinoy Vijayan, Zheng Zheng, Kathleen K Siwicki, Claudio W Pikielny, Elena Starostina, Tong Liu, Vinoy Vijayan, Zheng Zheng, Kathleen K Siwicki, Claudio W Pikielny"

The pore traverses the membrane and extends into the cytosol. A ring of glutamate residues on its extracellular side forms the selectivity filter. A basic region near the intracellular side can bind anions that may stabilize the closed state. The architecture of the channel differs markedly from other ion channels and gives insight into the principles of selective calcium permeation and gating.",2012,"Xiaowei Hou, Leanne Pedi, Melinda M Diver, Stephen B Long, Xiaowei Hou, Leanne Pedi, Melinda M Diver, Stephen B Long"
Loss of reproductive parasitism following transfer of male-killing Wolbachia to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,22892635,10.1038/hdy.2012.43,"Wolbachia manipulate insect host biology through a variety of means that result in increased production of infected females, enhancing its own transmission.

In this study, we transferred wInn to D. melanogaster and D. simulans by embryonic microinjection, expecting conservation of the male-killing phenotype to the novel hosts, which are more suitable for genetic analysis. In contrast to our expectations, there was no effect on offspring sex ratio. Furthermore, no CI was observed in the transinfected flies. Overall, transinfected D. melanogaster lines displayed lower transmission rate and lower densities of Wolbachia than transinfected D. simulans lines, in which established infections were transmitted with near-perfect fidelity. In D. simulans, strain wInn had no effect on fecundity and egg-to-adult development. Surprisingly, one of the two transinfected lines tested showed increased longevity.

One of those proteins has been identified to be an uncharacterized protein called Drosophila melanogaster calcium-binding protein 1 (DmCaBP1). This protein containing the thioredoxin-like domain resided in the endoplasmic reticulum and seemed to be expressed ubiquitously throughout the development of Drosophila. DmCaBP1 was externalized without truncation after the induction of apoptosis somewhat prior to chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage in a manner dependent on the activity of caspases. A recombinant DmCaBP1 protein bound to both apoptotic cells and a hemocyte-derived cell line expressing Draper. Forced expression of DmCaBP1 at the cell surface made non-apoptotic cells susceptible to phagocytosis. Flies deficient in DmCaBP1 expression developed normally and showed Draper-mediated pruning of larval axons, but a defect in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in embryos was observed. Loss of Pretaporter, a previously identified ligand for Draper, did not cause a further decrease in the level of phagocytosis in DmCaBP1-lacking embryos.

However, many biologically interesting myosin isoforms are expressed at levels that are too low for direct purification from primary tissues. Efforts aimed at recombinant expression of functional striated muscle myosin isoforms in bacterial or insect cell culture have largely met with failure, although high level expression in muscle cell culture has recently been achieved at significant expense. We report a novel method for the use of strains of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster genetically engineered to produce histidine-tagged recombinant muscle myosin isoforms. This method takes advantage of the single muscle myosin heavy chain gene within the Drosophila genome, the high level of expression of accessible myosin in the thoracic indirect flight muscles, the ability to knock out endogenous expression of myosin in this tissue and the relatively low cost of fruit fly colony production and maintenance. We illustrate this method by expressing and purifying a recombinant histidine-tagged variant of embryonic body wall skeletal muscle myosin II from an engineered fly strain.

Molecular evolution in nonrecombining regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome,22275518,10.1093/gbe/evs010,"We study the evolutionary effects of reduced recombination on the Drosophila melanogaster genome, analyzing more than 200 new genes that lack crossing-over and employing a novel orthology search among species of the melanogaster subgroup. These genes are located in the heterochromatin of chromosomes other than the dot (fourth) chromosome. Noncrossover regions of the genome all exhibited an elevated level of evolutionary divergence from D. yakuba at nonsynonymous sites, lower codon usage bias, lower GC content in coding and noncoding regions, and longer introns. Levels of gene expression are similar for genes in regions with and without crossing-over, which rules out the possibility that the reduced level of adaptation that we detect is caused by relaxed selection due to lower levels of gene expression in the heterochromatin. The patterns observed are consistent with a reduction in the efficacy of selection in all regions of the genome of D. melanogaster that lack crossing-over, as a result of the effects of enhanced Hill-Robertson interference. However, we also detected differences among nonrecombining locations: The X chromosome seems to exhibit the weakest effects, whereas the fourth chromosome and the heterochromatic genes on the autosomes located most proximal to the centromere showed the largest effects.

Aster migration determines the length scale of nuclear separation in the Drosophila syncytial embryo,22711698,10.1083/jcb.201204019,"In the early embryo of many species, comparatively small spindles are positioned near the cell center for subsequent cytokinesis. In most insects, however, rapid nuclear divisions occur in the absence of cytokinesis, and nuclei distribute rapidly throughout the large syncytial embryo. Even distribution and anchoring of nuclei at the embryo cortex are crucial for cellularization of the blastoderm embryo. The principles underlying nuclear dispersal in a syncytium are unclear. We established a cell-free system from individual Drosophila melanogaster embryos that supports successive nuclear division cycles with native characteristics. This allowed us to investigate nuclear separation in predefined volumes. Encapsulating nuclei in microchambers revealed that the early cytoplasm is programmed to separate nuclei a distinct distance. Laser microsurgery revealed an important role of microtubule aster migration through cytoplasmic space, which depended on F-actin and cooperated with anaphase spindle elongation.

Ancestral resurrection of the Drosophila S2E enhancer reveals accessible evolutionary paths through compensatory change,24408913,10.1093/molbev/msu042,"Upstream regulatory sequences that control gene expression evolve rapidly, yet the expression patterns and functions of most genes are typically conserved. To address this paradox, we have reconstructed computationally and resurrected in vivo the cis-regulatory regions of the ancestral Drosophila eve stripe 2 element and evaluated its evolution using a mathematical model of promoter function. Our feed-forward transcriptional model predicts gene expression patterns directly from enhancer sequence. We used this functional model along with phylogenetics to generate a set of possible ancestral eve stripe 2 sequences for the common ancestors of 1) D. simulans and D. sechellia; 2) D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. sechellia; and 3) D. erecta and D. yakuba. These ancestral sequences were synthesized and resurrected in vivo. Using a combination of quantitative and computational analysis, we find clear support for functional compensation between the binding sites for Bicoid, Giant, and KrÃ¼ppel over the course of 40-60 My of Drosophila evolution. We show that this compensation is driven by a coupling interaction between Bicoid activation and repression at the anterior and posterior border necessary for proper placement of the anterior stripe 2 border.

Drosophila melanogaster cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal protein essential for fly development,25173815,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2014.08.012,"Mammalian cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes is a lysosomal glycoprotein implicated in cellular growth and differentiation. The genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encodes a putative orthologue (dCREG), suggesting evolutionarily conserved physiological functions of this protein. In D. melanogaster S2 cells, dCREG was found to localize in lysosomes. Further studies revealed that intracellular dCREG is subject of proteolytic maturation. Processing and turnover could be substantially reduced by RNAi-mediated silencing of cathepsin L. In contrast to mammalian cells, lysosomal delivery of dCREG does not depend on its carbohydrate moiety. Furthermore, depletion of the putative D. melanogaster lysosomal sorting receptor lysosomal enzyme receptor protein did not compromise cellular retention of dCREG. We also investigated the developmental consequences of dCREG ablation in whole D. melanogaster flies. Ubiquitous depletion of dCREG proved lethal at the late pupal stage once a knock-down efficiency of >95% was achieved. These results demonstrate that dCREG is essential for proper completion of fly development.",2014,"Elisabeth Kowalewski-Nimmerfall, Philipp SchÃ¤hs, Daniel Maresch, Dubravko Rendic, Helmut KrÃ¤mer, Lukas Mach"
Protein kinase Darkener of apricot and its substrate EF1Î³ regulate organelle transport along microtubules,24163433,10.1242/jcs.123885,"Regulation of organelle transport along microtubules is important for proper distribution of membrane organelles and protein complexes in the cytoplasm. RNAi-mediated knockdown in cultured Drosophila S2 cells demonstrates that two microtubule-binding proteins, a unique isoform of Darkener of apricot (DOA) protein kinase, and its substrate, translational elongation factor EF1Î³, negatively regulate transport of several classes of membrane organelles along microtubules. Inhibition of transport by EF1Î³ requires its phosphorylation by DOA on serine 294. Together, our results indicate a new role for two proteins that have not previously been implicated in regulation of the cytoskeleton. These results further suggest that the biological role of some of the proteins binding to the microtubule track is to regulate cargo transport along these tracks.",2014,"Anna S Serpinskaya, Karine Tuphile, Leonard Rabinow, Vladimir I Gelfand, Anna S Serpinskaya, Karine Tuphile, Leonard Rabinow, Vladimir I Gelfand"
Synergistic interactions between the molecular and neuronal circadian networks drive robust behavioral circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster,24698952,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004252,"Most organisms use 24-hr circadian clocks to keep temporal order and anticipate daily environmental changes. In Drosophila melanogaster CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) initiates the circadian system by promoting rhythmic transcription of hundreds of genes. However, it is still not clear whether high amplitude transcriptional oscillations are essential for circadian timekeeping. In order to address this issue, we generated flies in which the amplitude of CLK-driven transcription can be reduced partially (approx. 60%) or strongly (90%) without affecting the average levels of CLK-target genes. The impaired transcriptional oscillations lead to low amplitude protein oscillations that were not sufficient to drive outputs of peripheral oscillators. However, circadian rhythms in locomotor activity were resistant to partial reduction in transcriptional and protein oscillations. We found that the resilience of the brain oscillator is depending on the neuronal communication among circadian neurons in the brain. Indeed, the capacity of the brain oscillator to overcome low amplitude transcriptional oscillations depends on the action of the neuropeptide PDF and on the pdf-expressing cells having equal or higher amplitude of molecular rhythms than the rest of the circadian neuronal groups in the fly brain. Therefore, our work reveals the importance of high amplitude transcriptional oscillations for cell-autonomous circadian timekeeping. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circadian neuronal network is an essential buffering system that protects against changes in circadian transcription in the brain.",2014,"Ron Weiss, Osnat Bartok, Shaul Mezan, Yuval Malka, Sebastian Kadener, Ron Weiss, Osnat Bartok, Shaul Mezan, Yuval Malka, Sebastian Kadener"
Unexpected role of the steroid-deficiency protein ecdysoneless in pre-mRNA splicing,24722212,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004287,"The steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates insect growth and development, directing the major postembryonic transition of forms, metamorphosis. The steroid-deficient ecdysoneless1 (ecd1) strain of Drosophila melanogaster has long served to assess the impact of ecdysone on gene regulation, morphogenesis, or reproduction. However, ecd also exerts cell-autonomous effects independently of the hormone, and mammalian Ecd homologs have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and cancer. Why the Drosophila ecd1 mutants lack ecdysone has not been resolved. Here, we show that in Drosophila cells, Ecd directly interacts with core components of the U5 snRNP spliceosomal complex, including the conserved Prp8 protein. In accord with a function in pre-mRNA splicing, Ecd and Prp8 are cell-autonomously required for survival of proliferating cells within the larval imaginal discs. In the steroidogenic prothoracic gland, loss of Ecd or Prp8 prevents splicing of a large intron from CYP307A2/spookier (spok) pre-mRNA, thus eliminating this essential ecdysone-biosynthetic enzyme and blocking the entry to metamorphosis. Human Ecd (hEcd) can substitute for its missing fly ortholog. When expressed in the Ecd-deficient prothoracic gland, hEcd re-establishes spok pre-mRNA splicing and protein expression, restoring ecdysone synthesis and normal development. Our work identifies Ecd as a novel pre-mRNA splicing factor whose function has been conserved in its human counterpart.

Allelic asymmetry of the Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) gene expression in the hybrid between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: confirmation by using genetic variations of D. melanogaster,24379167,10.1007/s10709-013-9752-3,"In the cross between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males, hybrid males die at the late larval stage, and the sibling females also die at later stages at high temperatures. Removing the D. simulans allele of the Lethal hybrid rescue gene (Lhr (sim) ) improves the hybrid incompatibility phenotypes. However, the loss-of-function mutation of Lhr (sim) (Lhr (sim0) ) does not rescue the hybrid males in crosses with several D. melanogaster strains. We first describe the genetic factor possessed by the D. melanogaster strains. It has been suggested that removing the D. melanogaster allele of Lhr (Lhr (mel) ), that is Lhr (mel0) , does not have the hybrid male rescue effect, contrasting to Lhr (sim0) . Because the expression level of the Lhr gene is known to be Lhr (sim) > Lhr (mel) in the hybrid, Lhr (mel0) may not lead to enough of a reduction in total Lhr expression. Then, there is a possibility that the D. melanogaster factor changes the expression level to Lhr (sim) < Lhr (mel) . But in fact, the expression level was Lhr (sim) > Lhr (mel) in the hybrid irrespectively of the presence of the factor. At last, we showed that Lhr (mel0) slightly improves the viability of hybrid females, which was not realized previously. All of the present results are consistent with the allelic asymmetry model of the Lhr gene expression in the hybrid.",2014,"Mika Shirata, Quenta Araye, Kazunori Maehara, Sora Enya, Toshiyuki Takano-Shimizu, Kyoichi Sawamura"
Identification of gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) homologues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,24491521,10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.007,"Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) has been demonstrated to be involved in the immune response to bacterial challenge in various organisms. However, little is known about GILT function in innate immunity. Drosophila has been commonly used as a model for the study of the innate immune response of invertebrates. Here, we identify the CG9796, CG10157, and CG13822 genes of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as GILT homologues. All deduced Drosophila GILT coding sequences contained the major characteristic features of the GILT protein family: the GILT signature CQHGX2ECX2NX4C sequence and the active site CXXC or CXXS motif. The mRNA transcript levels of the Drosophila GILT genes were up-regulated after Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli DH5Î± infection. Moreover, a bacterial load assay showed that over-expression of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a low bacterial colony number whereas knock-down of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a high bacterial colony number when compared to a wild-type control. These results indicate that the Drosophila GILTs are very likely to play a role in the innate immune response upon bacterial challenge of Drosophila host defense.

A screen for F1 hybrid male rescue reveals no major-effect hybrid lethality loci in the Drosophila melanogaster autosomal genome,25352540,10.1534/g3.114.014076,"Hybrid sons between Drosophila melanogaster females and D. simulans males die as 3rd instar larvae. Two genes, D. melanogaster Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) on the X chromosome, and D. simulans Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) on chromosome II, interact to cause this lethality. Loss-of-function mutations in either gene suppress lethality, but several pieces of evidence suggest that additional factors are required for hybrid lethality. Here we screen the D. melanogaster autosomal genome by using the Bloomington Stock Center Deficiency kit to search for additional regions that can rescue hybrid male lethality. Our screen is designed to identify putative hybrid incompatibility (HI) genes similar to Hmr and Lhr which, when removed, are dominant suppressors of lethality. After screening 89% of the autosomal genome, we found no regions that rescue males to the adult stage. We did, however, identify several regions that rescue up to 13% of males to the pharate adult stage. This weak rescue suggests the presence of multiple minor-effect HI loci, but we were unable to map these loci to high resolution, presumably because weak rescue can be masked by genetic background effects. We attempted to test one candidate, the dosage compensation gene male specific lethal-3 (msl-3), by using RNA interference with short hairpin microRNA constructs targeted specifically against D. simulans msl-3 but failed to achieve knockdown, in part due to off-target effects. We conclude that the D. melanogaster autosomal genome likely does not contain additional major-effect HI loci. We also show that Hmr is insufficient to fully account for the lethality associated with the D. melanogaster X chromosome, suggesting that additional X-linked genes contribute to hybrid lethality.",2014,"Tawny N Cuykendall, P Satyaki, Shuqing Ji, Derek M Clay, Nathaniel B Edelman, Alexandra Kimchy, Ling-Hei Li, Erin A Nuzzo, Neil Parekh, Suna Park, Daniel A Barbash"
The Hippo effector Yorkie activates transcription by interacting with a histone methyltransferase complex through Ncoa6,25027438,10.7554/eLife.02564,"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates tissue growth in Drosophila through the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie (Yki).

Like Yki, Ncoa6 and Trr are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression. Strikingly, artificial tethering of Ncoa6 to Sd is sufficient to promote tissue growth and Yki target expression even in the absence of Yki, underscoring the importance of Yki-mediated recruitment of Ncoa6 in transcriptional activation. Consistent with the established role for the Trr complex in histone methylation, we show that Yki, Ncoa6, and Trr are required for normal H3K4 methylation at Hippo target genes. These findings shed light on Yki-mediated transcriptional regulation and uncover a potential link between chromatin modification and tissue growth.",2014,"Yun Qing, Feng Yin, Wei Wang, Yonggang Zheng, Pengfei Guo, Frederick Schozer, Hua Deng, Duojia Pan, Yun Qing, Feng Yin, Wei Wang, Yonggang Zheng, Pengfei Guo, Frederick Schozer, Hua Deng, Duojia Pan"

Sex-specific differences in desiccation resistance and the use of energy metabolites as osmolytes in Drosophila melanogaster flies acclimated to dehydration stress,24292242,10.1007/s00360-013-0790-z,"In the Indian subcontinent, there are significant between-population variations in desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster, but the physiological basis of adult acclimation responses to ecologically relevant humidity conditions is largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that increased desiccation resistance in acclimated flies is associated with changes in cuticular permeability and/or content of energy metabolites that act as osmolytes. Under an ecologically relevant humidity regime (~50 % relative humidity), both sexes showed desiccation acclimation which persisted for 2-3 days. However, only females responded to acclimation at ~5 % relative humidity (RH). Acclimated flies exhibited no changes in the rate of water loss, which is consistent with a lack of plastic changes in cuticular traits (body melanization, epicuticular lipid). Therefore, changes in cuticular permeability are unlikely in drought-acclimated adult flies of D. melanogaster. In acclimated flies, we found sex differences in changes in the content of osmolytes (trehalose in females versus glycogen in males). These sex-specific changes in osmolytes are rapid and reversible and match to corresponding changes in the increased desiccation resistance levels of acclimated flies. Further, the increased content of trehalose in females and glycogen in males support the bound-water hypothesis for water retention in acclimated flies. Thus, drought acclimation in adult flies of D. melanogaster involves inducible changes in osmolytes (trehalose and glycogen), while there is little support for changes in cuticular permeability.",2014,"Ravi Parkash, Divya Singh, Chanderkala Lambhod, Ravi Parkash, Divya Singh, Chanderkala Lambhod"
"Unlike in Drosophila Meroistic Ovaries, hippo represses notch in Blattella germanica Panoistic ovaries, triggering the mitosis-endocycle switch in the follicular cells",25426635,10.1371/journal.pone.0113850,"During insect oogenesis, the follicular epithelium undergoes both cell proliferation and apoptosis, thus modulating ovarian follicle growth. The Hippo pathway is key in these processes, and has been thoroughly studied in the meroistic ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. However, nothing is known about the role of the Hippo pathway in primitive panoistic ovaries. This work examines the mRNA expression levels of the main components of the Hippo pathway in the panoistic ovary of the basal insect species Blattella germanica, and demonstrates the function of Hippo through RNAi. In Hippo-depleted specimens, the follicular cells of the basal ovarian follicles proliferate without arresting cytokinesis; the epithelium therefore becomes bilayered, impairing ovarian follicle growth. This phenotype is accompanied by long stalks between the ovarian follicles. In D. melanogaster loss of function of Notch determines that the stalk is not developed. With this in mind, we tested whether Hippo and Notch pathways are related in B. germanica. In Notch (only)-depleted females, no stalks were formed between the ovarian follicles. Simultaneous depletion of Hippo and Notch rescued partially the stalk to wild-type. Unlike in the meroistic ovaries of D. melanogaster, in panoistic ovaries the Hippo pathway appears to regulate follicular cell proliferation by acting as a repressor of Notch, triggering the switch from mitosis to the endocycle in the follicular cells. The phylogenetically basal position of B. germanica suggests that this might be the ancestral function of Hippo in insect ovaries.",2014,"Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Paula Irles, Maria-Dolors Piulachs"

Green tea polyphenols extend the lifespan of male drosophila melanogaster while impairing reproductive fitness,25058464,10.1089/jmf.2013.0190,"Green tea is a popular beverage believed to have many health benefits, including a reduction in the risks of heart disease and cancer. Rich in polyphenolic compounds known as catechins, green tea and its components have been shown to increase the lifespan of various animal models, including Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated the gender-specific effects of green tea on the lifespan of fruit flies and observed that green tea extended the lifespan of male flies only. This effect was found to be independent of typical aging interventions, such as dietary restriction, modulation of oxidative energy metabolism, and improved tolerance to environmental stresses. The one exception was that green tea did protect male flies against iron toxicity. Since there is an inverse correlation between lifespan and reproduction, the impact of green tea on male reproductive fitness was also investigated. We found that green tea negatively impacted male fertility as shown by a reduced number of offspring produced and increased mating latency. We further identified that the lifespan extension properties of green tea was only observed in the presence of females which alludes to a reproductive (or mating) dependent mechanism. Our findings suggest that green tea extends the lifespan of male flies by inhibiting reproductive potential, possibly by limiting iron uptake. To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the negative impact of green tea on Drosophila male reproduction.

Drosophila melanogaster LRPPRC2 is involved in coordination of mitochondrial translation,25428350,10.1093/nar/gku1132,"Members of the pentatricopeptide repeat domain (PPR) protein family bind RNA and are important for post-transcriptional control of organelle gene expression in unicellular eukaryotes, metazoans and plants. They also have a role in human pathology, as mutations in the leucine-rich PPR-containing (LRPPRC) gene cause severe neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that the mammalian LRPPRC protein and its Drosophila melanogaster homolog DmLRPPRC1 (also known as bicoid stability factor) are necessary for mitochondrial translation by controlling stability and polyadenylation of mRNAs. We here report characterization of DmLRPPRC2, a second fruit fly homolog of LRPPRC, and show that it has a predominant mitochondrial localization and interacts with a stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein (DmSLIRP2). Ubiquitous downregulation of DmLrpprc2 expression causes respiratory chain dysfunction, developmental delay and shortened lifespan. Unexpectedly, decreased DmLRPPRC2 expression does not globally affect steady-state levels or polyadenylation of mitochondrial transcripts. However, some mitochondrial transcripts abnormally associate with the mitochondrial ribosomes and some products are dramatically overproduced and other ones decreased, which, in turn, results in severe deficiency of respiratory chain complexes. The function of DmLRPPRC2 thus seems to be to ensure that mitochondrial transcripts are presented to the mitochondrial ribosomes in an orderly fashion to avoid poorly coordinated translation.",2014,"Francesca Baggio, Ana Bratic, Arnaud Mourier, Timo E S Kauppila, Luke S Tain, Christian Kukat, Bianca Habermann, Linda Partridge, Nils-GÃ¶ran Larsson, Francesca Baggio, Ana Bratic, Arnaud Mourier, Timo E S Kauppila, Luke S Tain, Christian Kukat, Bianca Habermann, Linda Partridge, Nils-GÃ¶ran Larsson"
Cell-nonautonomous effects of dFOXO/DAF-16 in aging,24508462,10.1016/j.celrep.2014.01.015,"Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans each carry a single representative of the Forkhead box O (FoxO) family of transcription factors, dFOXO and DAF-16, respectively.

Alternatively, FoxOs may promote longevity cell nonautonomously by signaling to themselves (FoxO to FoxO) or other factors (FoxO to other) in distal tissues. Here, we show that activation of dFOXO and DAF-16 in the gut/fat body does not require dfoxo/daf-16 elsewhere to extend lifespan. Rather, in Drosophila, activation of dFOXO in the gut/fat body or in neuroendocrine cells acts on other organs to promote healthy aging by signaling to other, as-yet-unidentified factors.

Temporal variation favors the evolution of generalists in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster,24152128,10.1111/evo.12296,"In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that maintain fitness across a range of conditions.

We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity.

Azadirachtin blocks the calcium channel and modulates the cholinergic miniature synaptic current in the central nervous system of Drosophila,24002996,10.1002/ps.3644,"Background:
      
    

    
      Azadirachtin is a botanical pesticide, which possesses conspicuous biological actions such as insecticidal, anthelmintic, antifeedancy, antimalarial effects as well as insect growth regulation. Deterrent for chemoreceptor functions appears to be the main mechanism involved in the potent biological actions of Azadirachtin, although the cytotoxicity and subtle changes to skeletal muscle physiology may also contribute to its insecticide responses. In order to discover the effects of Azadirachtin on the central nervous system (CNS), patch-clamp recording was applied to Drosophila melanogaster, which has been widely used in neurological research.

Geneswitch was activated by feeding the steroid RU486, to the flies. We used an aversive classical conditioning paradigm to quantify memory and measures of activity to infer sleep. Immune stimulated flies exhibited reduced levels of sleep, which could not be explained by a generalised increase in waking activity.

Although these chemicals, when used as preservatives, are thought to be safe for humans, many studies have demonstrated that they have estrogenic effects, and can affect the normal development and functions of the reproductive systems in a number of animal species. By treating fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) with EP, here we show that lower concentration of EP (0.02%) enhanced fertility while higher concentration of EP (0.10% and 0.20%) shortened the lifespan and reduced the fecundity of fruit flies. When we analyzed the expression levels of the estrogen-related receptor gene (ERR), ecdysone receptor gene (EcR) and Yolk protein receptor gene (YPR) from control and EP-treated fruit flies by using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that the expression levels of all three genes were significantly changed by EP treatment, and that female fruit flies are more sensitive to EP than males. Our data suggests that the estrogenic and the toxic effects of EP to fruit flies may have a molecular basis through the hormonal effect of EP.",2014,"Ting Liu, Yajuan Li, Xiaojun Zhao, Min Zhang, Wei Gu, Ting Liu, Yajuan Li, Xiaojun Zhao, Min Zhang, Wei Gu"
Peroxisomes are required for lipid metabolism and muscle function in Drosophila melanogaster,24945818,10.1371/journal.pone.0100213,"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles that perform lipid and reactive oxygen species metabolism. Defects in peroxisome biogenesis cause peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs). The most severe PBD, Zellweger syndrome, is characterized in part by neuronal dysfunction, craniofacial malformations, and low muscle tone (hypotonia). These devastating diseases lack effective therapies and the development of animal models may reveal new drug targets. We have generated Drosophila mutants with impaired peroxisome biogenesis by disrupting the early peroxin gene pex3, which participates in budding of pre-peroxisomes from the ER and peroxisomal membrane protein localization. pex3 deletion mutants lack detectible peroxisomes and die before or during pupariation. At earlier stages of development, larvae lacking Pex3 display reduced size and impaired lipid metabolism. Selective loss of peroxisomes in muscles impairs muscle function and results in flightless animals. Although, hypotonia in PBD patients is thought to be a secondary effect of neuronal dysfunction, our results suggest that peroxisome loss directly affects muscle physiology, possibly by disrupting energy metabolism. Understanding the role of peroxisomes in Drosophila physiology, specifically in muscle cells may reveal novel aspects of PBD etiology.",2014,"Joseph E Faust, Arvind Manisundaram, Pavlina T Ivanova, Stephen B Milne, James B Summerville, H Alex Brown, Michael Wangler, Michael Stern, James A McNew, Joseph E Faust, Arvind Manisundaram, Pavlina T Ivanova, Stephen B Milne, James B Summerville, H Alex Brown, Michael Wangler, Michael Stern, James A McNew"
Identification of genes involved in the biology of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours using Drosophila melanogaster,24892285,10.1038/ncomms5005,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours (AT/RT) are malignant brain tumours. Unlike most other human brain tumours, AT/RT are characterized by inactivation of one single gene, SMARCB1. SMARCB1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, which has an important role in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. Little is known, however, about the pathways involved in the oncogenic effects of SMARCB1 inactivation, which might also represent targets for treatment. Here we report a comprehensive genetic screen in the fruit fly that revealed several genes not yet associated with loss of snr1, the Drosophila homologue of SMARCB1. We confirm the functional role of identified genes (including merlin, kibra and expanded, known to regulate hippo signalling pathway activity) in human rhabdoid tumour cell lines and AT/RT tumour samples.

"Hexameric GFP and mCherry reporters for the Drosophila GAL4, Q, and LexA transcription systems",24451596,10.1534/genetics.113.161141,"The ability to distinguish cells and tissues of interest is critical for understanding their biological importance. In genetic model organisms, a prominent approach for discerning particular cells or tissues from others is the use of cell or tissue-specific enhancers to drive fluorescent reporters. This approach, however, is often limited by the brightness of the fluorescent reporter. To augment the ability to visualize cells or tissues of interest in Drosophila melanogaster, homo-hexameric GFP and mCherry reporters were developed for the GAL4, Q, and LexA transcription systems and functionally validated in vivo. The GFP and mCherry homo-hexameric fusion proteins exhibited significantly enhanced fluorescence as compared to monomeric fluorescent reporters and could be visualized by direct fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm of neurons, including the fine processes of axons and dendrites. These high-sensitivity fluorescent reporters of cell morphology can be utilized for a variety of purposes, especially facilitating fluorescence-based genetic screens for cell morphology phenotypes. These results suggest that the strategy of fusing monomeric fluorescent proteins in tandem to enhance brightness should be generalizable to other fluorescent proteins and other genetic model organisms.",2014,"Harold K Shearin, Ian S Macdonald, Laura P Spector, R Steven Stowers, Harold K Shearin, Ian S Macdonald, Laura P Spector, R Steven Stowers"
A small system--high-resolution study of metabolic adaptation in the central metabolic pathway to temperate climates in Drosophila melanogaster,24770333,10.1093/molbev/msu146,"In this article, we couple the geographic variation in 127 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies in genes of 46 enzymes of central metabolism with their associated cis-expression variation to predict latitudinal or climatic-driven gene expression changes in the metabolic architecture of Drosophila melanogaster. Forty-two percent of the SNPs in 65% of the genes show statistically significant clines in frequency with latitude across the 20 local population samples collected from southern Florida to Ontario. A number of SNPs in the screened genes are also associated with significant expression variation within the Raleigh population from North Carolina. A principal component analysis of the full variance-covariance matrix of latitudinal changes in SNP-associated standardized gene expression allows us to identify those major genes in the pathway and its associated branches that are likely targets of natural selection. When embedded in a central metabolic context, we show that these apparent targets are concentrated in the genes of the upper glycolytic pathway and pentose shunt, those controlling glycerol shuttle activity, and finally those enzymes associated with the utilization of glutamate and pyruvate. These metabolites possess high connectivity and thus may be the points where flux balance can be best shifted. We also propose that these points are conserved points associated with coupling energy homeostasis and energy sensing in mammals. We speculate that the modulation of gene expression at specific points in central metabolism that are associated with shifting flux balance or possibly energy-state sensing plays a role in adaptation to climatic variation.",2014,"Erik Lavington, Rodrigo Cogni, Caitlin Kuczynski, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes, Erik Lavington, Rodrigo Cogni, Caitlin Kuczynski, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes"
The deleterious effects of high inbreeding on male Drosophila melanogaster attractiveness are observed under competitive but not under non-competitive conditions,24413901,10.1007/s10519-013-9639-1,"In order for the male courtship traits to honestly signal quality they need to be condition-dependent. Moreover, if these traits capture genetic variation in condition they should resemble life-history traits in being subject to strong directional selection and, consequently, suffer strong inbreeding depression. In this study we investigated the effect of high inbreeding on male attractiveness by assessing mating success, mating speed and copulation duration of inbred, outbred and crossbred (constructed by crossing separate, randomly chosen inbred lines) males of Drosophila melanogaster. When set to compete against a standardized competitor and compared to the success rate of the crossbred lines, inbreeding significantly reduced male mating success. Under competition, outbred males initiated copulation significantly sooner than crossbred and inbred males. Under non-competitive conditions, no effect of inbreeding was found on either mating speed or copulation duration. Both mating success and mating speed showed much higher inbreeding depression than male size.",2014,"Terhi M Valtonen, Derek A Roff, Markus J Rantala, Terhi M Valtonen, Derek A Roff, Markus J Rantala"
Experimental evolution of female traits under different levels of intersexual conflict in Drosophila melanogaster,24117169,10.1111/evo.12271,"A number of studies have documented the evolution of female resistance to mate-harm in response to the alteration of intersexual conflict in the populations. However, the life-history consequence of such evolution is still a subject of debate. In this study, we subjected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different levels of sexual conflict (generated by altering the operational sex ratio) for over 45 generations. Our results suggest that females from populations experiencing higher level of intersexual conflict evolved increased resistance to mate-harm, in terms of both longevity and progeny production. Females from the populations with low conflict were significantly heavier at eclosion and were more susceptible to mate-harm in terms of progeny production under continuous exposure to the males. However, these females produced more progeny upon single mating and had significantly higher longevity in absence of any male exposure-a potential evidence of trade-offs between resistance-related traits and other life-history traits, such as fecundity and longevity.

Affinity-based isolation of tagged nuclei from Drosophila tissues for gene expression analysis,24686501,10.3791/51418,"Drosophila melanogaster embryonic and larval tissues often contain a highly heterogeneous mixture of cell types, which can complicate the analysis of gene expression in these tissues. Thus, to analyze cell-specific gene expression profiles from Drosophila tissues, it may be necessary to isolate specific cell types with high purity and at sufficient yields for downstream applications such as transcriptional profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation. However, the irregular cellular morphology in tissues such as the central nervous system, coupled with the rare population of specific cell types in these tissues, can pose challenges for traditional methods of cell isolation such as laser microdissection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Here, an alternative approach to characterizing cell-specific gene expression profiles using affinity-based isolation of tagged nuclei, rather than whole cells, is described. Nuclei in the specific cell type of interest are genetically labeled with a nuclear envelope-localized EGFP tag using the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. These EGFP-tagged nuclei can be isolated using antibodies against GFP that are coupled to magnetic beads. The approach described in this protocol enables consistent isolation of nuclei from specific cell types in the Drosophila larval central nervous system at high purity and at sufficient levels for expression analysis, even when these cell types comprise less than 2% of the total cell population in the tissue. This approach can be used to isolate nuclei from a wide variety of Drosophila embryonic and larval cell types using specific Gal4 drivers, and may be useful for isolating nuclei from cell types that are not suitable for FACS or laser microdissection.",2014,"Jingqun Ma, Vikki Marie Weake, Jingqun Ma, Vikki Marie Weake"
A normative theory of forgetting: lessons from the fruit fly,24901935,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003640,"Recent experiments revealed that the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a dedicated mechanism for forgetting: blocking the G-protein Rac leads to slower and activating Rac to faster forgetting. This active form of forgetting lacks a satisfactory functional explanation. We investigated optimal decision making for an agent adapting to a stochastic environment where a stimulus may switch between being indicative of reward or punishment. Like Drosophila, an optimal agent shows forgetting with a rate that is linked to the time scale of changes in the environment. Moreover, to reduce the odds of missing future reward, an optimal agent may trade the risk of immediate pain for information gain and thus forget faster after aversive conditioning. A simple neuronal network reproduces these features. Our theory shows that forgetting in Drosophila appears as an optimal adaptive behavior in a changing environment. This is in line with the view that forgetting is adaptive rather than a consequence of limitations of the memory system.",2014,"Johanni Brea, Robert Urbanczik, Walter Senn, Johanni Brea, Robert Urbanczik, Walter Senn"
Functional analysis of the glycogen binding subunit CG9238/Gbs-70E of protein phosphatase 1 in Drosophila melanogaster,24727027,10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.04.002,"The product of the CG9238 gene that we termed glycogen binding subunit 70E (Gbs-70E) was characterized by biochemical and molecular genetics methods. The interaction between Gbs-70E and all catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (Pp1-87B, Pp1-9C, Pp1-96A and Pp1-13C) of Drosophila melanogaster was confirmed by pairwise yeast two-hybrid tests, co-immunoprecipitation and pull down experiments. The binding of Gbs-70E to glycogen was demonstrated by sedimentation analysis. With RT-PCR we found that the mRNAs coding for the longer Gbs-70E PB/PC protein were expressed in all developmental stages of the fruit flies while the mRNA for the shorter Gbs-70E PA was restricted to the eggs and the ovaries of the adult females. The development specific expression of the shorter splice variant was not conserved in different Drosophila species. The expression level of the gene was manipulated by P-element insertions and gene deletion to analyze the functions of the gene product. A small or moderate reduction in the gene expression resulted in no significant changes, however, a deletion mutant expressing very low level of the transcript lived shorter and exhibited reduced glycogen content in the imagos. In addition, the gene deletion decreased the fertility of the fruit flies.

In this study, Drosophila melanogaster adults were fed on diets supplemented or not with live yeast. We hypothesized that manipulating nutritional conditions through live yeast supplementation would translate into altered physiology and stress tolerance. We verified how live yeast supplementation affected body mass characteristics, total lipids and proteins, metabolic profiles and cold tolerance (acute and chronic stress). Females fed with live yeast had increased body mass and contained more lipids and proteins. Using GC/MS profiling, we found distinct metabolic fingerprints according to nutritional conditions. Metabolite pathway enrichment analysis corroborated that live yeast supplementation was associated with amino acid and protein biosyntheses.

Courtship song does not increase the rate of adaptation to a thermally stressful environment in a Drosophila melanogaster laboratory population,25365209,10.1371/journal.pone.0111148,"Courtship song in D. melanogaster contributes substantially to male mating success through female selection.

We used non-displaying, outbred populations of D. melanogaster (nub1) mutants and measured their rate of adaptation to a new, thermally stressful environment, relative to wild-type control populations that retained courtship song. This design retains sexually selected conflict in both treatments. Thermal stress should select across genomes for newly beneficial alleles, increasing the available genetic and phenotypic variation and, therefore, the magnitude of female benefit derived from courtship song. Following introduction to the thermally stressful environment, net reproductive rate decreased 50% over four generations, and then increased 19% over the following 16 generations.

Furthermore, we show that crm European and African natural variants shift the reaction norms of plastic traits.

Consumption of bitter alkaloids in Drosophila melanogaster in multiple-choice test conditions,21173029,10.1093/chemse/bjq133,"Drosophila melanogaster adapt their food consumption to their internal needs and avoid ingesting noxious molecules. Defects in the genes involved in these decisions induce behavioral alterations that are usually screened by monitoring flies feeding in 2-choice or in no-choice situations. Here, we introduce a new behavioral test in which groups of flies are given access to 6 capillary feeders (MultiCAFE) containing fructose mixed with a serial dilution of a test substance. Using quinine, we first showed that fly density, distance between capillaries, and order of presentation have a minor impact on the discrimination performances of the flies. Fly discrimination was also only marginally affected by the type of test (no-choice, binary, or multiple-choice). Interestingly, the feeding reduction was well correlated with a reduction of the firing elicited by the mixture in sugar-sensitive gustatory receptor neurons, suggesting that several mechanisms concur to allow flies to make their choices. In addition to quinine, flies exhibited marked dose-dependent aversions to the consumption of berberine, caffeine, lobeline, nicotine, papaverine, strychnine, and theophylline, which all taste bitter to humans. Thus, despite of the multiplicity of choices available, flies consistently avoid alkaloids mixed with a sugar solution, and their choices are strongly dependent on their taste system. The MultiCAFE assay represents an interesting alternative to other feeding tests, in that it allows monitoring of the absolute consumption while also requiring less flies and time to run than other assays.",2011,"Marie-Jeanne Sellier, Pablo Reeb, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Marion-Poll, Marie-Jeanne Sellier, Pablo Reeb, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Marion-Poll"

Mitochondrial polymorphism had few effects on nuclear gene expression in females but major effects in males, modifying nearly 10% of transcripts.

Despite being efficient vectors for HAT transmission, the prevalence of G. morsitans infection by trypanosomes in the wild is surprisingly minimal. The precise mechanisms by which G. morsitans remain refractory to trypanosome infection are largely unknown although it has been demonstrated that G. morsitans mounts a strong immune response to invading pathogens. This study identifies G. morsitans immune-related CLIP domain serine proteases and their inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors (serpin) genes.

Multiple sequence alignments show conservation of most secondary structure elements for both CLIPs and serpins. Amino acid composition of the serpin reactive site loop (RSL) indicates that the G. morsitans serpins act through an inhibitory mechanism to the target serine protease. Similar to D. melanogaster and unlike A. gambiae, the transcriptome data suggest that G. morsitans does not contain gene expansions in their CLIP-domain serine protease and serpin families.

Also, a 714-bp region structured in 5.0 tandem repeats of 143 bp each was found in the 5'UTR of the degenerate element; these could interact with transcription factor CF2. Phylogenetic analysis and alignment of amino acids indicated that the Pifo_I element was closer to the ZAM retrotransposon, which gave us some clues to their functional similarity.

At higher concentrations, however, (-)-cubebin was found to potentiate the effects of DXR, leading to either an increase in the production of mutant spots or a reduction, due to toxicity. These results suggest that depending on the concentration, (-)-cubebin may interact with the enzymatic system that catalyzes the metabolic detoxification of DXR, inhibiting the activity of mitochondrial complex I and thereby scavenging free radicals. Recombination was found to be the major effect of the treatments with DXR alone.

Common motifs shared by conserved enhancers of Drosophila midline glial genes,21154525,10.1002/jez.b.21382,"Coding sequences are usually the most highly conserved sectors of DNA, but genomic regions controlling the expression pattern of certain genes can also be conserved across diverse species. In this study, we identify five enhancers capable of activating transcription in the midline glia of Drosophila melanogaster and each contains sequences conserved across at least 11 Drosophila species. In addition, the conserved sequences contain reiterated motifs for binding sites of the known midline transcriptional activators, Single-minded, Tango, Dichaete, and Pointed. To understand the molecular basis for the highly conserved genomic subregions within enhancers of the midline genes, we tested the ability of various motifs to affect midline expression, both individually and in combination, within synthetic reporter constructs. Multiple copies of the binding site for the midline regulators Single-minded and Tango can drive expression in midline cells; however, small changes to the sequences flanking this transcription factor binding site can inactivate expression in midline cells and activate expression in tracheal cells instead. For the midline genes described in this study, the highly conserved sequences appear to juxtapose positive and negative regulatory factors in a configuration that activates genes specifically in the midline glia, while maintaining them inactive in other tissues, including midline neurons and tracheal cells.",2011,"Eric Fulkerson, Patricia Ann Estes, Eric Fulkerson, Patricia Ann Estes"

Ubiquitin over-expression phenotypes and ubiquitin gene molecular misreading during aging in Drosophila melanogaster,21415465,10.18632/aging.100278,"Molecular Misreading (MM) is the inaccurate conversion of genomic information into aberrant proteins. For example, when RNA polymerase II transcribes a GAGAG motif it synthesizes at low frequency RNA with a two-base deletion. If the deletion occurs in a coding region, translation will result in production of misframed proteins. During mammalian aging, misframed versions of human amyloid precursor protein (hApp) and ubiquitin (hUbb) accumulate in the aggregates characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting dysfunctional degradation or clearance. Here cDNA clones encoding wild-type hUbb and the frame-shifted version hUbb(+1) were expressed in transgenic Drosophila using the doxycycline-regulated system. Misframed proteins were abundantly produced, both from the transgenes and from endogenous Drosophila ubiquitin-encoding genes, and their abundance increased during aging in whole-fly extracts. Over-expression of wild-type hUbb, but not hUbb(+1), was toxic during fly development. In contrast, when over-expressed specifically in adult flies, hUbb(+1) caused small decreases in life span, whereas hUbb was associated with small increases, preferentially in males. The data suggest that MM occurs in Drosophila and that the resultant misframed proteins accumulate with age. MM of the ubiquitin gene can produce alternative ubiquitin gene products with different and sometimes opposing phenotypic effects.",2011,"Nicholas Hoe, Chung M Huang, Gary Landis, Marian Verhage, Daniel Ford, Junsheng Yang, Fred W van Leeuwen, John Tower, Nicholas Hoe, Chung M Huang, Gary Landis, Marian Verhage, Daniel Ford, Junsheng Yang, Fred W van Leeuwen, John Tower"
Bcl-2 proteins and autophagy regulate mitochondrial dynamics during programmed cell death in the Drosophila ovary,21177345,10.1242/dev.057943,"The Bcl-2 family has been shown to regulate mitochondrial dynamics during cell death in mammals and C. elegans, but evidence for this in Drosophila has been elusive. Here, we investigate the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics during germline cell death in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary. We find that mitochondria undergo a series of events during the progression of cell death, with remodeling, cluster formation and uptake of clusters by somatic follicle cells. These mitochondrial dynamics are dependent on caspases, the Bcl-2 family, the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery, and the autophagy machinery. Furthermore, Bcl-2 family mutants show a striking defect in cell death in the ovary.

Epithelial delamination and migration: lessons from Drosophila,21836393,10.4161/cam.5.4.17524,"Metastasis is the most deadly phase of cancer progression, during which cells detach from their original niche to invade distant tissues, yet the biological processes underlying the spread of cancer are still poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides important insights in our understanding of how epithelial cells migrate from their original location and find their way into surrounding and distant tissues in the metastatic process. Here we review recent studies on the mechanisms of migration of embryonic haemocytes, the macrophage-like immuno-surveillance cells, during normal development and wound healing. We highlight the interesting finding that hydrogen peroxide (H?O?? has been identified as the driving force for haemocyte chemotaxis. We also give a special emphasis to studies suggesting the concept that haemocytes, together with the tumor microenvironment, act as potential inducers of the epithelial de-lamination required for tumor invasion.

Getting real with real-time qPCR: a case study of reference gene selection for morphological variation in Drosophila melanogaster wings,21509536,10.1007/s00427-011-0356-6,"Accurate estimation of gene expression differences during development requires sensitive techniques combined with gold-standard normalization procedures. This is particularly true in the case of quantitative traits, where expression changes might be small. Nevertheless, systematic selection and validation of reference genes has been overlooked, even in Drosophila studies. Here, we tested the stability of six traditional reference genes across samples of imaginal wing disks from morphologically divergent strains of Drosophila melanogaster, in a two-class comparison: quantitative or qualitative variation in wing morphology. Overall, we identified and validated a pair of genes (RpL32 and Tbp) as being stably expressed in both experimental comparisons. These genes might be considered as a bona fide pair of reference genes for gene expression analyses of morphological divergence in D. melanogaster wings. They might also be taken as good candidates for experimental identification of stable reference genes in other morphological comparisons using Drosophila or other insect species. Besides, we found that some genes traditionally used as reference in qPCR experiments were not stably expressed in wing disks from the different fly strains. In fact, a significant bias was observed when the expression of three genes of interest, which are involved in the regulation of growth and patterning during imaginal wing development, was normalized with such putative reference genes. Our results demonstrate how inaccurate findings and opposite conclusions might be drawn if traditional reference genes are arbitrarily used for internal normalization without proper validation in the given experimental condition, a practice still common in qPCR experiments.",2011,"Bruna P Matta, Blanche C Bitner-MathÃ©, Marcio Alves-Ferreira, Bruna P Matta, Blanche C Bitner-MathÃ©, Marcio Alves-Ferreira"
An automated paradigm for Drosophila visual psychophysics,21738736,10.1371/journal.pone.0021619,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mutations that cause learning and memory defects in Drosophila melanogaster have been found to also compromise visual responsiveness and attention. A better understanding of attention-like defects in such Drosophila mutants therefore requires a more detailed characterization of visual responsiveness across a range of visual parameters.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We designed an automated behavioral paradigm for efficiently dissecting visual responsiveness in Drosophila. Populations of flies walk through multiplexed serial choice mazes while being exposed to moving visuals displayed on computer monitors, and infra-red fly counters at the end of each maze automatically score the responsiveness of a strain. To test our new design, we performed a detailed comparison between wild-type flies and a learning and memory mutant, dunce(1). We first confirmed that the learning mutant dunce(1) displays increased responsiveness to a black/green moving grating compared to wild type in this new design. We then extended this result to explore responses to a wide range of psychophysical parameters for moving gratings (e.g., luminosity, contrast, spatial frequency, velocity) as well as to a different stimulus, moving dots. Finally, we combined these visuals (gratings versus dots) in competition to investigate how dunce(1) and wild-type flies respond to more complex and conflicting motion effects.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      We found that dunce(1) responds more strongly than wild type to high contrast and highly structured motion. This effect was found for simple gratings, dots, and combinations of both stimuli presented in competition.",2011,"Oliver Evans, Angelique C Paulk, Bruno van Swinderen, Oliver Evans, Angelique C Paulk, Bruno van Swinderen"
A method for inferring the rate of occurrence and fitness effects of advantageous mutations,21954160,10.1534/genetics.111.131730,"The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations is of fundamental importance in evolutionary genetics. Recently, methods have been developed for inferring the DFE that use information from the allele frequency distributions of putatively neutral and selected nucleotide polymorphic variants in a population sample. Here, we extend an existing maximum-likelihood method that estimates the DFE under the assumption that mutational effects are unconditionally deleterious, by including a fraction of positively selected mutations. We allow one or more classes of positive selection coefficients in the model and estimate both the fraction of mutations that are advantageous and the strength of selection acting on them. We show by simulations that the method is capable of recovering the parameters of the DFE under a range of conditions. We apply the method to two data sets on multiple protein-coding genes from African populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We use a probabilistic reconstruction of the ancestral states of the polymorphic sites to distinguish between derived and ancestral states at polymorphic nucleotide sites. In both data sets, we see a significant improvement in the fit when a category of positively selected amino acid mutations is included, but no further improvement if additional categories are added. We estimate that between 1% and 2% of new nonsynonymous mutations in D. melanogaster are positively selected, with a scaled selection coefficient representing the product of the effective population size, N(e), and the strength of selection on heterozygous carriers of ??.5.",2011,"Adrian Schneider, Brian Charlesworth, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley, Adrian Schneider, Brian Charlesworth, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D Keightley"
Interspecific Y chromosome introgressions disrupt testis-specific gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes in Drosophila,21969588,10.1073/pnas.1114690108,"The Drosophila Y chromosome is a degenerated, heterochromatic chromosome with few functional genes. Nonetheless, natural variation on the Y chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster has substantial trans-acting effects on the regulation of X-linked and autosomal genes. However, the contribution of Y chromosome divergence to gene expression divergence between species is unknown. In this study, we constructed a series of Y chromosome introgression lines, in which Y chromosomes from either Drosophila sechellia or Drosophila simulans are introgressed into a common D. simulans genetic background. Using these lines, we compared genome-wide gene expression and male reproductive phenotypes between heterospecific and conspecific Y chromosomes. We find significant differences in expression for 122 genes, or 2.84% of all genes analyzed. Genes down-regulated in males with heterospecific Y chromosomes are significantly biased toward testis-specific expression patterns. These same lines show reduced fecundity and sperm competitive ability. Taken together, these results imply a significant role for Y/X and Y/autosome interactions in maintaining proper expression of male-specific genes, either directly or via indirect effects on male reproductive tissue development or function.",2011,"Timothy B Sackton, Horacio Montenegro, Daniel L Hartl, Bernardo Lemos, Timothy B Sackton, Horacio Montenegro, Daniel L Hartl, Bernardo Lemos"
Genotoxic effects of two nickel-compounds in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21073980,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.10.008,"In view of the scarcely available information on the in vivo mutagenic and co-mutagenic activity of nickel, the genotoxic potential of two nickel-compounds, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) and nickel sulphate (NiSO(4)), was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring two different genetic endpoints. On the one hand, we used the wing-spot assay, which is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of two suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larval cells. On the other hand, the in vivo comet assay, which detects single- and double-strand DNA breaks, was also used with larval haemocytes. These cells offer several advantages: they are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, the sampling and processing methodologies are quite simple and the level of basal DNA damage is relatively low. No significant increases in the frequencies of the three categories of mutant spots (i.e. small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots) were observed in the wing-spot assay; however, NiSO(4) induced significant dose-dependent increases in DNA damage in the comet assay. In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and NiCl(2) and NiSO(4) showed a slight but significant increase in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone, indicating that both nickel compounds have a synergistic interaction. These results support the assumption that both nickel compounds could act as co-mutagens interfering with DNA-repair processes and that the in vivo comet assay is a sensitive and effective method for detecting the DNA damage induced by NiSO(4) in haemocytes of D. melanogaster.",2011,"Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos, Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos"

These findings provide an opportunity to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of this disorder through the creation and analysis of appropriate genetic models. One model system that has proven surprisingly tractable for these studies is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of a number of Drosophila models of PD has revealed some profound and sometimes surprising insights into PD pathogenesis. Moreover, these models can be used to investigate potential therapeutic strategies that may be effective in vivo, and tests have highlighted the efficacy of a number of neuroprotective compounds.

The BAR domain protein PICK1 regulates cell recognition and morphogenesis by interacting with Neph proteins,21690291,10.1128/MCB.05286-11,"Neph proteins are evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily that control the formation of specific intercellular contacts. Cell recognition through these proteins is essential in diverse cellular contexts such as patterning of the compound eye in Drosophila melanogaster, neuronal connectivity in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the formation of the kidney filtration barrier in mammals. Here we identify the PDZ and BAR domain protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C-kinase 1) as a Neph-interacting protein. Binding required dimerization of PICK1, was dependent on PDZ domain protein interactions, and mediated stabilization of Neph1 at the plasma membrane. Moreover, protein kinase C (PKCÎ±) activity facilitated the interaction through releasing Neph proteins from their binding to the multidomain scaffolding protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), another PDZ domain protein. In Drosophila, the Neph homologue Roughest is essential for sorting of interommatidial precursor cells and patterning of the compound eye.

After a pre-management period such that one of the four subpopulations had higher inbreeding and differentiation than the others, three management methods were compared for 10 generations over three replicates: (1) isolated subpopulations (IS), (2) one-migrant-per-generation rule (OMPG), (3) DM aimed to produce the same or lower inbreeding coefficient than OMPG. The DM produced the lowest co-ancestry and equal or lower inbreeding than the OMPG method throughout the experiment. The initially lower fitness and lower variation for nine microsatellite loci of the highly inbred subpopulation were restored more quickly with the DM than with the OMPG method.

Using both empirical biochemical and predictive bioinformatic approaches, we show that the regulatory elements of one allele are capable of interacting in trans with, and modifying the expression of, the second allele. Furthermore, we show that nonlocal factors--different genetic backgrounds--are capable of significant interactions with individual Men alleles, suggesting that these trans-effects can be modified by both locally and distantly acting elements.

We show that orally ingested P. aeruginosa crosses the intestinal barrier and then proliferates in the hemolymph, thereby causing the infected flies to die of bacteremia. Host defenses against ingested P. aeruginosa included an immune deficiency (IMD) response in the intestinal epithelium, systemic Toll and IMD pathway responses, and a cellular immune response controlling bacteria in the hemocoel. Although the observed cellular and intestinal immune responses appeared to act throughout the course of the infection, there was a late onset of the systemic IMD and Toll responses. In this oral infection model, P. aeruginosa PA14 did not require its type III secretion system or other well-studied virulence factors such as the two-component response regulator GacA or the protease AprA for virulence. In contrast, the quorum-sensing transcription factor RhlR, but surprisingly not LasR, played a key role in counteracting the cellular immune response against PA14, possibly at an early stage when only a few bacteria are present in the hemocoel.

Surprisingly, deletion of the sole abundant Obp in these sensilla does not reduce the magnitude of their olfactory responses.

A robust (re-)annotation approach to generate unbiased mapping references for RNA-seq-based analyses of differential expression across closely related species,27220689,10.1186/s12864-016-2646-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      RNA-seq based on short reads generated by next generation sequencing technologies has become the main approach to study differential gene expression. Until now, the main applications of this technique have been to study the variation of gene expression in a whole organism, tissue or cell type under different conditions or at different developmental stages. However, RNA-seq also has a great potential to be used in evolutionary studies to investigate gene expression divergence in closely related species.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We show that the published genomes and annotations of the three closely related Drosophila species D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana have limitations for inter-specific gene expression studies. This is due to missing gene models in at least one of the genome annotations, unclear orthology assignments and significant gene length differences in the different species. A comprehensive evaluation of four statistical frameworks (DESeq2, DESeq2 with length correction, RPKM-limma and RPKM-voom-limma) shows that none of these methods sufficiently accounts for inter-specific gene length differences, which inevitably results in false positive candidate genes. We propose that published reference genomes should be re-annotated before using them as references for RNA-seq experiments to include as many genes as possible and to account for a potential length bias. We present a straight-forward reciprocal re-annotation pipeline that allows to reliably compare the expression for nearly all genes annotated in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that our reciprocal re-annotation of previously published genomes facilitates the analysis of significantly more genes in an inter-specific differential gene expression study. We propose that the established pipeline can easily be applied to re-annotate other genomes of closely related animals and plants to improve comparative expression analyses.",2016,"Montserrat Torres-Oliva, Isabel Almudi, Alistair P McGregor, Nico Posnien, Montserrat Torres-Oliva, Isabel Almudi, Alistair P McGregor, Nico Posnien"

Confocal Analysis of Nuclear Lamina Behavior during Male Meiosis and Spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,26963718,10.1371/journal.pone.0151231,"Lamin family proteins are structural components of a filamentous framework, the nuclear lamina (NL), underlying the inner membrane of nuclear envelope. The NL not only plays a role in nucleus mechanical support and nuclear shaping, but is also involved in many cellular processes including DNA replication, gene expression and chromatin positioning. Spermatogenesis is a very complex differentiation process in which each stage is characterized by nuclear architecture dramatic changes, from the early mitotic stage to the sperm differentiation final stage. Nevertheless, very few data are present in the literature on the NL behavior during this process. Here we show the first and complete description of NL behavior during meiosis and spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. By confocal imaging, we characterized the NL modifications from mitotic stages, through meiotic divisions to sperm differentiation with an anti-laminDm0 antibody against the major component of the Drosophila NL. We observed that continuous changes in the NL structure occurred in parallel with chromatin reorganization throughout the whole process and that meiotic divisions occurred in a closed context. Finally, we analyzed NL in solofuso meiotic mutant, where chromatin segregation is severely affected, and found the strict correlation between the presence of chromatin and that of NL.",2016,"Fabiana Fabbretti, Ilaria Iannetti, Loredana Guglielmi, Susanna Perconti, Chiara Evangelistella, Luca Proietti De Santis, Silvia Bongiorni, Giorgio Prantera, Fabiana Fabbretti, Ilaria Iannetti, Loredana Guglielmi, Susanna Perconti, Chiara Evangelistella, Luca Proietti De Santis, Silvia Bongiorni, Giorgio Prantera"
Trimming of sequence reads alters RNA-Seq gene expression estimates,26911985,10.1186/s12859-016-0956-2,"Background:
      
    

    
      High-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the preferred technique for studying gene expression differences between biological samples and for discovering novel isoforms, though the techniques to analyze the resulting data are still immature. One pre-processing step that is widely but heterogeneously applied is trimming, in which low quality bases, identified by the probability that they are called incorrectly, are removed. However, the impact of trimming on subsequent alignment to a genome could influence downstream analyses including gene expression estimation; we hypothesized that this might occur in an inconsistent manner across different genes, resulting in differential bias.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To assess the effects of trimming on gene expression, we generated RNA-Seq data sets from four samples of larval Drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons, and used three trimming algorithms--SolexaQA, Trimmomatic, and ConDeTri-to perform quality-based trimming across a wide range of stringencies. After aligning the reads to the D. melanogaster genome with TopHat2, we used Cuffdiff2 to compare the original, untrimmed gene expression estimates to those following trimming. With the most aggressive trimming parameters, over ten percent of genes had significant changes in their estimated expression levels. This trend was seen with two additional RNA-Seq data sets and with alternative differential expression analysis pipelines. We found that the majority of the expression changes could be mitigated by imposing a minimum length filter following trimming, suggesting that the differential gene expression was primarily being driven by spurious mapping of short reads. Slight differences with the untrimmed data set remained after length filtering, which were associated with genes with low exon numbers and high GC content. Finally, an analysis of paired RNA-seq/microarray data sets suggests that no or modest trimming results in the most biologically accurate gene expression estimates.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We find that aggressive quality-based trimming has a large impact on the apparent makeup of RNA-Seq-based gene expression estimates, and that short reads can have a particularly strong impact. We conclude that implementation of trimming in RNA-Seq analysis workflows warrants caution, and if used, should be used in conjunction with a minimum read length filter to minimize the introduction of unpredictable changes in expression estimates.",2016,"Claire R Williams, Alyssa Baccarella, Jay Z Parrish, Charles C Kim, Claire R Williams, Alyssa Baccarella, Jay Z Parrish, Charles C Kim"

In vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of mitochondria-targeted peptide in Drosophila melanogaster with trauma-induced thoracic injury,26648055,10.3892/ijmm.2015.2426,"Trauma is the most common cause of mortality among individuals aged between 1 and 44 years and the third leading cause of mortality overall in the US. In this study, we examined the effects of trauma on the expression of genes in Drosophila melanogaster, a useful model for investigating genetics and physiology. After trauma was induced by a non-lethal needle puncture of the thorax, we observed the differential expression of genes encoding for mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, as well as those encoding for apoptosis-related and insulin signaling-related proteins, thus indicating muscle functional dysregulation. These results prompted us to examine the link between insulin signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction using in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with complementary electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Trauma significantly increased insulin resistance biomarkers, and the NMR spectral profile of the aged flies with trauma-induced thoracic injury resembled that of insulin-resistant chico mutant flies. In addition, the mitochondrial redox status, as measured by EPR, was significantly altered following trauma, indicating mitochondrial uncoupling. A mitochondria-targeted compound, Szeto-Schiller (SS)-31 that promotes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis normalized the NMR spectral profile, as well as the mitochondrial redox status of the flies with trauma-induced thoracic injury, as assessed by EPR. Based on these findings, we propose a molecular mechanism responsible for trauma-related mortality and also propose that trauma sequelae in aging are linked to insulin signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Factors underlying natural variation in body pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster,27021917,10.1266/ggs.15-00061,"Molecular mechanisms underlying standing genetic variation of an ecologically relevant trait such as pigmentation trait variation in a model insect, Drosophila melanogaster, are relevant to our understanding of different kinds of intergenomic interactions. In this study, we focused on the association between body pigmentation and stress resistance, and on genotype-by-environment interaction, both of which are likely to contribute to the persistence of phenotypic variation in a natural population. First, we detected a significant association between pigmentation traits in females and starvation resistance (darker strains were weaker) and a weak association between pigmentation and chill coma recovery time (darker strains showed shorter recovery time) among 20 inbred strains from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), which originated from a natural population in North America. These associations revealed a complex relationship between body pigmentation and physiological traits that may give rise to balanced selective forces acting on the traits under fluctuating environmental conditions. Second, using four of the DGRP strains, a substantial degree of genotype (strain) ? environment (rearing temperature) interaction was detected among expression levels of the genes encoding effector enzymes in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. These interactions can potentially reduce the efficiency of purifying selection on the pigmentation traits over a wide range of temperature conditions. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of the standing pigmentation variation in this species.",2016,"Saki Sunaga, Noriyoshi Akiyama, Ryutaro Miyagi, Aya Takahashi, Saki Sunaga, Noriyoshi Akiyama, Ryutaro Miyagi, Aya Takahashi"
Life span extension by targeting a link between metabolism and histone acetylation in Drosophila,26781291,10.15252/embr.201541132,"Old age is associated with a progressive decline of mitochondrial function and changes in nuclear chromatin. However, little is known about how metabolic activity and epigenetic modifications change as organisms reach their midlife. Here, we assessed how cellular metabolism and protein acetylation change during early aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that flies increase oxygen consumption and become less sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors as they reach midlife. Further, midlife flies show changes in the metabolome, elevated acetyl-CoA levels, alterations in protein-notably histone-acetylation, as well as associated transcriptome changes. Based on these observations, we decreased the activity of the acetyl-CoA-synthesizing enzyme ATP citrate lyase (ATPCL) or the levels of the histone H4 K12-specific acetyltransferase Chameau. We find that these targeted interventions both alleviate the observed aging-associated changes and promote longevity.

"The insect central complex as model for heterochronic brain development-background, concepts, and tools",27056385,10.1007/s00427-016-0542-7,"The adult insect brain is composed of neuropils present in most taxa. However, the relative size, shape, and developmental timing differ between species. This diversity of adult insect brain morphology has been extensively described while the genetic mechanisms of brain development are studied predominantly in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it has remained enigmatic what cellular and genetic mechanisms underlie the evolution of neuropil diversity or heterochronic development. In this perspective paper, we propose a novel approach to study these questions. We suggest using genome editing to mark homologous neural cells in the fly D. melanogaster, the beetle Tribolium castaneum, and the Mediterranean field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus to investigate developmental differences leading to brain diversification. One interesting aspect is the heterochrony observed in central complex development. Ancestrally, the central complex is formed during embryogenesis (as in Gryllus) but in Drosophila, it arises during late larval and metamorphic stages. In Tribolium, it forms partially during embryogenesis. Finally, we present tools for brain research in Tribolium including 3D reconstruction and immunohistochemistry data of first instar brains and the generation of transgenic brain imaging lines.

Neurofibromin Loss of Function Drives Excessive Grooming in Drosophila,26896440,10.1534/g3.115.026484,"Neurofibromatosis I is a common genetic disorder that results in tumor formation, and predisposes individuals to a range of cognitive/behavioral symptoms, including deficits in attention, visuospatial skills, learning, language development, and sleep, and autism spectrum disorder-like traits. The nf1-encoded neurofibromin protein (Nf1) exhibits high conservation, from the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to humans. Drosophila provides a powerful platform to investigate the signaling cascades upstream and downstream of Nf1, and the fly model exhibits similar behavioral phenotypes to mammalian models. In order to understand how loss of Nf1 affects motor behavior in flies, we combined traditional activity monitoring with video analysis of grooming behavior. In nf1 mutants, spontaneous grooming was increased up to 7x. This increase in activity was distinct from previously described dopamine-dependent hyperactivity, as dopamine transporter mutants exhibited slightly decreased grooming. Finally, we found that relative grooming frequencies can be compared in standard activity monitors that measure infrared beam breaks, enabling the use of activity monitors as an automated method to screen for grooming phenotypes. Overall, these data suggest that loss of nf1 produces excessive activity that is manifested as increased grooming, providing a platform to dissect the molecular genetics of neurofibromin signaling across neuronal circuits.",2016,"Lanikea B King, Marta Koch, Keith R Murphy, Yoheilly Velazquez, William W Ja, Seth M Tomchik, Lanikea B King, Marta Koch, Keith R Murphy, Yoheilly Velazquez, William W Ja, Seth M Tomchik"
Homology modeling and molecular docking studies of Drosophila and Aedes sex peptide receptors,27060892,10.1016/j.jmgm.2016.03.014,"The Drosophila melanogaster sex peptide receptor (DrmSPR), which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is known as the specific receptor for sex peptide (SP). It is responsible for the reproductive behavior in the Drosophila model system; in particular, it is involved in the post-mating responses such as the increase in egg-laying ability and decrease in receptivity in females. In a previous study, we discovered a small molecule agonist of DrmSPR for the first time, which could not, however, activate Aedes aegypti SPR (AedesSPR). To investigate the binding mechanism of the small molecule agonist of DrmSPR, the ensemble structures of low-lying packing structures of DrmSPR and AedesSPR were assembled using the GEnSeMBLE (GPCR Ensemble of Structures in Membrane BiLayer Environment) method. The generated homology models exhibited the typical pattern of inter-helical interactions of the class A GPCRs. The docking experiments of the small molecule agonist suggest that Tyr(5.35) and Phe(2.67) residues may be involved in a hydrophobic interaction and that Ser(3.25) forms a hydrogen bond with the agonist. Additionally, we found that the docking results were consistent with the experimental data of the reference compounds with variable agonistic activities.

We find that models assuming purely unspecific or lysine site-specific acetylation rates were insufficient to explain the experimentally determined motif abundances. Rather, these abundances were best described by an ensemble of models with acetylation rates that were specific to motifs. The model ensemble converged upon four acetylation pathways; we validated three of these using independent data from a systematic enzyme depletion study.

Frazzled promotes growth cone attachment at the source of a Netrin gradient in the Drosophila visual system,27743477,10.7554/eLife.20762,"Axon guidance is proposed to act through a combination of long- and short-range attractive and repulsive cues.

In the Drosophila visual system, R8 photoreceptor growth cones were shown to require Net-Fra to reach their target, the peak of a Net gradient. Using live imaging, we show, however, that R8 growth cones reach and recognize their target without Net, Fra, or Trim9, a conserved binding partner of Fra, but do not remain attached to it. Thus, despite the graded ligand distribution along the guidance path, Net-Fra is not used for chemoattraction. Based on findings in other systems, we propose that adhesion to substrate-bound Net underlies both long- and short-range Net-Fra-dependent guidance in vivo, thereby eroding the distinction between them.",2016,"Orkun Akin, S Lawrence Zipursky, Orkun Akin, S Lawrence Zipursky"
"The Drosophila melanogaster Muc68E Mucin Gene Influences Adult Size, Starvation Tolerance, and Cold Recovery",27172221,10.1534/g3.116.029934,"Mucins have been implicated in many different biological processes, such as protection from mechanical damage, microorganisms, and toxic molecules, as well as providing a luminal scaffold during development. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that mucins have the potential to modulate food absorption as well, and thus contribute to the definition of several important phenotypic traits. Here we show that the Drosophila melanogaster Muc68E gene is 40- to 60-million-yr old, and is present in Drosophila species of the subgenus Sophophora only. The central repeat region of this gene is fast evolving, and shows evidence for repeated expansions/contractions. This and/or frequent gene conversion events lead to the homogenization of its repeats. The amino acid pattern P[ED][ED][ST][ST][ST] is found in the repeat region of Muc68E proteins from all Drosophila species studied, and can occur multiple times within a single conserved repeat block, and thus may have functional significance. Muc68E is a nonessential gene under laboratory conditions, but Muc68E mutant flies are smaller and lighter than controls at birth. However, at 4 d of age, Muc68E mutants are heavier, recover faster from chill-coma, and are more resistant to starvation than control flies, although they have the same percentage of lipids as controls. Mutant flies have enlarged abdominal size 1 d after chill-coma recovery, which is associated with higher lipid content. These results suggest that Muc68E has a role in metabolism modulation, food absorption, and/or feeding patterns in larvae and adults, and under normal and stress conditions.

Comparative evaluation of the genomes of three common Drosophila-associated bacteria,27493201,10.1242/bio.017673,"Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to explore the molecular exchanges that occur between an animal intestine and associated microbes. Previous studies in Drosophila uncovered a sophisticated web of host responses to intestinal bacteria. The outcomes of these responses define critical events in the host, such as the establishment of immune responses, access to nutrients, and the rate of larval development. Despite our steady march towards illuminating the host machinery that responds to bacterial presence in the gut, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the microbial products that influence bacterial association with a fly host. We sequenced and characterized the genomes of three common Drosophila-associated microbes: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Acetobacter pasteurianus For each species, we compared the genomes of Drosophila-associated strains to the genomes of strains isolated from alternative sources. We found that environmental Lactobacillus strains readily associated with adult Drosophila and were similar to fly isolates in terms of genome organization. In contrast, we identified a strain of A. pasteurianus that apparently fails to associate with adult Drosophila due to an inability to grow on fly nutrient food. Comparisons between association competent and incompetent A. pasteurianus strains identified a short list of candidate genes that may contribute to survival on fly medium. Many of the gene products unique to fly-associated strains have established roles in the stabilization of host-microbe interactions.

Changes in Drosophila mitochondrial proteins following chaperone-mediated lifespan extension confirm a role of Hsp22 in mitochondrial UPR and reveal a mitochondrial localization for cathepsin D,26930296,10.1016/j.mad.2016.02.011,"Hsp22 is a small mitochondrial heat shock protein (sHSP) preferentially up-regulated during aging in Drosophila melanogaster.

Hsp22 is one of the few sHSP to be localized inside mitochondria, and is the first sHSP to be involved in the mitochondrial unfolding protein response (UPR(MT)) together with Hsp60, mitochondrial Hsp70 and TRAP1. The UPR(MT) is a pro-longevity mechanism, and interestingly Hsp22 over-expression by-itself increases lifespan and resistance to stress. To unveil the effect of Hsp22 on the mitochondrial proteome, comparative IEF/SDS polyacrylamide 2D gels were done on mitochondria from Hsp22+ flies and controls. Among the proteins influenced by Hsp22 expression were proteins from the electron transport chain (ETC), the TCA cycle and mitochondrial Hsp70. Hsp22 co-migrates with ETC components and its over-expression is associated with an increase in mitochondrial protease activity. Interestingly, the only protease that showed significant changes upon Hsp22 over-expression in the comparative IEF/SDS-PAGE analysis was cathepsin D, which is localized in mitochondria in addition to lysosome in D. melanogaster as evidenced by cellular fractionation.

Mechanisms of skeletal muscle aging: insights from Drosophila and mammalian models,24092876,10.1242/dmm.012559,"A characteristic feature of aged humans and other mammals is the debilitating, progressive loss of skeletal muscle function and mass that is known as sarcopenia. Age-related muscle dysfunction occurs to an even greater extent during the relatively short lifespan of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Studies in model organisms indicate that sarcopenia is driven by a combination of muscle tissue extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and that it fundamentally differs from the rapid atrophy of muscles observed following disuse and fasting. Extrinsic changes in innervation, stem cell function and endocrine regulation of muscle homeostasis contribute to muscle aging. In addition, organelle dysfunction and compromised protein homeostasis are among the primary intrinsic causes. Some of these age-related changes can in turn contribute to the induction of compensatory stress responses that have a protective role during muscle aging.

We characterized defense traits of Drosophila when exposed to parasitoids with different host searching behaviors (Aphaereta sp. and Leptopilina boulardi). We used host larvae with different natural alleles of the gene Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc), a gene controlling the production of dopamine and known to influence the immune response against parasitoids. Previous population genetic analyses indicate that our focal alleles are maintained by balancing selection. Genotypes exhibited a trade-off between the immune response against Aphaereta sp. and the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi. We also identified a trade-off between the ability to avoid parasitism by L. boulardi and larval competitive ability as indicated by differences in foraging and feeding behavior. Genotypes differed in dopamine levels potentially explaining variation in these traits.

Insulin and Target of rapamycin signaling orchestrate the development of ovarian niche-stem cell units in Drosophila,24026119,10.1242/dev.093773,"Tissue-specific stem cells and their niches are organized into functional units that respond to external cues in order to maintain organ homeostasis. Insulin and Target of rapamycin (Tor) signaling mediate external cues that control adult niches and stem cells. Whether these pathways play a role in the establishment of niche-stem cell units during organogenesis has been little explored. We show that during larval development both Insulin-like receptor (InR) and Tor participate in the establishment of ovarian niches and germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila melanogaster. Tor and InR are required cell-autonomously for the proliferation of precursors for both somatic niches and GSCs. These pathways also promote the formation of terminal filaments (part of the somatic niche). Significantly, InR, but not Tor, signaling non-autonomously promotes primordial germ cell (PGC) differentiation. Somatic attenuation of the pathway retards PGC differentiation, whereas its activation results in their precocious differentiation. We also show that InR-mediated PGC differentiation is independent of somatic ecdysone signaling, but that further differentiation into cysts requires an ecdysone input. These results demonstrate that Tor and InR signaling actively participate in the formation of ovarian niches and stem cells by affecting both cell numbers and differentiation. The dual influence of Tor and InR on both somatic cells and PGCs ensures that these two cell populations develop coordinately. Our work further identifies a novel step in the regulation of germ cell differentiation by demonstrating that following bag of marbles expression, cyst formation requires an additional hormonal input.",2013,"Dana Gancz, Lilach Gilboa, Dana Gancz, Lilach Gilboa"
Requirement for commissureless2 function during dipteran insect nerve cord development,24026811,10.1002/dvdy.24059,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, commissureless (comm) function is required for proper nerve cord development. Although comm orthologs have not been identified outside of Drosophila species, some insects possess orthologs of Drosophila comm2, which may also regulate embryonic nerve cord development. Here, this hypothesis is explored through characterization of comm2 genes in two disease vector mosquitoes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Culex quinquefasciatus (West Nile and lymphatic filiariasis vector) has three comm2 genes that are expressed in the developing nerve cord. Aedes aegypti (dengue and yellow fever vector) has a single comm2 gene that is expressed in commissural neurons projecting axons toward the midline. Loss of comm2 function in both A. aegypti and D. melanogaster was found to result in loss of commissure defects that phenocopy the frazzled (fra) loss of function phenotypes observed in both species.

In Drosophila, the two histone methyltransferases SETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 mediate H3K9 methylation marks that initiates the establishment and spreading of HP1a-enriched chromatin. Although HP1a is generally regarded as a factor that represses gene transcription, several reports have linked HP1a binding to active genes, and in some cases, it has been shown to stimulate transcriptional activity. To clarify the function of HP1a in transcription regulation and its association with Su(var)3-9, SETDB1 and the chromosome 4-specific protein POF, we conducted genome-wide expression studies and combined the results with available binding data in Drosophila melanogaster. The results suggest that HP1a, SETDB1 and Su(var)3-9 repress genes on chromosome 4, where non-ubiquitously expressed genes are preferentially targeted, and stimulate genes in pericentromeric regions. Further, we showed that on chromosome 4, Su(var)3-9, SETDB1 and HP1a target the same genes. In addition, we found that transposons are repressed by HP1a and Su(var)3-9 and that the binding level and expression effects of HP1a are affected by gene length. Our results indicate that genes have adapted to be properly expressed in their local chromatin environment.",2013,"Lina E Lundberg, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson, Lina E Lundberg, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson"
Neuroendocrine control of Drosophila larval light preference,24009394,10.1126/science.1241210,"Animal development is coupled with innate behaviors that maximize chances of survival. Here, we show that the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a neuropeptide that controls the developmental transition from juvenile stage to sexual maturation, also regulates light avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster larvae. PTTH, through its receptor Torso, acts on two light sensors--the Bolwig's organ and the peripheral class IV dendritic arborization neurons--to regulate light avoidance. We found that PTTH concomitantly promotes steroidogenesis and light avoidance at the end of larval stage, driving animals toward a darker environment to initiate the immobile maturation phase. Thus, PTTH controls the decisions of when and where animals undergo metamorphosis, optimizing conditions for adult development.",2013,"Naoki Yamanaka, Nuria M Romero, Francisco A Martin, Kim F Rewitz, Mu Sun, Michael B O'Connor, Pierre LÃ©opold, Naoki Yamanaka, Nuria M Romero, Francisco A Martin, Kim F Rewitz, Mu Sun, Michael B O'Connor, Pierre LÃ©opold"
Functional characterization and gene expression profiling of Drosophila melanogaster short dADA2b isoform-containing dSAGA complexes,23336284,10.1186/1471-2164-14-44,"Background:
      
    

    
      ADA2 proteins, together with ADA3, SGF29 and GCN5 form the acetyltransferase module of GNAT-type histone acetyltransferase complexes. ADA2b is present in the SAGA complex, which plays roles in various chromatin-related processes via histone H3 modifications and by other mechanisms.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this report we present findings showing that during Drosophila melanogaster development two dADA2b isoforms (dADA2bS and dADA2bL) - which differ in their C-terminal domains - are expressed at various levels. Genetic complementation experiments indicate that dADA2bS alone can support development but cannot fully complement dAda2b mutations. In the presence of dADA2bS, the SAGA-specific histone H3 acetylation level is partially restored in dAda2b mutants. Comparison of whole transcriptome profiles of dAda2b null and dAda2bS transgene-carrier dAda2b null larvae indicates partial overlap between affected genes. mRNA levels corresponding to selected genes which are either up- or down-regulated in dAda2b mutants are altered by dADA2bS expression to different extents, ranging from complete restoration to wild type levels to no restoration at all. The short (dADA2bS) isoform of dADA2b seems to be more capable of restoring lost dSAGA functions that cause mRNA level up-regulation than those that lead to decreased mRNA levels.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Patterns of nucleotide diversity at the regions encompassing the Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dilp) genes: demography vs. positive selection in Drosophila melanogaster,23308258,10.1371/journal.pone.0053593,"In Drosophila, the insulin-signaling pathway controls some life history traits, such as fertility and lifespan, and it is considered to be the main metabolic pathway involved in establishing adult body size. Several observations concerning variation in body size in the Drosophila genus are suggestive of its adaptive character. Genes encoding proteins in this pathway are, therefore, good candidates to have experienced adaptive changes and to reveal the footprint of positive selection. The Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) are the ligands that trigger the insulin-signaling cascade. In Drosophila melanogaster, there are several peptides that are structurally similar to the single mammalian insulin peptide. The footprint of recent adaptive changes on nucleotide variation can be unveiled through the analysis of polymorphism and divergence. With this aim, we have surveyed nucleotide sequence variation at the dilp1-7 genes in a natural population of D. melanogaster. The comparison of polymorphism in D. melanogaster and divergence from D. simulans at different functional classes of the dilp genes provided no evidence of adaptive protein evolution after the split of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages. However, our survey of polymorphism at the dilp gene regions of D. melanogaster has provided some evidence for the action of positive selection at or near these genes. The regions encompassing the dilp1-4 genes and the dilp6 gene stand out as likely affected by recent adaptive events.",2013,"Sara Guirao-Rico, Montserrat AguadÃ©"
A fragmented alignment method detects a putative phosphorylation site and a putative BRC repeat in the Drosophila melanogaster BRCA2 protein,24627786,10.12688/f1000research.2-143.v2,"Mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein leave individuals susceptible to breast, ovarian and other cancers. The BRCA2 protein is a critical component of the DNA repair pathways in eukaryotes, and also plays an integral role in fostering genomic variability through meiotic recombination. Although present in many eukaryotes, as a whole the BRCA2 gene is weakly conserved. Conserved fragments of 30 amino acids (BRC repeats), which mediate interactions with the recombinase RAD51, helped detect orthologs of this protein in other organisms. The carboxy-terminal of the human BRCA2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by checkpoint kinases (Chk1/Chk2) at T3387, which regulate the sequestration of RAD51 on DNA damage. However, apart from three BRC repeats, the Drosophila melanogaster gene has not been annotated and associated with other functionally relevant sequence fragments in human BRCA2. In the current work, the carboxy-terminal phosphorylation threonine site (E=9.1e-4) and a new BRC repeat (E=17e-4) in D. melanogaster has been identified, using a fragmented alignment methodology (FRAGAL). In a similar study, FRAGAL has also identified a novel half-a- tetratricopeptide (HAT) motif (E=11e-4), a helical repeat motif implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, in Utp6 from yeast. The characteristic three aromatic residues with conserved spacing are observed in this new HAT repeat, further strengthening my claim. The reference and target sequences are sliced into overlapping fragments of equal parameterized lengths. All pairs of fragments in the reference and target proteins are aligned, and the gap penalties are adjusted to discourage gaps in the middle of the alignment. The results of the best matches are sorted based on differing criteria to aid the detection of known and putative sequences.

Mitochondrial DNA content of mature spermatozoa and oocytes in the genetic model Drosophila,23686567,10.1007/s00441-013-1628-4,"Although crucial to the success of fertilization and embryogenesis, little is known about the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content of mature spermatozoa and oocytes across taxa and across different fertilization systems. Oocytes are assumed to hold a large population of mtDNAs that populate emerging cells during early embryogenesis, whereas spermatozoa harbor only a limited pool of mtDNAs that is believed to sustain functionality but fails to contribute paternal mtDNA to the zygote. Recent work suggests that mature sperm of the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster lack mtDNA, questioning the significance of zygotic mechanisms for the selective elimination of paternal mtDNA and their necessity for fertilization success. This finding further contradicts previous observations of the inheritance of paternal mtDNA in drosophilids. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we estimate the mtDNA content of several laboratory strains of D. melanogaster and D. simulans to shed light on this discrepancy and to describe the mitochondrial/mtDNA load of gametes within this system. These measurements led to an average estimate of 22.91Â±4.61 mtDNA molecules/copies per spermatozoon across both species and to 1.07E+07Â±2.71E+06 molecules/copies per oocyte for D. simulans. As a consequence, the ratio of paternal and maternal mtDNA in the zygote was estimated at 1:4.65E+05.",2013,"Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Peter Sutovsky, John William Oman Ballard, Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Peter Sutovsky, John William Oman Ballard"

Fly, worm, and mice Indy gene homologs are predominantly expressed in places important for intermediary metabolism. Consequently, decreased expression of Indy in fly and worm, and the removal of mIndy in mice exhibit changes associated with calorie restriction, such as decreased levels of lipids, changes in carbohydrate metabolism and increased mitochondrial biogenesis.

Food deprivation increases the low-dose locomotor stimulant response to ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster,23994621,10.1016/j.pbb.2013.08.010,"Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains. Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence.",2013,"Christopher L Kliethermes, Christopher L Kliethermes"
"Fermitins, the orthologs of mammalian Kindlins, regulate the development of a functional cardiac syncytium in Drosophila melanogaster",23690969,10.1371/journal.pone.0062958,"The vertebrate Kindlins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins critical for integrin signalling and cell adhesion. Kindlin-2 (KIND2) is associated with intercalated discs in mice, suggesting a role in cardiac syncytium development; however, deficiency of Kind2 leads to embryonic lethality. Morpholino knock-down of Kind2 in zebrafish has a pleiotropic effect on development that includes the heart. It therefore remains unclear whether cardiomyocyte Kind2 expression is required for cardiomyocyte junction formation and the development of normal cardiac function. To address this question, the expression of Fermitin 1 and Fermitin 2 (Fit1, Fit2), the two Drosophila orthologs of Kind2, was silenced in Drosophila cardiomyocytes. Heart development was assessed in adult flies by immunological methods and videomicroscopy. Silencing both Fit1 and Fit2 led to a severe cardiomyopathy characterised by the failure of cardiomyocytes to develop as a functional syncytium and loss of synchrony between cardiomyocytes. A null allele of Fit1 was generated but this had no impact on the heart. Similarly, the silencing of Fit2 failed to affect heart function. In contrast, the silencing of Fit2 in the cardiomyocytes of Fit1 null flies disrupted syncytium development, leading to severe cardiomyopathy. The data definitively demonstrate a role for Fermitins in the development of a functional cardiac syncytium in Drosophila. The findings also show that the Fermitins can functionally compensate for each other in order to control syncytium development. These findings support the concept that abnormalities in cardiomyocyte KIND2 expression or function may contribute to cardiomyopathies in humans.",2013,"James H Catterson, Margarete M S Heck, Paul S Hartley, James H Catterson, Margarete M S Heck, Paul S Hartley"
Elevated expression of the integrin-associated protein PINCH suppresses the defects of Drosophila melanogaster muscle hypercontraction mutants,23555310,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003406,"A variety of human diseases arise from mutations that alter muscle contraction. Evolutionary conservation allows genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster to be used to better understand these myopathies and suggest novel therapeutic strategies. Integrin-mediated adhesion is required to support muscle structure and function, and expression of Integrin adhesive complex (IAC) proteins is modulated to adapt to varying levels of mechanical stress within muscle. Mutations in flapwing (flw), a catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase, result in non-muscle myosin hyperphosphorylation, as well as muscle hypercontraction, defects in size, motility, muscle attachment, and subsequent larval and pupal lethality. We find that moderately elevated expression of the IAC protein PINCH significantly rescues flw phenotypes. Rescue requires PINCH be bound to its partners, Integrin-linked kinase and Ras suppressor 1. Rescue is not achieved through dephosphorylation of non-muscle myosin, suggesting a mechanism in which elevated PINCH expression strengthens integrin adhesion. In support of this, elevated expression of PINCH rescues an independent muscle hypercontraction mutant in muscle myosin heavy chain, Mhc(Samba1). By testing a panel of IAC proteins, we show specificity for PINCH expression in the rescue of hypercontraction mutants. These data are consistent with a model in which PINCH is present in limiting quantities within IACs, with increasing PINCH expression reinforcing existing adhesions or allowing for the de novo assembly of new adhesion complexes. Moreover, in myopathies that exhibit hypercontraction, strategic PINCH expression may have therapeutic potential in preserving muscle structure and function.",2013,"Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas, Stephen M Pronovost, Mary C Beckerle, Julie L Kadrmas"

Neuromodulation is an important regulatory feature of many behavioral circuits and the reconfiguring of these circuits by modulators can have both long-term and short-term consequences.

Functional senescence in longevity selected lines has also been shown to occur at a slower rate. However, it is known that performance in a controlled laboratory setting is not necessarily representative of performance in nature. In this study the effect of ageing, environmental temperature and longevity selection on performance in the field was tested. Flies from longevity selected and control lines of different ages (2, 5, 10 and 15 days) were released in an environment free of natural food sources. Control flies were tested at low, intermediate and high temperatures, while longevity selected flies were tested at the intermediate temperature only. The ability of flies to locate and reach a food source was tested. Flies of intermediate age were generally better at locating resources than both younger and older flies, where hot and cold environments accelerate the senescent decline in performance.

Design of RNA splicing analysis null models for post hoc filtering of Drosophila head RNA-Seq data with the splicing analysis kit (Spanki),24209455,10.1186/1471-2105-14-320,"Background:
      
    

    
      The production of multiple transcript isoforms from one gene is a major source of transcriptome complexity. RNA-Seq experiments, in which transcripts are converted to cDNA and sequenced, allow the resolution and quantification of alternative transcript isoforms. However, methods to analyze splicing are underdeveloped and errors resulting in incorrect splicing calls occur in every experiment.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used RNA-Seq data to develop sequencing and aligner error models. By applying these error models to known input from simulations, we found that errors result from false alignment to minor splice motifs and antisense stands, shifted junction positions, paralog joining, and repeat induced gaps. By using a series of quantitative and qualitative filters, we eliminated diagnosed errors in the simulation, and applied this to RNA-Seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. We used high-confidence junction detections to specifically interrogate local splicing differences between transcripts. This method out-performed commonly used RNA-seq methods to identify known alternative splicing events in the Drosophila sex determination pathway.

Sexual activity increases resistance against Pseudomonas entomophila in male Drosophila melanogaster,24010544,10.1186/1471-2148-13-185,"Background:
      
    

    
      Maintenance and deployment cost of immunity is high, therefore, it is expected to trade-off with other high cost traits like sexual activity. Previous studies with Drosophila melanogaster show that male's ability to clear bacteria decreases with increase in sexual activity. We subjected this idea to test using two pathogens (Pseudomonas entomophila and Staphylococcus succinus) and three different populations of Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:

Interestingly, the beneficial effects of sexual activity increased with time of co-habitation with females and declined when access to females was restricted. We observed no change in male survivorship upon experimentally varying the number of sexual interactions.

We have developed a novel liquid membrane NH4(+)-selective microelectrode based on a 19-membered crown compound (TD19C6), which has been used previously in ammonium-selective macroelectrodes. In conjunction with an improved technique for correcting for interference of potassium, NH4(+)-selective microelectrodes based on TD19C6 permit accurate measurement of ammonium concentration in haemolymph samples and nanolitre droplets of fluid secreted by the Malpighian tubules of D. melanogaster.

Drosophila embryonic cell-cycle mutants,23979936,10.1534/g3.113.007880,"Nearly all cell division mutants in Drosophila were recovered in late larval/pupal lethal screens, with less than 10 embryonic lethal mutants identified, because larval development occurs without a requirement for cell division. Only cells in the nervous system and the imaginal cells that generate the adult body divide during larval stages, with larval tissues growing by increasing ploidy rather than cell number. Thus, most mutants perturbing mitosis or the cell cycle do not manifest a phenotype until the adult body differentiates in late larval and pupal stages. To identify cell-cycle components whose maternal pools are depleted in embryogenesis or that have specific functions in embryogenesis, we screened for mutants defective in cell division during embryogenesis. Five new alleles of Cyclin E were recovered, ranging from a missense mutation that is viable to stop codons causing embryonic lethality. These permitted us to investigate the requirements for Cyclin E function in neuroblast cell fate determination, a role previously shown for a null Cyclin E allele. The mutations causing truncation of the protein affect cell fate of the NB6-4 neuroblast, whereas the weak missense mutation has no effect. We identified mutations in the pavarotti (pav) and tumbleweed (tum) genes needed for cytokinesis by a phenotype of large and multinucleate cells in the embryonic epidermis and nervous system.

Olfactory coding in a simple system: adaptation in Drosophila larvae,11416918,10.1098/rspb.2000.1258,"Drosophila melanogaster larvae were pre-stimulated with high concentrations of six homologous alcohols (C4-C9) and then tested for adaptation and cross-adaptation using these same alcohols, four aliphatic n-acetates and three acids.

This substance appears to play a fundamental role in the organization of the larval olfactory system. Test responses to butanol and pentanol, and the effect of pre-stimulation with butanol and pentanol, were not significantly different, indicating that they are sensory equivalents. Heptanol, octanol and nonanol induce a complex set of responses among one another. Cross-adaptation between functional groups was observed, in particular following pre-stimulation with hexanol, but there was also evidence that functional groups are coded separately.

We found evidence for a complex genetic architecture underlying the reaction norms and differences between males and females. Reaction norms were negative quadratics. Genetic correlations were moderately high between traits within environments. Among characteristic values, the magnitudes of genetic correlations varied among traits and sexes. We hypothesized that genetic correlations among environments would decrease as temperatures became more different. This expectation was upheld for only one trait, female thorax length. For males for both traits, the correlations were large for both very similar and very different temperatures. These correlations may constrain the evolution of the shape of the reaction norms. Whether the extent of independence implies specific regulatory genes or only a specific allelic regulation of trait genes can not be decided from our results.",2000,"D Karan, J P Morin, P Gibert, B Moreteau, S M Scheiner, J R David, D Karan, J P Morin, P Gibert, B Moreteau, S M Scheiner, J R David"
Testing the heterogeneity theory of late-life mortality plateaus by using cohorts of Drosophila melanogaster,10705041,10.1016/s0531-5565(99)00082-0,"Variation among individuals in robustness has been posed as a general explanation for the lack of increase in late-life mortality rates. Here, we test corollaries of this heterogeneity theory. One is that populations that have undergone strong laboratory selection for differentiated stress resistance should show significant differences in their late-life mortality schedules. To test this corollary, we employed 40 410 flies from three groups of Drosophila melanogaster populations that differ substantially in their resistance to starvation. No significant differences between these groups were found for late-life mortality. Another corollary of the heterogeneity theory is that there should be late-life plateaus in stress resistance that coincide with the plateau stage of the mortality curve. In 20 994 flies from six replicate outbred laboratory populations, we measured mortality rates every other day and starvation and desiccation resistance every 7 days. Both male and female starvation and desiccation resistance clearly decreased with time overall. There was no late-life plateau in male desiccation resistance. A late-life plateau in male starvation resistance may exist, however. Together, these two experiments generally constitute evidence against heterogeneity as a major contributor to the phenomenon of late-life mortality plateaus.",2000,"M D Drapeau, E K Gass, M D Simison, L D Mueller, M R Rose, M D Drapeau, E K Gass, M D Simison, L D Mueller, M R Rose"
Evidence of age-related changes in the antennal glomeruli of Drosophila melanogaster using monoclonal antibodies,18088918,10.1016/s1467-8039(00)00017-7,"As a tool to better understand the organization of the olfactory pathway three monoclonal antibodies have been isolated and characterized each having a unique staining pattern in the antenna and antennal lobe of Drosophila melanogaster. Monoclonal antibody F14-2D6 stains sensilla coeloconica and thick sensilla basiconica in the funiculus, Y1-3D10 stains only a few sensilla especially in and around the sacculus, while F15-12E8 stains all the sensilla. All three antibodies stain a subset of the glomeruli in the antennal lobe, of which 11 glomeruli are stained in common by all three antibodies. These antibodies could be used to study projection patterns of the sensilla into the antennal lobe. Glomerular staining was observed at different developmental times with the different antibodies. F15-12E8 stains all the glomeruli at eclosion, Y1-3D10 stains only a few glomeruli at eclosion but most glomeruli are stained by the first day after eclosion. F14-2D6 stains all glomeruli only after eclosion. F15-12E8 also stains the mushroom bodies. The antigen recognized by F14-2D6 in the glomeruli shows an increase with age of the flies, measured as increased intensity of staining. These observations suggest that age-related changes continue in the antennal lobe of the flies even after eclosion. These antibodies could therefore serve as unique markers for other studies on the development of the olfactory system.",2000,"Y Mistry, R Mistri, O Siddiqi, Y Mistry, R Mistri, O Siddiqi"

ORs form the largest and most diverse family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are encoded by a multigene family that has been partially characterized in cyclostomes, teleosts, amphibia, birds and mammals, as well as in Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. As new sequence data emerge, it is increasingly clear that OR primary structure can vary dramatically across phyla. Some chemoreceptors are encoded by genes with little sequence similarity to the prototypical ORs originally isolated in mammals. A large number of sequences are now available allowing a detailed study of the evolutionary implications of OR diversity across species.

Role of Enhancer of zeste on the production of Drosophila melanogaster pheromonal hydrocarbons,10663138,10.1007/s001140050013,"In a search for genes controlling the production of Drosophila melanogaster contact pheromones, the gene Enhancer of zeste [E(z)] was found to be one player. Flies mutant for either the amorphic or the antimorphic allele of E(z) showed a similar hydrocarbon phenotype as those with the overlapping Df lxd(15) deficiency: decreased amounts of total hydrocarbons and especially unsaturated ones in both sexes. The decrease in the level of D. melanogaster female sex pheromone 7,11-heptacosadiene was dramatic and was correlated with an increase in 7-heptacosene. Females mutant for a gain-of-function allele had increased amounts of total hydrocarbons with wild-type proportions of dienes. Thus the E(z) gene seems to affect hydrocarbon biosynthesis, especially its desaturation steps and even more so the female-specific desaturation step transforming 7-monoenic fatty acids to 7,11-dienic ones and leading to female pheromones.",2000,"C Wicker-Thomas, J Jallon, C Wicker-Thomas, J Jallon"
The necrotic gene in Drosophila corresponds to one of a cluster of three serpin transcripts mapping at 43A1.2,11063688,,"Mutants of the necrotic (nec) gene in Drosophila melanogaster die in the late pupal stage as pharate adults, or hatch as weak, but relatively normal-looking, flies. Adults develop black melanized spots on the body and leg joints, the abdomen swells with hemolymph, and flies die within 3 or 4 days of eclosion. The TOLL-mediated immune response to fungal infections is constitutively activated in nec mutants and pleiotropic phenotypes include melanization and cellular necrosis. These changes are consistent with activation of one or more proteolytic cascades. The nec gene corresponds to Spn43Ac, one of a cluster of three putative serine proteinase inhibitors at 43A1.2, on the right arm of chromosome 2. Although serpins have been implicated in the activation of many diverse pathways, lack of an individual serpin rarely causes a detectable phenotype. Absence of Spn43Ac, however, gives a clear phenotype, which will allow a mutational analysis of critical features of the molecular structure of serpins.",2000,"C Green, E Levashina, C McKimmie, T Dafforn, J M Reichhart, D Gubb, C Green, E Levashina, C McKimmie, T Dafforn, J M Reichhart, D Gubb"

The influence of amino acids encoded by alternatively spliced exons upon nicotinic radioligand binding and subunit-subunit co-assembly has been examined by heterologous expression in Drosophila S2 cells. The efficiency of subunit assembly has been shown to be influenced by amino acids surrounding the highly conserved 15 amino acid cysteine-loop motif within the N-terminal extracellular domain of the nAChR Dalpha4 subunit. Extensive use has been made of publicly available data determined by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). This includes expressed sequence tag (EST) data as well as whole-embryo in situ hybridisation and polytene chromosome in situ hybridisation data. BDGP in situ hybridisation data suggests that the Dalpha4 mRNA is expressed within Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord and demonstrates that the gene encoding this nAChR subunit is located at position 80B on chromosome 3.

Mutations in D-Titin cause chromosome undercondensation, chromosome breakage, loss of diploidy, and premature sister chromatid separation. Additionally, D-Titin mutants have defects in myoblast fusion and muscle organization.

"Long microsatellite alleles in Drosophila melanogaster have a downward mutation bias and short persistence times, which cause their genome-wide underrepresentation",10880482,,"Microsatellites are short tandemly repeated DNA sequence motifs that are highly variable in most organisms. In contrast to mammals, long microsatellites (>15 repeats) are extremely rare in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. To investigate this paucity of long microsatellites in Drosophila, we studied 19 loci with exceptionally long microsatellite alleles. Inter- and intraspecific analysis showed that long microsatellite alleles arose in D. melanogaster only very recently. This lack of old alleles with many repeats indicated that long microsatellite alleles have short persistence times. The size distribution of microsatellite mutations in mutation-accumulation lines suggests that long alleles have a mutation bias toward a reduction in the number of repeat units. This bias causes the short persistence times of long microsatellite alleles. We propose that species-specific, size-dependent mutation spectra of microsatellite alleles may provide a general mechanism to account for the observed differences in microsatellite length between species.",2000,"B Harr, C SchlÃ¶tterer, B Harr, C SchlÃ¶tterer"

The expression of such 'resident' genes within a heterochromatic environment is paradoxical and poorly understood, given that the same environment can inactivate euchromatic sequences (position effect variegation, or PEV). A second approach involves the study of the local chromosomal environment of heterochromatic (het) genes, as assayed both biochemically, and via the effects of genetic modifiers of PEV, the latter being putative components important for het gene expression.

Molecular population genetics of male accessory gland proteins in Drosophila,11102381,,"Drosophila seminal proteins have an unusually high rate of molecular sequence evolution, suggesting either a high rate of neutral substitution or rapid adaptive evolution.

The elevated divergence of Acp genes is thus accompanied by elevated within-species polymorphism.

A test of translational selection at 'silent' sites in the human genome: base composition comparisons in alternatively spliced genes,11164041,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00482-0,"Natural selection appears to discriminate among synonymous codons to enhance translational efficiency in a wide range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Codon bias is strongly related to gene expression levels in these species. In addition, between-gene variation in silent DNA divergence is inversely correlated with codon bias. However, in mammals, between-gene comparisons are complicated by distinctive nucleotide-content bias (isochores) throughout the genome. In this study, we attempted to identify translational selection by analyzing the DNA sequences of alternatively spliced genes in humans and in Drosophila melanogaster. Among codons in an alternatively spliced gene, those in constitutively expressed exons are translated more often than those in alternatively spliced exons. Thus, translational selection should act more strongly to bias codon usage and reduce silent divergence in constitutive than in alternative exons. By controlling for regional forces affecting base-composition evolution, this within-gene comparison makes it possible to detect codon selection at synonymous sites in mammals. We found that GC-ending codons are more abundant in constitutive than alternatively spliced exons in both Drosophila and humans. Contrary to our expectation, however, silent DNA divergence between mammalian species is higher in constitutive than in alternative exons.",2000,"K Iida, H Akashi, K Iida, H Akashi"
Racing against host's immunity defenses: a likely strategy for passive evasion of encapsulation in Asobara tabida parasitoids,10818243,10.1016/s0022-1910(99)00227-9,"The hymenopteran Asobara tabida Nees (Braconidae, Alysiinae) develops as a solitary endophagous parasite in larvae of several Drosophila species. Most A. tabida eggs possess a sticky chorion which attaches to the tissue of the host organs within a few hours following oviposition. A. tabida sticky eggs usually avoid encapsulation, though the probability of survival decreases in hosts carrying a larger number of circulating hemocytes. Here, we hypothesized that the elicitation of the encapsulation reaction may result from a race between two phenomena: the host's hemocytic reaction and the embedment of the parasitic egg within the host tissues. In order to test this hypothesis, we measured the speed of capsule formation in D. melanogaster larvae of different ages, knowing that the number of circulating hemocytes increases with the age of the larvae. Using a non-virulent A. tabida strain, the eggs of which do not attach to the host tissue, we found that the speed of capsule formation increased correlatively with the age of the D. melanogaster larva. Therefore, the hypothesis of a physiological race between host's immunity defenses and parasite's avoidance of host's defenses is strongly supported by our results. Also, A. tabida eggs which attach to the host's tissue before the attack by the hemocytes has taken place may be considered as a strategy of passive evasion from encapsulation.",2000,"P Eslin, G PrÃ©vost, P Eslin, G PrÃ©vost"

When immigrants were outbred, the mean frequency of the immigrant allele was significantly higher than its initial frequency, in both the first and second generations after immigration. There was no significant change in allele frequency for populations receiving inbred immigrants. The increase in allele frequency for outbred immigrants was attributed to an initial outbred vigour fitness advantage of immigrant males over resident males experiencing inbreeding depression. Hybrid vigour of immigrant progeny and the rare-male effect did not have a statistically significant role in the fitness advantage of the immigrant allele.

An extracellular activator of the Drosophila JAK/STAT pathway is a sex-determination signal element,10879541,10.1038/35016119,"Metazoans use diverse and rapidly evolving mechanisms to determine sex. In Drosophila melanogaster an X-chromosome-counting mechanism determines the sex of an individual by regulating the master switch gene, Sex-lethal (Sxl). The X-chromosome dose is communicated to Sxl by a set of X-linked signal elements (XSEs), which activate transcription of Sxl through its 'establishment' promoter, SxlPe. Here we describe a new XSE called sisterlessC (sisC) whose mode of action differs from that of previously characterized XSEs, all of which encode transcription factors that activate SxlPe directly. In contrast, sisC encodes a secreted ligand for the Drosophila Janus kinase (JAK) and 'signal transducer and activator of transcription' (STAT) signal transduction pathway and is allelic to outstretched (os, also called unpaired). We conclude that sisC works indirectly on Sxl through this signalling pathway because mutations in sisC or in the genes encoding Drosophila JAK or STAT reduce expression of SxlPe similarly. The involvement of os in sex determination confirms that secreted ligands can function in cell-autonomous processes. Unlike sex signals for other organisms, sisC has acquired its sex-specific function while maintaining non-sex-specific roles in development, a characteristic that it shares with all other Drosophila XSEs.",2000,"L Sefton, J R Timmer, Y Zhang, F BÃ©ranger, T W Cline, L Sefton, J R Timmer, Y Zhang, F BÃ©ranger, T W Cline"

However, when asymmetry scores were pooled over the five bristle characters which individually exhibited fluctuating asymmetry, no significant differences were found between any genotypes.

Age-specific decrease in aerobic efficiency associated with increase in oxygen free radical production in Drosophila melanogaster,10891576,10.1016/s0022-1910(00)00072-x,"This study was designed to test the free radical theory of aging by using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Oxygen free radicals are generated by mitochondria during the process of normal oxidative metabolism. Age-specific measurements of oxygen consumption, heat production and anti-oxidant enzyme activity were obtained from two inbred lines of male flies, one selected for longevity and one normal-lived. The findings of this study demonstrate that although oxygen consumption remains relatively constant over the majority of the life span of each line of flies, aerobic efficiency declines with advancing age. This loss of aerobic efficiency manifests itself as a decline in total body metabolism as measured by heat production, and appears to be associated with an age-specific increase in damage inflicted upon mitochondria by oxygen free radicals.",2000,"RE Ross, RE Ross"

Pre-mRNA splicing by the essential Drosophila protein B52: tissue and target specificity,10594020,10.1128/mcb.20.1.181-186.2000,"B52, an essential SR protein of Drosophila melanogaster, stimulates pre-mRNA splicing in splicing-deficient mammalian S100 extracts. Surprisingly, mutant larvae depleted of B52 were found to be capable of splicing at least several pre-mRNAs tested (H. Z. Ring and J. T. Lis, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:7499-7506, 1994). In a homologous in vitro system, we demonstrated that B52 complements a Drosophila S100 extract to allow splicing of a Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) mini-pre-mRNA. Moreover, Kc cell nuclear extracts that were immunodepleted of B52 lost their ability to splice this ftz pre-mRNA. In contrast, splicing of this same ftz pre-mRNA occurred in whole larvae homozygous for the B52 deletion. Other SR protein family members isolated from these larvae could substitute for B52 splicing activity in vitro. We also observed that SR proteins are expressed variably in different larval tissues. B52 is the predominant SR protein in specific tissues, including the brain. Tissues in which B52 is normally the major SR protein, such as larval brain tissue, failed to produce ftz mRNA in the B52 deletion line. These observations support a model in which the lethality of the B52 deletion strain is a consequence of splicing defects in tissues in which B52 is normally the major SR protein.",2000,"B E Hoffman, J T Lis, B E Hoffman, J T Lis"
Identification and characterization of a SUMO-1 conjugation system that modifies neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in Drosophila melanogaster,10995744,10.1074/jbc.M003949200,"Drosophila Uba2 and Ubc9 SUMO-1 conjugation enzyme homologs (DmUba2 and DmUbc9) were isolated as calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening of an adult head cDNA library. We found that at least one isoform of Drosophila neuronal CaMKII is conjugated to DmSUMO-1 in vivo. The interactions observed in the two-hybrid screen may therefore reflect catalytic events. To understand the role of SUMO conjugation in the brain, we undertook a characterization of the system. The other required components of the system, Drosophila Aos1 and SUMO-1 (DmAos1 and DmSUMO-1), were identified in expressed sequence tag data base searches. Purified recombinant DmUba2/DmAos1 dimer can activate DmSUMO-1 in vitro and transfer DmSUMO-1 to recombinant DmUbc9. DmSUMO-1 conjugation occurs in all developmental stages of Drosophila and in the adult central nervous system. Overexpression of a putative dominant negative DmUba2(C175S) mutant protein in the Drosophila central nervous system resulted in an increase in overall DmSUMO-1 conjugates and a base-sensitive p120 species, which is likely to be DmUba2(C175S) linked to endogenous DmSUMO-1 through an oxygen ester bond. Overexpression of DmUba2(wt) protein in vivo also led to increased levels of DmSUMO-1 conjugates. High level overexpression of either DmUba2(wt) or DmUba2(C175S) in the Drosophila central nervous system caused pupal and earlier stage lethality. Expression in the developing eye led to a rough eye phenotype with retinal degeneration. These results suggest that normal SUMO conjugation is essential in the differentiated nervous system and reveal a potential novel mechanism that regulates neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II function.",2000,"X Long, L C Griffith, X Long, L C Griffith"
Genetic control of acute ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila,10968649,,"Background:
      
    

    
      In most organisms in which acute ethanol exposure has been studied, it leads to similar changes in behavior. Generally, low ethanol doses activate the central nervous system, whereas high doses are sedative. Sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is in part under genetic control in rodents and humans, and reduced sensitivity in humans predicts the development of alcoholism (Crabbe et al., 1994; Schuckit, 1994). We have established Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study the mechanisms that regulate acute sensitivity to ethanol.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured the effects of ethanol vapor on Drosophila locomotor behaviors by using three different assays. Horizontal locomotion was quantified in a locomotor chamber, turning behavior was assayed in narrow tubes, and ethanol-induced loss of postural control was measured in an inebriometer. Mutants with altered sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol were generated by treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate and isolated by selection in the inebriometer. We ascertained the effects of these mutations on ethanol pharmacokinetics by measuring ethanol levels in extracts of flies at various times during and after ethanol exposure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Among nearly 30,000 potentially mutant flies tested, we isolated 19 mutant strains with reduced and 4 strains with increased sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol as measured in the inebriometer. Of these mutants, four showed changes in ethanol absorption. Two mutants, named barfly and tipsy to reflect their reduced and increased ethanol sensitivity in the inebriometer, respectively, were analyzed for locomotor behaviors. Both mutants exhibited ethanol-induced hyperactivity that was indistinguishable from wild type. However, barfly and tipsy displayed reduced and increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol, respectively. Finally, both mutants showed an increased rate of ethanol-induced turning behavior.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The effects of acute ethanol exposure on Drosophila locomotor behaviors are remarkably similar to those described for mammals. The analysis of mutants with altered sensitivity to ethanol revealed that the genetic pathways which regulate these responses are complex and that single genes can affect hyperactivity, turning, and sedation independently.",2000,"C M Singh, U Heberlein, C M Singh, U Heberlein"
Integration of Bombyx mori R2 sequences into the 28S ribosomal RNA genes of Drosophila melanogaster,10594024,10.1128/mcb.20.1.213-223.2000,"R2 non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposable elements integrate into a precise location in the 28S rRNA genes of arthropods. The purified protein encoded by R2 can cleave the 28S gene target site and use the 3' hydroxyl group generated by this cleavage to prime reverse transcription of its own RNA, a process called target-primed reverse transcription. An integration system is described here in which components from the R2 element of the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, are injected into the preblastoderm embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. Silkmoth R2 sequences were readily detected in the 28S rRNA genes of the surviving adults as well as in the genes of their progeny. The 3' junctions of these insertions were similar to those seen in our in vitro assays, as well as those from endogenous R2 retrotransposition events. The 5' junctions of the insertions originally contained major deletions of both R2 and 28S gene sequences, a problem overcome by the inclusion of upstream 28S gene sequences at the 5' end of the injected RNA. The resulting 5' junctions suggested a recombination event between the cDNA and the upstream target sequences. This in vivo integration system should help determine the mechanism of R2 retrotransposition and be useful as a delivery system to integrate defined DNA sequences into the rRNA genes of organisms.",2000,"D G Eickbush, D D Luan, T H Eickbush, D G Eickbush, D D Luan, T H Eickbush"

The mechanism of resistance appears to be altered JH reception. We measured fertility, JH-hydrolyzing activity, and dopamine (DA) levels in Met(27) and Met(+) flies under normal (25 degrees C) and heat-stress (38 degrees C) conditions. We show that under normal conditions Met(27) females have JH-hydrolyzing activity and fertility lower than Met(+), but DA content did not differ between the two strains. At 38 degrees C Met(27) flies show no impairment in JH-hydrolyzing activity in response to stress, but they do show lower DA levels and impaired reproduction. The results with Met(27) are consistent with the previous hypothesis that the alteration in fertility that follows heat stress in D. melanogaster could result from alteration in the JH endocrine system.",2000,"N E.

Isolation and characterisation of murine homologues of the Drosophila seven in absentia gene (sina),8404535,,"The seven in absentia gene (sina) is required for formation of the R7 photoreceptor cell in the developing eye of Drosophila melanogaster. The sina protein contains a putative zinc finger domain and localises to the cell nucleus in Drosophila. We report here the identification of a family of genes in the mouse (designated Siah) with extensive sequence homology to Drosophila sina. The Siah genes fall into two main groups: Siah-1, which consists of four closely related members, two of which appear to be functional, and Siah-2, which contains a single functional member. The predicted Siah proteins show an unusually high degree of conservation with sina over the majority of their lengths, diverging significantly only at their amino terminal ends. The Siah-1 and Siah-2 genes are widely expressed at a low level in the embryo and adult. Analysis of Siah-2 by hybridisation histochemistry shows that it is expressed at a higher level in a restricted number of sites during development, including the olfactory epithelium, retina, forebrain and proliferating cartilage of developing bone. The striking degree of sequence homology observed between the Drosophila and murine genes implies strong conservation pressure on the Siah genes and suggests that they play a significant role in vertebrate development.",1993,"N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell, N G Della, P V Senior, D D Bowtell"
Evolutionary genetics of Drosophila esterases,8119594,10.1007/BF01435043,"Over 30 carboxylester hydrolases have been identified in D. melanogaster. Most are classified as acetyl, carboxyl or cholinesterases. Sequence similarities among most of the carboxyl and all the cholinesterases so far characterised from D. melanogaster and other eukaryotes justify recognition of a carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family. This family shows minimal sequence similarities with other esterases but crystallographic data for a few non-drosophilid enzymes show that the family shares a distinctive overall structure with some other carboxyl and aryl esterases, so they are all put in one superfamily of/beta hydrolases. Fifteen esterase genes have been mapped in D. melanogaster and twelve are clustered at two chromosomal sites. The constitution of each cluster varies across Drosophila species but two carboxyl esterases in one cluster are sufficiently conserved that their homologues can be identified among enzymes conferring insecticide resistance in other Diptera. Sequence differences between two other esterases, the EST6 carboxyl esterase and acetylcholinesterase, have been interpreted against the consensus super-secondary structure for the carboxyl/cholinesterase multigene family; their sequence differences are widely dispersed across the structure and include substantial divergence in substrate binding sites and the active site gorge. This also applies when EST6 is compared across species where differences in its expression indicate a difference in function. However, comparisons within and among species where EST6 expression is conserved show that many aspects of the predicted super-secondary structure are tightly conserved. Two notable exceptions are a pair of polymorphisms in the substrate binding site of the enzyme in D. melanogaster. These polymorphisms are associated with differences in substrate interactions in vitro and demographic data indicate that the alternative forms are not selectively equivalent in vivo.",1993,"J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell, J G Oakeshott, E A van Papenrecht, T M Boyce, M J Healy, R J Russell"
"[Role of the homologous translocation, located on the Y-chromosome, in mutagenesis of the double super-unstable system in Drosophila melanogaster males]",8370516,,"Main features of mutagenesis induced in the double super-unstable system in Drosophila melanogaster males and females was studied earlier. Very different y- and sc-alleles arose under the mutagenesis. These are differed one from another by the expression of yellow and scute loci. However, it was shown that the female's mutagenesis very differed from the male's one. The structure of a homologous chromosome has played an important role in the mutagenesis in Drosophila females. We found here that the homologous translocation in Y chromosome led to double decrease of the frequency of the mutagenesis in males. It is proposed that interconnections between two homologous insertions are essential in the recombinational processes by which alleles change. The nature and mechanism of the sub-lethal allele's formation in the presence of translocation in Y chromosome is discussed.",1993,"O V Okladnova, O V Okladnova"
Expression of an amylase--alcohol dehydrogenase chimeric gene in transgenic strains of Drosophila melanogaster,7505762,10.1139/g93-125,"A chimeric gene, consisting of 428 bp of the promoter sequences of the alpha-amylase gene of Drosophila melanogaster, fused to the transcribed region of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene, was introduced into the genome of an Adhnull stock of Drosophila via P element mediated transformation. DNA analysis (Southern blotting) of three transformant strains confirmed the insertion of either one or two copies of the chimeric gene per strain. A histochemical study of ADH enzyme activity in dissected tissues of the transgenic larvae revealed that the chimeric Amy-Adh gene was expressed only in the posterior larval midgut and that this expression was repressed by dietary glucose, thus representing an expression pattern characteristic of the Amy gene. This indicates that the Amy upstream promoter sequences contain signals mediating both tissue specificity and glucose repression of the Adh structural gene in the transgenic larvae. The level of ADH activity expressed in transgenic flies was relatively low. This was paralleled by a low level of Adh mRNA, indicating a reduction in the transcriptional rate of the chimeric gene.",1993,"A A Grunder, A Loverre-Chyurlia, D A Hickey, A A Grunder, A Loverre-Chyurlia, D A Hickey"

Highly degenerate oligonucleotides encoding two conserved regions were used in a PCR reaction to amplify cDNAs encoding each of the known ARF proteins and eight additional cDNA fragments encoding previously unreported human members of the ARF family. Additional sequences were obtained from yeast or fly libraries by using this technique. These oligonucleotides specifically amplify members of the ARF family but not the structurally related G protein alpha subunits or members of the other three subfamilies of the RAS superfamily. Fragments obtained by PCR were used to obtain full-length sequences encoding highly homologous ARF-like (ARL) gene products from human and Drosophila melanogaster libraries, termed ARL2 and Ar184F, respectively. The encoded proteins are each 184 amino acids long and are 76% identical, with 40-45% identity to human ARF1 and Drosophila arf-like (arl) proteins. These genes appear to be generally expressed in human tissues and during Drosophila development. The purified human ARL2 protein differed in several biochemical properties from human ARF proteins, including the complete absence of ARF activity. Thus, the ARF family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins includes at least 15 distinct but structurally conserved members, including both the functionally conserved ARF proteins and the functionally disparate ARL proteins. The latter proteins currently comprise two distinct gene products in Drosophila (arl and ARL84F) and one in man (ARL2).",1993,"J Clark, L Moore, A Krasinskas, J Way, J Battey, J Tamkun, R A Kahn, J Clark, L Moore, A Krasinskas, J Way, J Battey, J Tamkun, R A Kahn"

Conservation of regulatory elements controlling hairy pair-rule stripe formation,8330529,,"The hairy (h) gene is one of two pair-rule loci whose striped expression is directly regulated by combinations of gap proteins acting through discrete upstream regulatory fragments, which span several kilobases. We have undertaken a comparative study of the molecular biology of h pair-rule expression in order to identify conserved elements in this complex regulatory system, which should provide important clues concerning the mechanism of stripe formation. A molecular comparison of the h locus in Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster reveals a conserved overall arrangement of the upstream regulatory elements that control individual pair-rule stripes. We demonstrate that upstream fragments from D. virilis will direct the proper expression of stripes in D. melanogaster, indicating that these are true functional homologs of the stripe-producing D. melanogaster regulatory elements, and that the network of trans-acting proteins that act upon these regulatory elements is highly conserved. We also demonstrate that the spatial relationships between specific h stripes and selected gap proteins are highly conserved. We find several tracts of extensive nucleotide sequence conservation within homologous stripe-specific regulatory fragments, which have facilitated the identification of functional subelements within the D. melanogaster regulatory fragment for h stripe 5. Some of the conserved nucleotide tracts within this regulatory fragment contain consensus binding sites for potential trans-regulatory (gap and other) proteins, while many appear devoid of known binding sites. This comparative approach, coupled with the analysis of reporter gene expression in gap mutant embryos suggests that the Kr and gt proteins establish the anterior and posterior borders of h stripe 5, respectively, through spatial repression.

The function of the nucleocapsid promoter elements was examined by transient transfection assays in D. melanogaster Schneider line-2 cells by using these binding sites cloned into a minimal promoter element. Each of these regulatory regions transactivated transcription from the minimal promoter element in response to exogenously expressed Sp1.

"A new method for manipulating transgenes: engineering heat tolerance in a complex, multicellular organism",15335817,10.1016/0960-9822(93)90218-d,"Background:
      
    

    
      Heat-shock proteins (hsps) are thought to protect cells against stresses, especially due to elevated temperatures. But while genetic manipulation of hsp gene expression can protect microorganisms and cultured metazoan cells against lethal stress, this has so far not been demonstrated in multicellular organisms. Testing whether expression of an hsp transgene contributes to increased stress tolerance is complicated by a general problem of transgene analysis: if the transgene cannot be targeted to a precise site in the genome, newly observed phenotypes may be due to either the action of the transgene or mutations caused by the transgene insertion.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To study the relationship between heat tolerance and hsp expression in Drosophila melanogaster, we have developed a novel method for transgene analysis, based upon the site-specific FLP recombinase. The method employs site-specific sister chromatid exchange to create an allelic series of transgene insertions that share the same integration site, but differ in transgene copy number. Phenotypic differences between members of this series can be confidently attributed to the transgenes. Using such an allelic series and a novel thermotolerance assay for Drosophila embryos, we investigated the role of the 70 kD heat-shock protein, Hsp 70, in thermotolerance. At early embryonic stages, Hsp70 accumulation was rate-limiting for thermotolerance, and elevated Hsp70 expression increased survival at extreme temperatures.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results provide an improved method for analyzing transgenes and demonstrate that, in Drosophila, Hsp70 is a critical thermotolerance factor. They show, moreover, that manipulating the expression of a single hsp can be sufficient to improve the stress tolerance of a complex multicellular organism.",1993,"M A Welte, J M Tetrault, R P Dellavalle, S L Lindquist, M A Welte, J M Tetrault, R P Dellavalle, S L Lindquist"

The Polycomb gene is differentially regulated during oogenesis and embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster,8095152,10.1016/0925-4773(93)90086-d,"Homeotic genes are responsible for determining the identity of body structures along the anterior-posterior axis. In Drosophila the early patterning system defines the differential expression pattern of the homeotic genes. In laterstages the Polycomb-group (Pc-G) genes were found to keep homeotic genes stably repressed in those domains where they have to be inactive. At the molecular level the Pc-G is supposed to exert its repressory role by influencing the higher order structure of chromatin. Here we show that during oogenesis the Polycomb (Pc) protein is localized in the polytene nuclei of the nurse cells. In addition, in late stages we observe overlapping gradients of expression in the somatic follicle cells, suggesting also an important function of Pc on the determinants involved in egg formation. During embryogenesis Pc is found in all tissues, though in later stages it preferentially accumulates in the CNS. Interestingly, we have identified a feedback-type regulation: the Ultrabithorax gene, a homeotic target gene of Pc, in its own domain of expression is down-regulating Pc.",1993,"R Paro, B Zink, R Paro, B Zink"
The Drosophila melanogaster dodecasatellite sequence is closely linked to the centromere and can form connections between sister chromatids during mitosis,8360277,,"We have used fluorescence in situ hybridisation to wild-type and rearranged mitotic chromosomes to map the Drosophila melanogaster dodecasatellite sequence. It is located at a unique site, within the pericentric heterochromatin of the right arm of the third chromosome, closely linked to the primary constriction. In polytene chromosomes, dodecasatellite is found as one or a few dots in the central region of the chromocentre. In untreated diploid cells, dodecasatellite sequences are found as one or two dots throughout the cell cycle. This distribution can be altered in a cell cycle-dependent manner in two ways. Firstly, in interphase cells, hypotonic shock promotes the decondensation of the genomic region containing this satellite, resulting in a string-like structure. Secondly, some of the precociously separated sister chromatids produced by colchicine treatment show dodecasatellite within the intervening space connecting the main dodecasatellite signals of each chromatid. The distribution of dodecasatellite seems to be rather constant between individuals of the same species, as indicated by the lack of any detectable variations in its pattern amongst individuals from six geographically distant strains of D. melanogaster. On the other hand, the distribution of dodecasatellite shows a remarkable degree of variation amongst closely related species of the melanogaster subgroup ranging from a non-detectable signal in Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila teissieri, to staining in the X, second and third chromososomes of Drosophila mauritiana.",1993,"M Carmena, J P Abad, A Villasante, C Gonzalez, M Carmena, J P Abad, A Villasante, C Gonzalez"

Probing the function of Drosophila melanogaster accessory glands by directed cell ablation,8367469,10.1073/pnas.90.17.8093,"The female Drosophila melanogaster fly undergoes behavioral changes after mating, including an increase in egg laying and an avoidance of remating. Accessory-gland products elicit these changes transiently when introduced into unmated female flies. We report here the generation and phenotype of flies that lack functional accessory-gland main cells as a consequence of genetically directed delivery of diphtheria toxin subunit A to those cells. Only main-cell secretions are essential for the short-term inhibition to remating; no other products of the genital tract can replace their function. Long-term inhibition to remating depends only on the storage of sperm in the female. Both sperm and main-cell secretions have roles in the increase of egg laying by the mated female. In addition to full-strength diphtheria toxin, we used low-activity toxins to kill only those cells that express toxin at high levels. These transgenic strains that express diphtheria toxins of different strengths in accessory-gland main cells will be useful in further defining the role of these cells.",1993,"J M Kalb, A J DiBenedetto, M F Wolfner, J M Kalb, A J DiBenedetto, M F Wolfner"
Doc and copia instability in an isogenic Drosophila melanogaster stock,8394986,10.1007/BF00277071,"A high degree of heterogeneity and an overall increase in number of insertion sites of the mobile elements Doc and copia were revealed in one substock of an isogenic Drosophila melanogaster stock, while in two other substocks the distribution of copia sites was highly homogenous, but that of Doc sites was again heterogeneous. We therefore concluded that copia was unstable in one of the substocks and Doc was unstable in all. Doc instability presumably arose earlier than copia instability. Doc and copia transpositions were directly observed in experiments with one substock. An abundance of copia insertions was revealed in the X chromosome where insertions with deleterious effects are exposed to selection in hemizygous condition. The locations of many other mobile elements (mdg1, mdg2, mdg3, mdg4, 297, B104, H.M.S.

Variation in morphological traits of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) under nutritional stress,10098267,10.1038/sj.hdy.6884660,"The effect of nutritional stress on phenotypical and genetic variation was examined for five morphological traits (thorax length, wing length, sternopleural chaeta number, abdominal chaeta number and arista branch number) in 30 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Phenotypical variation of all traits except sternopleural chaeta number and fluctuating asymmetry of all bilateral traits were significantly higher in flies reared under poor feeding conditions. Estimates of isofemale line heritability (coefficients of intraclass correlation) did not show a consistent pattern among traits. However, additive genetic variance was generally higher in poor feeding conditions in all traits except sternopleural chaeta number, although these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, estimates of evolvability were higher under nutritional stress for all traits except sternopleural chaeta number. These results suggest that nutritional stress increases the expression of genetic variation for some morphological traits in Drosophila and, in this respect, is similar to the effects of temperature stress studied previously.",1999,"A G Imasheva, D V Bosenko, O A Bubli, A G Imasheva, D V Bosenko, O A Bubli"

Diquat was the only chemical for which the results were clearly negative, probably because its high toxicity, whereas indications of a marginal genotoxicity raised for menadione.

However, increased levels of neurally expressed P210 or P185 Bcr-Abl but not Drosophila Abl produced CNS defects and lethality.

Sequencing and functional expression of the malonyl-CoA-sensitive carnitine palmitoyltransferase from Drosophila melanogaster,10417309,,"Using expressed sequence tag data, we obtained a cDNA for a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I)-like molecule from Drosophila melanogaster. The cDNA encodes a 782-residue protein that shows 49% and 48% sequence identity with the rat liver and skeletal-muscle isoforms of CPT I respectively. The sequence has two predicted membrane-spanning regions, suggesting that it adopts the same topology as its mammalian counterparts. The sequence contains all the residues that have been shown to be characteristic of carnitine acetyltransferases. Expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris confirmed that the cDNA does encode a CPT enzyme. The activity was found to be associated with a mitochondria-enriched fraction. Kinetic analysis revealed a K(m) for carnitine of 406 microM and a K(m) for palmitoyl-CoA of 105 microM. The CPT activity was very sensitive to inhibition by malonyl-CoA, with an IC(50) of 0.74 microM when the activity was assayed with 35 microM palmitoyl-CoA and 1% (w/v) albumin at pH 7.0. A histidine residue at position 140 in rat liver CPT I has been indicated to be important for inhibition by malonyl-CoA. The equivalent residue (position 136) in Drosophila CPT I is arginine, implying that any basic residue might be compatible with such sensitivity. Evidence is presented that, unlike in mammals, Drosophila has only a single CPT I gene. Sequences suggesting the existence of a splice variant in the 5' untranslated region were found; this was consistent with the existence of two promoters for the CPT I gene.",1999,"V N Jackson, J M Cameron, V A Zammit, N T Price, V N Jackson, J M Cameron, V A Zammit, N T Price"

The teratogenic effect of these poisons is expressed as a reduction of ommatidia in adult flies when the drug is fed to larvae. The highest frequency of phenocopies was recorded in temperature- and mutagen-sensitive strains. The mutagenic activity of vinblastin and griseofulvin was confirmed by the wing-spot test (somatic mutation and recombination test, SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, this test demonstrated mutagenic activity of colchicine. All of the mitotic poisons induced small single spots but did not increase frequency of twin spots mwh/flr. Spot frequency was significantly higher in mutagen-sensitive mutants having defective excision repair. Heat shock (45-min exposure at 37 degrees C) decreased the frequency of phenocopies induced by the mitotic poisons. When third-instar larvae were subjected to heat shock prior to drug administration, the frequency of mutant cell clones was significantly reduced.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the protein Mvl is expressed in macrophages and in differentiated neurons; loss-of-function mutations lead to defects in gustatory behaviour. The human Nramp-1 protein was expressed in Drosophila melanogaster using the hsp70 promoter. Overexpression in normal animals does not lead to any alterations in their behaviour or physiology. In mutants, however, ubiquitous expression of human Nramp-1 can totally rescue the taste defect.

Selection for reduced thorax length was associated with reduced growth rate, no change in duration of larval development and a reduced critical larval weight for pupariation. In both lines selected for thorax length and lines selected for wing area, total body size changed in the same direction as the artificially selected trait.

Attempts to demonstrate preimaginal conditioning, here taken to mean the retention of learning through metamorphosis, have given mixed results. We used two behavioural assays (the T maze and trap assay) to see whether a change in adult responsiveness could be induced by exposing Drosophila melanogaster larvae to a conditioning stimulus. There was no evidence for preimaginal conditioning from either assay, but the trap assay demonstrated that menthol contamination from the larval environment on the puparial surface could induce a change in adult behaviour. Exposure of adult insects to this contamination could give the appearance of preimaginal conditioning, when in fact the behavioural induction occurred during the adult stage. Young flies responded less strongly than older flies to the odour cues in both assays. This may explain the apparently contradictory findings of some earlier studies of preimaginal conditioning.

To identify other molecules that function with Gcl in this process, we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen that utilized Gcl protein as bait. A predominant class of Gcl-interacting clones encodes a species of importin-alpha from Drosophila (karyopherin-alpha3; kap-alpha3), a nuclear-localization sequence binding protein previously shown to act in the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The expression of kap-alpha3 is widespread both temporally and spatially throughout the embryo during development, as judged by Northern blotting and whole-mount in situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos, suggesting that it functions at multiple stages of development. Studies of the Gcl/Kap-alpha3 interaction have identified a functional nuclear-localization sequence in Gcl protein which is necessary for an in vivo interaction and for nuclear entry of Gcl, making it likely that one role for Kap-alpha3 is to deliver Gcl protein to the nucleus. The identification of Kap-alpha3 and an in vivo substrate will allow for further characterization of the basis for specificity between importin-alpha molecules and their binding substrates.",1999,"T C Dockendorff, Z Tang, T A Jongens, T C Dockendorff, Z Tang, T A Jongens"
The dorsal-open group gene raw is required for restricted DJNK signaling during closure,10518507,,"During dorsal closure in Drosophila melanogaster, cells of the lateral epidermis migrate over the amnioserosa to encase the embryo. At least three classes of dorsal-open group gene products are necessary for this morphogenetic movement. Class I genes code for structural proteins that effect changes in epidermal cell shape and motility. Class II and III genes code for regulatory components of closure: Class II genes encode Drosophila Jun amino (N)-terminal kinase (DJNK) signaling molecules and Class III genes encode Decapentaplegic-mediated signaling molecules. All characterized dorsal-open group gene products function in the epidermis. Here we report a molecular and genetic characterization of raw, a newly defined member of the Class II dorsal-open group genes. We show that the novel protein encoded by raw is required for restriction of DJNK signaling to leading edge epidermal cells as well as for proper development of the amnioserosa. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for Raw in restriction of epidermal signaling during closure and suggest that this effect may be mediated via the amnioserosa.",1999,"C L Byars, K L Bates, A Letsou, C L Byars, K L Bates, A Letsou"
The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project gene disruption project: Single P-element insertions mutating 25% of vital Drosophila genes,10471706,,"A fundamental goal of genetics and functional genomics is to identify and mutate every gene in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. The Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) gene disruption project generates single P-element insertion strains that each mutate unique genomic open reading frames. Such strains strongly facilitate further genetic and molecular studies of the disrupted loci, but it has remained unclear if P elements can be used to mutate all Drosophila genes. We now report that the primary collection has grown to contain 1045 strains that disrupt more than 25% of the estimated 3600 Drosophila genes that are essential for adult viability. Of these P insertions, 67% have been verified by genetic tests to cause the associated recessive mutant phenotypes, and the validity of most of the remaining lines is predicted on statistical grounds. Sequences flanking >920 insertions have been determined to exactly position them in the genome and to identify 376 potentially affected transcripts from collections of EST sequences. Strains in the BDGP collection are available from the Bloomington Stock Center and have already assisted the research community in characterizing >250 Drosophila genes. The likely identity of 131 additional genes in the collection is reported here. Our results show that Drosophila genes have a wide range of sensitivity to inactivation by P elements, and provide a rationale for greatly expanding the BDGP primary collection based entirely on insertion site sequencing. We predict that this approach can bring >85% of all Drosophila open reading frames under experimental control.",1999,"A C Spradling, D Stern, A Beaton, E J Rhem, T Laverty, N Mozden, S Misra, G M Rubin, A C Spradling, D Stern, A Beaton, E J Rhem, T Laverty, N Mozden, S Misra, G M Rubin"
The human homolog of Drosophila cornichon protein is differentially expressed in alloactivated T-cells,10209299,10.1016/s0167-4889(99)00026-9,"To identify novel genes induced in the early stage of T-cell activation, mRNA expression in alloactivated human lymphocytes was examined.

The corresponding complete 1396 bp cDNA, named TGAM77, encodes a predicted 134 amino acid protein which shares 63% homology with the cornichon (cni) protein of Drosophila melanogaster. Upregulation of TGAM77 mRNA in the early phase of T-cell activation was confirmed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of activated human lymphocytes. TGAM77 mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues with various expression levels. In analogy to cni which is involved in an epidermal growth factor-like signaling pathway inducing cellular asymmetry in Drosophila oogenesis, TGAM77 might function in similar signaling establishing vectorial re-localization and concentration of signaling events in T-cell activation.",1999,"N Utku, G C Bulwin, S Beinke, T Heinemann, F Beato, J Randall, B Schnieders, K Sandhoff, H D Volk, E Milford, S R Gullans, N Utku, G C Bulwin, S Beinke, T Heinemann, F Beato, J Randall, B Schnieders, K Sandhoff, H D Volk, E Milford, S R Gullans"
Poisson distribution of male mating success in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster,10425920,10.1017/s0016672399003730,"Variation among males and females in reproductive success is a major determinant of effective population size. Most studies of male mating success in Drosophila, however, have been done under conditions very different from those in typical cultures. We determined the distribution of male mating success in five laboratory populations of D. melanogaster maintained on a 14 d, discrete generation cycle fairly representative of standard Drosophila cultures. Mating success was measured as the number of matings a male could achieve under conditions closely approximating a regular culture vial of these populations. Preliminary studies determined that most mating in these populations occurred within 14 h of the flies attaining sexual maturity. Consequently, individual virgin males were marked with white paint on their thorax, put into vials with varying numbers of unmarked virgin flies of both sexes, and monitored continuously for matings over a period of up to 14 h. At various times during the assay, virgin males and females were added to these vials in proportions simulating the pattern of eclosion in culture vials. The observed variation in the number of matings per male in the five populations was, by and large, consistent with a Poisson distribution, suggesting that male mating success in short-generation-time, discrete-generation laboratory cultures of D. melanogaster may fulfil a fundamental assumption of the Wright-Fisher model of genetic drift in finite populations.",1999,"A Joshi, M H Do, L D Mueller, A Joshi, M H Do, L D Mueller"
Different period gene repeats take 'turns' at fine-tuning the circadian clock,10629978,10.1098/rspb.1999.0920,"The repetitive region of the circadian clock gene period in Drosophila pseudoobscura consists predominantly of a pentapeptide sequence whose consensus is NSGAD. In D. melanogaster, this region is replaced by a dipeptide Thr-Gly repeat, which plays a role in the thermal stability of the circadian phenotype. The Thr-Gly repeat has been shown to form a type II or III beta-turn, whose conformational monomer is (Thr-Gly)3. Here we report, using conformational analyses, that both an NSGAD pentapeptide, and a polymer of the same sequence, form type II beta-turns. Thus two peptide sequences, whose amino-acid composition is very different, nevertheless form the same secondary structure.

Mass determination of the unit cell of the innermost chorionic layer in Drosophilidae by scanning transmission electron microscopy,10544051,10.1006/jsbi.1999.4159,"The innermost chorionic layer (ICL) in eggshells of Drosophila melanogaster is a naturally occurring patchwork of thin three-dimensional crystalline plates located between the inner endochorion and the vitelline envelope. The mass-per-unit area of the ICL has been measured from scanning transmission electron microscope images of isolated unstained material and it was possible to distinguish up to four layers with the majority of the crystalline sheets being one to three layers thick. Taking into account the unit cell areas for the different crystals, we have estimated the mean ICL subunit sizes to be 36 kDa for Drosophila melanogaster, 35 kDa for Drosophila auraria, and 33 kDa for Drosophila teissieri.

"Isolation and characterization of drosocrystallin, a lens crystallin gene of Drosophila melanogaster",10049575,10.1006/dbio.1998.9170,"We have cloned the drosocrystallin gene (dcy) of Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes a major protein of the corneal lens, previously described in part by Komori et al. (1992, J. Cell Sci. 102, 191-201). Synthesis of the DCY protein starts weakly in 2-day-old pupae, reaches a peak at day 3 and day 4 of pupal development, and decreases very fast in young adults. The dcy mRNA is detected in the compound eyes as well as in the ocelli. The presence of a putative signal peptide and the extracellular location of DCY suggest that DCY is a secreted protein. Interestingly, the dcy gene shows sequence similarities to some insect cuticular proteins and is detected as well in two closely related Drosophila species, D. sechellia and D. simulans, and in one more distantly related species, D. virilis. This finding supports the hypothesis that Drosophila used the same strategy as vertebrates and mollusks, namely, recruiting a multifunctional protein for refraction in the lens, by a gene-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, it supports our intercalary evolution hypothesis, which suggests that the development of an elaborate structure (for example, a compound eye) from an original primitive form (an ancestral photoreceptor organ) can be achieved by recruiting novel genes into the original developmental pathway.",1999,"H Janssens, W J Gehring, H Janssens, W J Gehring"

Genetic variation in rates of nondisjunction: association of two naturally occurring polymorphisms in the chromokinesin nod with increased rates of nondisjunction in Drosophila melanogaster,10430586,,"Genetic variation in nondisjunction frequency among X chromosomes from two Drosophila melanogaster natural populations is examined in a sensitized assay. A high level of genetic variation is observed (a range of 0.006-0.241). Two naturally occurring variants at the nod locus, a chromokinesin required for proper achiasmate chromosome segregation, are significantly associated with an increased frequency of nondisjunction. Both of these polymorphisms are found at intermediate frequency in widely distributed natural populations. To account for these observations, we propose a general model incorporating unique opportunities for meiotic drive during female meiosis. The oÃ¶tid competition model can account for both high mean rates of female-specific nondisjunction in Drosophila and humans as well as the standing genetic variation in this critical fitness character in natural populations.",1999,"M E Zwick, J L Salstrom, C H Langley, M E Zwick, J L Salstrom, C H Langley"
Comparative analysis of promoters for transient gene expression in cultured mosquito cells,9927172,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.810031.x,"Three heterologous promoters (hsp70 and actin 5C from Drosophila melanogaster and IE1 from the immediate early gene of the Bombyx mori baculovirus) were assessed for their ability to drive transient luciferase expression in mosquito cells. Overall, the actin 5C promoter was considerably more effective at driving luciferase expression than either hsp70 or IE1 in cell lines derived from Anopheles, Aedes and Culex species. hsp70 functioned well when induced by heat shock and was also induced to a lesser extent by chemicals such as sodium arsenite. IE1 was also an effective initiator of transcription, particularly in two Anopheles cell lines, but generally it performed less well than the actin 5C promoter and was also outperformed by hsp70 in Anopheles gambiae cells.",1999,"Y G Zhao, P Eggleston, Y G Zhao, P Eggleston"

To identify the bioactive ligand, a 'reverse physiology' strategy was used whereby orphan Drosophila receptor-expressing frog oocytes were screened against potential ligands. Agonistic activity was electrophysiologically recorded as inward potassium currents mediated through co-expressed G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK). Using this approach a novel peptide was purified from Drosophila head extracts. Mass spectrometry revealed an octapeptide of 925 Da with a sequence Ser-Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ser-Phe-Gly-Leu-NH(2) reminiscent of insect allatostatin peptides known to control diverse functions such as juvenile hormone synthesis during metamorphosis or visceral muscle contractions.

Suppression of polyglutamine-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila by the molecular chaperone HSP70,10581028,10.1038/70532,"At least eight inherited human neurodegenerative diseases are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine domain within the respective proteins. This confers dominant toxicity on the proteins, leading to dysfunction and loss of neurons. Expanded polyglutamine proteins form aggregates, including nuclear inclusions (NI), within neurons, possibly due to misfolding of the proteins. NI are ubiquitinated and sequester molecular chaperone proteins and proteasome components, suggesting that disease pathogenesis includes activation of cellular stress pathways to help refold, disaggregate or degrade the mutant disease proteins. Overexpression of specific chaperone proteins reduces polyglutamine aggregation in transfected cells, but whether this alters toxicity is unknown. Using a Drosophila melanogaster model of polyglutamine disease, we show that directed expression of the molecular chaperone HSP70 suppresses polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. Suppression by HSP70 occurred without a visible effect on NI formation, indicating that polyglutamine toxicity can be dissociated from formation of large aggregates. Our studies indicate that HSP70 or related molecular chaperones may provide a means of treating these and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal protein conformation and toxicity.",1999,"J M Warrick, H Y Chan, G L Gray-Board, Y Chai, H L Paulson, N M Bonini, J M Warrick, H Y Chan, G L Gray-Board, Y Chai, H L Paulson, N M Bonini"
Alternative splicing of lola generates 19 transcription factors controlling axon guidance in Drosophila,12897787,10.1038/nn1105,"The Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Lola (longitudinals lacking) is a pivotal regulator of neural wiring that sets the precise expression levels of proteins that execute specific axon guidance decisions. Lola has a zinc finger DNA binding domain and a BTB (for Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) dimerization motif. We now show that alternative splicing of the lola gene creates a family of 19 transcription factors. All lola isoforms share a common dimerization domain, but 17 have their own unique DNA-binding domains. Seven of these 17 isoforms are present in the distantly-related Dipteran Anopheles gambiae, suggesting that the properties of specific isoforms are likely to be critical to lola function. Analysis of the expression patterns of individual splice variants and of the phenotypes of mutants lacking single isoforms supports this idea and establishes that the alternative forms of lola are responsible for different functions of this gene. Thus, in this system, the alternative splicing of a key transcription factor helps to explain how a small genome encodes all the information that is necessary to specify the enormous diversity of axonal trajectories.",2003,"Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger, Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger"

The majority of neurons expressing a given receptor converge onto one or two major glomeruli as described previously. However, we detected a few additional glomeruli, which are less intensely innervated and also tend to be somewhat variable. This means that functionally similar olfactory neurons connect to small subsets of glomeruli rather than to a single glomerulus as believed previously.

The comparison of intrinsic rates of increase among chromosome-substituted lines resistant and susceptible to organophosphate insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster,14676428,10.1266/ggs.78.373,"To investigate the genetic basis of the seasonal fluctuations in resistance to three organophosphates, observed within a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), we compared the intrinsic rate of increase, generation time and net reproduction rate among chromosome substitution lines derived from a resistant and a susceptible line, obtained from this natural population. There was significant variation among substituted lines; lines possessing the third chromosome from the resistant line, which confers resistance to the three organophosphates, generally showed lower mean values of these fitness measures. Chromosomal analyses also indicated significant negative contributions of the third chromosome from the resistant line. However, significant positive contributions of the interactions among chromosomes from the resistant line to these fitness measures were also detected. We further conducted a local stability analysis, in which each chromosome-substituted line was assumed to be introduced at a low frequency into the initial susceptible population. It was demonstrated that the resistance factor(s) on the third chromosome tend to decrease in their frequency under both density-independent and juvenile density-regulated conditions. Based on these results, a possible explanation for the seasonal fluctuations in resistance to the three organophosphates observed in the natural population was proposed.",2003,"Takahiro Miyo, Yuzuru Oguma, Brian Charlesworth, Takahiro Miyo, Yuzuru Oguma, Brian Charlesworth"
The Drosophila melanogaster DNA Ligase IV gene plays a crucial role in the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and acts synergistically with Rad54,14704177,,"DNA Ligase IV has a crucial role in double-strand break (DSB) repair through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). Most notably, its inactivation leads to embryonic lethality in mammals. To elucidate the role of DNA Ligase IV (Lig4) in DSB repair in a multicellular lower eukaryote, we generated viable Lig4-deficient Drosophila strains by P-element-mediated mutagenesis. Embryos and larvae of mutant lines are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation but hardly so to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or the crosslinking agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisDDP). To determine the relative contribution of NHEJ and homologous recombination (HR) in Drosophila, Lig4; Rad54 double-mutant flies were generated. Survival studies demonstrated that both HR and NHEJ have a major role in DSB repair. The synergistic increase in sensitivity seen in the double mutant, in comparison with both single mutants, indicates that both pathways partially overlap. However, during the very first hours after fertilization NHEJ has a minor role in DSB repair after exposure to ionizing radiation. Throughout the first stages of embryogenesis of the fly, HR is the predominant pathway in DSB repair. At late stages of development NHEJ also becomes less important. The residual survival of double mutants after irradiation strongly suggests the existence of a third pathway for the repair of DSBs in Drosophila.",2003,"Marcin M Gorski, Jan C J Eeken, Anja W M de Jong, Ilse Klink, Marjan Loos, Ron J Romeijn, Bert L van Veen, Leon H Mullenders, Wouter Ferro, Albert Pastink, Marcin M Gorski, Jan C J Eeken, Anja W M de Jong, Ilse Klink, Marjan Loos, Ron J Romeijn, Bert L van Veen, Leon H Mullenders, Wouter Ferro, Albert Pastink"
The large Maf factor Traffic Jam controls gonad morphogenesis in Drosophila,14578908,10.1038/ncb1058,"Interactions between somatic and germline cells are critical for the normal development of egg and sperm.

Expression of tj occurs in somatic gonadal cells that are in direct contact with germline cells throughout development. In tj mutant gonads, somatic cells fail to inter-mingle and properly envelop germline cells, causing an early block in germ cell differentiation. In addition, tj mutant somatic cells show an increase in the level of expression for several adhesion molecules. We propose that tj is a critical modulator of the adhesive properties of somatic cells, facilitating germline-soma interactions that are essential for germ cell differentiation.",2003,"Michelle A Li, Jeffrey D Alls, Rita M Avancini, Karen Koo, Dorothea Godt, Michelle A Li, Jeffrey D Alls, Rita M Avancini, Karen Koo, Dorothea Godt"

The exogenous sequences were cotranscribed at dramatically different levels which closely paralleled the level of transcription of the endogenous R1 and R2 elements. Transcription levels were inversely correlated with the number of uninserted rDNA units, variation in this number having been brought about by the R2 integration system itself. Females with as few as 20 uninserted rDNA units per X chromosome had expression levels of endogenous and exogenous insertion sequences that were 2 orders of magnitude higher than lines that contained over 80 uninserted rDNA units per chromosome. R2 insertions only 167 bp in length exhibited this range of transcriptional regulation. Analysis of transcript levels in males suggested R2 insertions on the Y chromosome are not down-regulated to the same extent as insertions on the X chromosome. These results suggest that transcription of the rDNA units can be tightly regulated, but this regulation gradually breaks down as the cell approaches the minimum number of uninserted genes needed for survival.",2003,"Danna G Eickbush, Thomas H Eickbush, Danna G Eickbush, Thomas H Eickbush"
Covariation of larval gene expression and adult body size in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,12832628,10.1093/molbev/msg179,"Understanding adaptive phenotypic variation is one of the most fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. Genes involved in adaptation are most likely those that affect traits most intimately connected to fitness: life-history traits. The genetics of quantitative trait variation (including life histories) is still poorly understood, but several studies suggest that (1) quantitative variation might be the result of variation in gene expression, rather than protein evolution, and (2) natural variation in gene expression underlies adaptation. The next step in studying the genetics of adaptive phenotypic variation is therefore an analysis of naturally occuring covariation of global gene expression and a life-history trait. Here, we report a microarray study addressing the covariation in larval gene expression and adult body weight, a life-history trait involved in adaptation. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster show adaptive geographic variation in adult body size, with larger animals at higher latitudes. Conditions during larval development also affect adult size with larger flies emerging at lower temperatures. We found statistically significant differences in normalized larval gene expression between geographic populations at one temperature (genetic variation) and within geographic populations between temperatures (developmental plasticity). Moreover, larval gene expression correlated highly with adult weight, explaining 81% of its natural variation.

Genetics of Drosophila simulans male mating discrimination in crosses with D. melanogaster,12939619,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800328,"The genetic bases of sexual isolation between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans have been mainly studied in females, and there is little information about the role of the males in interspecific mating discrimination. Using D. simulans synthetic lines with compound chromosomes from a population of the Seychelles Islands (high frequency of interspecific mating) and a multimarker strain (low frequency), we show that D. simulans males play an important role in discriminating D. melanogaster females. The genetics of male discrimination fits well with the inheritance mode of a single locus, dominant for sexual isolation, located in chromosome II near the net mutation (2L-0.0).

Sex-peptides: seminal peptides of the Drosophila male,14504657,10.1007/s00018-003-3052,"Mating affects the reproductive behaviour of insect females: the egg-laying rate increases and courting males are rejected. These post-mating responses are induced mainly by seminal fluid. In Drosophila melanogaster, males transfer two peptides (sex-peptides, = Sps) that reduce receptivity and elicit increased egg laying in their mating partners. Similarities in the open reading frames of the genes suggest that they have arisen by gene duplication. In females, Sps bind to specific sites in the central and peripheral nervous system, and to the genital tract. The binding proteins of the nervous system and genital tract are membrane proteins, but they differ molecularly. The former protein is proposed to be a receptor located at the top of a signalling cascade leading to the two post-mating responses, whereas the latter is a carrier protein moving Sps from the genital tract into the haemolymph. Sps bind to sperm. Together with sperm they are responsible for the persistence of the two post-mating responses.

"Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans rescue strains produce fit offspring, despite divergent centromere-specific histone alleles",12815450,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800275,"The interaction between rapidly evolving centromere sequences and conserved kinetochore machinery appears to be mediated by centromere-binding proteins. A recent theory proposes that the independent evolution of centromere-binding proteins in isolated populations may be a universal cause of speciation among eukaryotes. In Drosophila the centromere-specific histone, Cid (centromere identifier), shows extensive sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and the D. simulans clade, indicating that centromere machinery incompatibilities may indeed be involved in reproductive isolation and speciation. However, it is presently unclear whether the adaptive evolution of Cid was a cause of the divergence between these species, or merely a product of postspeciation adaptation in the separate lineages. Furthermore, the extent to which divergent centromere identifier proteins provide a barrier to reproduction remains unknown. Interestingly, a small number of rescue lines from both D. melanogaster and D. simulans can restore hybrid fitness. Through comparisons of cid sequence between nonrescue and rescue strains, we show that cid is not involved in restoring hybrid viability or female fertility. Further, we demonstrate that divergent cid alleles are not sufficient to cause inviability or female sterility in hybrid crosses. Our data do not dispute the rapid divergence of cid or the coevolution of centromeric components in Drosophila; however, they do suggest that cid underwent adaptive evolution after D. melanogaster and D. simulans diverged and, consequently, is not a speciation gene.",2003,"A Sainz, J A Wilder, M Wolf, H Hollocher"

We designed a five-degrees-of-freedom robotic system that serves as a novel simulation/mobile robot hybrid.

Rapid divergence of microsatellite abundance among species of Drosophila,12777536,10.1093/molbev/msg137,"Among major taxonomic groups, microsatellites exhibit considerable variation in composition and allele length, but they also show considerable conservation within many major groups. This variation may be explained by slow microsatellite evolution so that all species within a group have similar patterns of variation, or by taxon-specific mutational or selective constraints. Unfortunately, comparing microsatellites across species and studies can be problematic because of biases that may exist among different isolation and analysis protocols. We present microsatellite data from five Drosophila species in the Drosophila subgenus: D. arizonae, D. mojavensis, and D. pachea (three cactophilic species), and D. neotestacea and D. recens (two mycophagous species), all isolated at the same time using identical protocols. For each species, we compared the relative abundance of motifs, the distribution of repeat size, and the average number of repeats. Dimers were the most abundant microsatellites for each species. However, we found considerable variation in the relative abundance of motif size classes among species, even between sister taxa. Frequency differences among motifs within size classes for the three cactophilic species, but not the two mycophagous species, are consistent with other studied Drosophila. Frequency distributions of repeat number, as well as mean size, show significant differences among motif size classes but not across species. Sizes of microsatellites in these five species are consistent with D. virilis, another species in the subgenus Drosophila, but they have consistently higher means than in D. melanogaster, in the subgenus Sophophora. These results confirm that many aspects of microsatellite variation evolve quickly but also are subject to taxon-specific constraints. In addition, the nature of microsatellite evolution is dependent on temporal and taxonomic scales, and some variation is conserved across broad taxonomic levels despite relatively high rates of mutation for these loci.",2003,"Charles L Ross, Kelly A Dyer, Tamar Erez, Susan J Miller, John Jaenike, Therese A Markow, Charles L Ross, Kelly A Dyer, Tamar Erez, Susan J Miller, John Jaenike, Therese A Markow"
Characterisation of Drosophila thrombospondin defines an early origin of pentameric thrombospondins,12691755,10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00248-1,"Thrombospondins (TSPs) are multidomain oligomers that have complex roles in cell interactions and tissue organisation. The five vertebrate TSPs comprise two subgroups, A and B, that are assembled as trimers or pentamers, respectively. An invertebrate TSP was recently discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, but there is no knowledge of the oligomerisation status or properties of this molecule. We developed by bioinformatics a new dataset containing the single TSP of Drosophila melanogaster and four other newly identified invertebrate TSPs to examine the phylogenetic relationships of TSPs. These analyses clearly indicate pentamerisation as an early attribute of TSPs. We demonstrate experimentally that D.melanogaster TSP is assembled as a pentamer, has heparin-binding activity and is a component of extracellular matrix (ECM). During embryogenesis, the TSP transcript is concentrated at muscle attachment sites and is expressed by a subset of myoblasts and in imaginal discs. These novel results establish TSPs as highly conserved ECM components in both invertebrates and vertebrates and open fresh perspectives on the conservation of structure and biological function within this family.",2003,"Josephine C Adams, Raymond Monk, Amanda L Taylor, Suat Ozbek, Nora Fascetti, Stefan Baumgartner, Juergen Engel"
Dominance of mutations affecting viability in Drosophila melanogaster,12702680,,"There have been several attempts to estimate the average dominance (ratio of heterozygous to homozygous effects) of spontaneous deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster, but these have given inconsistent results. We investigated whether transposable element (TE) insertions have higher average dominance for egg-to-adult viability than do point mutations, a possibility suggested by the types of fitness-depressing effects that TEs are believed to have. If so, then variation in dominance estimates among strains and crosses would be expected as a consequence of variation in TE activity. As a first test, we estimated the average dominance of all mutations and of copia insertions in a set of lines that had accumulated spontaneous mutations for 33 generations. A traditional regression method gave a dominance estimate for all mutations of 0.17, whereas average dominance of copia insertions was 0.51; the difference between these two estimates approached significance (P = 0.08). As a second test, we reanalyzed Ohnishi 1974 data on dominance of spontaneous and EMS-induced mutations. Because a considerable fraction of spontaneous mutations are caused by TE insertions, whereas EMS induces mainly point mutations, we predicted that average dominance would decline with increasing EMS concentration. This pattern was observed, but again fell short of formal significance (P = 0.07). Taken together, however, the two results give modest support for the hypothesis that TE insertions have greater average dominance in their viability effects than do point mutations, possibly as a result of deleterious effects of expression of TE-encoded genes.",2003,"James D Fry, Sergey V Nuzhdin, James D Fry, Sergey V Nuzhdin"

Here we identify Nck beta as a phosphorylation-dependent, Dab1-interacting protein. The SH2 domain of Nck beta but not Nck alpha binds Dab1 phosphorylated on the Reelin-regulated site, Y220, or on Y232. Nck beta is coexpressed with Dab1 in the developing brain and in cultured neurons, where Reelin stimulation leads to the redistribution of Nck beta from the cell soma into neuronal processes. We found that tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1 in synergy with Nck beta disrupts the actin cytoskeleton in transfected cells. In Drosophila melanogaster, exogenous expression of mouse Dab1 causes tyrosine phosphorylation site-dependent morphological changes in the compound eye. This phenotype is enhanced by overexpression of the Drosophila Nck protein Dock, suggesting a conserved interaction between the Disabled and Nck family members. We suggest a model in which Dab1 phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of Nck beta to the membrane, where it acts to remodel the actin cytoskeleton.",2003,"AlbÃ©na Pramatarova, Pawel G Ochalski, Kelian Chen, Andrea Gropman, Sage Myers, Kyung-Tai Min, Brian W Howell, AlbÃ©na Pramatarova, Pawel G Ochalski, Kelian Chen, Andrea Gropman, Sage Myers, Kyung-Tai Min, Brian W Howell"
Telomeric position effect in drosophila melanogaster reflects a telomere length control mechanism,12723711,10.1023/a:1022925003172,"The terminal DNA arrays on chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster are composed of two families of non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART. Available evidence suggests that chromosome length in this species and its close relatives is maintained by targeted transposition of these elements, with attachment of the elements to the chromosome end by their 3' oligo(A) tails. However, the regulation of transposition of these elements and the control of telomere length are poorly understood. Here we present the hypothesis that the forces involved in telomere length regulation in Drosophila are the underlying forces that manifest themselves as telomeric position effect (TPE). Based on recent studies of TPE, which found that expression of a reporter gene is influenced by telomere structure in cis and trans, we propose that the subtelomeric satellite (TAS) in D. melanogaster plays an important role in controlling telomere elongation. Transcription of a HeT-A element is probably initiated at a promoter in the 3' UTR of an upstream element, and TAS may repress this transcriptional activity in cis and trans. A region of HeT-A not at the extreme 3' end of the element may act as a transcriptional enhancer that may be modulated by TAS.",2003,"James M Mason, Alexander Y Konev, Harald Biessmann, James M Mason, Alexander Y Konev, Harald Biessmann"

Here we report the definition of sequence criteria that distinguish PRE/TREs from non-PRE/TREs. Using this approach for genome-wide PRE/TRE prediction, we identify 167 candidate PRE/TREs, which map to genes involved in development and cell proliferation. We show that candidate PRE/TREs are bound and regulated by Polycomb proteins in vivo, thus demonstrating the validity of PRE/TRE prediction.

Analysis of a shift in codon usage in Drosophila,15008418,10.1007/s00239-003-0030-3,"In order to gain further insight into a shift in codon usage first observed in Drosophila willistoni we have analyzed seven genes in six species in the lineage leading to D. willistoni. This lineage contains the willistoni and saltans species groups. Sequences were obtained from GenBank or newly sequenced for this study. All species studied showed significant difference in codon usage compared to D. melanogaster for about one third of all amino acids. Within the willistoni/saltans lineage, codon usage is homogeneous, indicating that the shift in codon usage occurred prior to the diversification of extant species in this lineage which we estimate to date to about 20 million years ago. Thus the shift is old and has been stable. We also examined introns from these genes and the G/C composition at four-fold degenerate sites in an effort to detect a change in mutation bias. There is little or no evidence for a difference in mutation bias compared to D. melanogaster. We also considered whether relaxed selection (possibly due to reduced population sizes) or reduced recombination (due to numerous naturally occurring inversions) could account for the shift and concluded these factors alone are insufficient to explain the patterns observed. A change in the relative abundance of isoaccepting tRNAs is one of the few explanations that can account for the observations. Particularly intriguing is the fact that the greatest changes in codon usage have occurred for amino acids with two-fold C/T ending codons for which it is known that posttranscriptional modification occurs in tRNAs from a G in the wobble position to Queuosine that changes optimal binding from C to a slight preference for U. However, we do not argue that this shift was adaptive in nature, rather it may be an example of a ""frozen accident.""",2003,"Jeffrey R Powell, Erminia Sezzi, Etsuko N Moriyama, Jennifer M Gleason, Adalgisa Caccone, Jeffrey R Powell, Erminia Sezzi, Etsuko N Moriyama, Jennifer M Gleason, Adalgisa Caccone"

We recorded changes in stroke kinematics in response to mechanical and visual rotations delivered within a flight simulator.

For example, in a number of plant and animal species, multiple isoforms of several proteasome subunits, encoded by paralogous genes, have been discovered, and in some cases, these alternative isoforms have been shown to be functionally distinct from their conventional counterparts. A particularly striking example of this phenomenon is seen in Drosophila melanogaster, where 12 of the 33 subunits that make up the 26S proteasome holoenzyme are represented in the genome by multiple paralogous genes.

In this manuscript, we present the first quantitative screen of the entire genome of Drosophila for novel regulators of JNK activity in the IMD pathway. We identified a large number of gene products that negatively or positively impact on JNK activation in the IMD pathway. In particular, we identified the Pvr receptor tyrosine kinase as a potent inhibitor of JNK activation. In a series of in vivo and cell culture assays, we demonstrated that activation of the IMD pathway drives JNK-dependent expression of the Pvr ligands, Pvf2 and Pvf3, which in turn act through the Pvr/ERK MAP kinase pathway to attenuate the JNK and NF-kappaB arms of the IMD pathway.

Molecular evolution and functional diversification of fatty acid desaturases after recurrent gene duplication in Drosophila,19307313,10.1093/molbev/msp057,"Frequent gene duplications in the genome incessantly supply new genetic materials for functional innovation presumably driven by positive Darwinian selection. This mechanism in the desaturase gene family has been proposed to be important in triggering the pheromonal diversification in insects. With the recent completion of a dozen Drosophila genomes, a genome-wide perspective is possible. In this study, we first identified homologs of desaturase genes in 12 Drosophila species and noted that while gene duplication events are relatively frequent, gene losses are not scarce, especially in the desat1-desat2-desatF clade. By reconciling the gene tree with species phylogeny and the chromosomal synteny of the sequenced Drosophila genomes, at least one gene loss in desat2 and a minimum of six gene gains (resulting in seven desatF homologs, alpha-eta), three gene losses and one relocation in desatF were inferred. Upon branching off the ancestral desat1 lineage, both desat2 and desatF gained novel functions through accelerating protein evolution. The amino acid residues under positive selection located near the catalytic sites and the C-terminal region might be responsible for altered substrate selectivity between closely related species. The association between the expression pattern of desatF-alpha and the chemical composition of cuticular hydrocarbons implies that the ancestral function of desatF-alpha is the second desaturation at the four carbons after the first double bond in diene synthesis, and the shift from bisexual to female-specific expression in desatF-alpha occurred in the ancestral lineage of Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. A relationship between the number of expressed desatF homologs and the diene diversification has also been observed.

Novel sequencing strategy for repetitive DNA in a Drosophila BAC clone reveals that the centromeric region of the Y chromosome evolved from a telomere,19237394,10.1093/nar/gkp085,"The centromeric and telomeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes is mainly composed of middle-repetitive elements, such as transposable elements and tandemly repeated DNA sequences. Because of this repetitive nature, Whole Genome Shotgun Projects have failed in sequencing these regions. We describe a novel kind of transposon-based approach for sequencing highly repetitive DNA sequences in BAC clones. The key to this strategy relies on physical mapping the precise position of the transposon insertion, which enables the correct assembly of the repeated DNA. We have applied this strategy to a clone from the centromeric region of the Y chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. The analysis of the complete sequence of this clone has allowed us to prove that this centromeric region evolved from a telomere, possibly after a pericentric inversion of an ancestral telocentric chromosome. Our results confirm that the use of transposon-mediated sequencing, including positional mapping information, improves current finishing strategies.

Here conditional over-expression of both wild-type and mutant p53 transgenes indicated that, in adult flies, p53 limits life span in females but favors life span in males. In contrast, during larval development, moderate over-expression of p53 produced both male and female adults with increased life span. Mutations of the endogenous p53 gene also had sex-specific effects on life span under control and stress conditions: null mutation of p53 increased life span in females, and had smaller, more variable effects in males.

      Understanding developmental processes and building towards integrative systems biology require detailed knowledge of the spatio-temporal expression of genes and proteins. We have developed a software package for collecting, storing and searching the annotation of protein or gene expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster. Using standard Drosophila anatomy and Gene Ontologies, the system can readily capture expression patterns at any stage of development and in all recognized tissue types as well as details of sub-cellular localization. The web-based system allows multiple groups to work in collaboration and share images and annotation.

D. melanogaster LTR-retrotransposons are divided in three groups: gypsy (one, two or three open reading frames - ORFs), copia (one ORF), BEL (one ORF). Gypsy group is divided into three subgroups. Subgroup I is underrepresented by retrotransposons-retroviruses with three ORFs and their derivatives which have lost the env gene (ORF3). Subgroup II is underrepresented by retrotransposons with two ORFs, subgroup III - by retrotransposons with one ORF. Comparative analysis of homologs of gypsy group LTR-retrotransposons evidences that subgroups I and II are only in genomes of Lepidoptera and Diptera. Gypsy group of LTR-retrotransposons with one and two ORFs are found in almost all genomes of arthropods. Most of the families of D. melanogaster gypsy group LTR-retrotransposons have close homologs in genomes of other species of drosophila. A degree of identity of retrotransposons sequences is correlated with a degree of relation between species of drosophila; it's evidences about vertical transmission of retrotransposons. Obvious cases of horizontal transfer of some mobile elements have been detected including retrotransposons without the env gene. Homologs of distinct ORFs of retrotransposons - genes gag and env - have been found.

To explain this paradox, theory predicts that such strains should provide a fitness benefit, but to date none has been detected. Recently completed genome sequences of different Wolbachia strains show that these bacteria may have the genetic machinery to influence iron utilization of hosts. Here we show that Wolbachia infection can confer a positive fecundity benefit for Drosophila melanogaster reared on iron-restricted or -overloaded diets. Furthermore, iron levels measured from field-collected flies indicated that nutritional conditions in the field were overall comparable to those of flies reared in the laboratory on restricted diets.

Furthermore, several years ago, we have also started an experimental ""Darwinian"" selection to generate a fly strain that can perpetuate through all of its life cycle stages in hypoxic environments. Through microarrays and bioinformatic analyses, we have obtained genes (e.g. Notch pathway genes) that play an important role in hypoxia resistance. In addition, we also detail a proof of principle that Drosophila genes that are beneficial in fly resistance to hypoxia can also be as well in mammalian cells. We believe that the mechanisms that we are uncovering in Drosophila will allow us to gain insight regarding susceptibility and tolerance to low O2 and will therefore pave the way to develop better therapies for ailments that afflict humans as a consequence of low O2 delivery or low blood O2 levels.",2009,"Dan Zhou, Deeann W Visk, Gabriel G Haddad, Dan Zhou, Deeann W Visk, Gabriel G Haddad"

Toxicities of 31 volatile low molecular weight compounds against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus,19351084,10.1603/033.046.0218,"This research studied 31 volatile compounds for indoor control of the medically important mosquitoes Aedes aegypti L. and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. Only adult female mosquitoes were tested. The test compounds were from six families that included five heterobicyclics, eight formate esters, formic acid (a hydrolyzed metabolite of formate esters), eight acetate esters, four propionate esters, three butyrate esters, and two valerate esters. Also, the organophosphate compound dichlorvos (DDVP) was tested as a positive control. Cx. quinquefasciatus was generally more susceptible than Ae. aegypti. Cx. quinquefasciatus was most susceptible to a subset of heterobicyclics and formate esters (rank: n-butyl formate > hexyl formate = dihydrobenzofuran = menthofuran = heptyl formate = ethyl formate). Ae. aegypti was most susceptible to a subset of formate esters (rank: methyl > n-butyl > propyl = ethyl = hexyl). The most active materials against both species had LC50s of 0.4-1 mg active ingredient per 0.5 liter of air volume (0.8-2 mg/liter), which is 50- to 60-fold less toxic than dichlorvos (an organophosphate insecticide that is being phased out from indoor use). In relation to Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, both mosquito species were generally more susceptible to formate esters but more tolerant of heterobicyclics. Generally, the most toxic compound against all dipterans tested to date is n-butyl formate, whereas menthofuran is additionally toxic against Cx. quinquefasciatus and D. melanogaster.

Hybridization tests using D. melanogaster deficiencies that include tan show no evidence that this locus is involved in the lighter pigmentation of D. santomea females; rather, the pigmentation difference appears to involve at least four other loci in the region.

Odor-mediated aggregation enhances the colonization ability of Drosophila melanogaster,18801375,10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.08.019,"Animal aggregation is a general phenomenon in ecological systems. Aggregations are generally considered as an evolutionary advantageous state in which members derive the benefits of mate choice and protection against natural enemies, balanced by the costs of limiting resources and intraspecific competition. Many insects use chemical information to find conspecifics and to form aggregations. In this study, we describe a spatio-temporal simulation model designed to explore and quantify the effects of the strength of chemical attraction, on the colonization ability of a fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) population. We found that the use of infochemicals is crucial for colonizing an area. Fruit flies subject to an Allee effect that are unable to respond to chemical information could not successfully colonize the area and went extinct within four generations. This was mainly caused by very high mortality due to the Allee effect. Even when the Allee effect did not play a role, the random dispersing population had more difficulties in colonizing the area and is doomed to extinction in the long run. When fruit flies had the ability to respond to chemical information, they successfully colonized the orchard. This happened faster, for stronger attraction to chemical information. In addition, more fruit flies were able to find the resources and the settlement on the resources was much higher. This resulted in a reduced mortality due to the Allee effect for fruit flies able to respond to chemical information. Odor-mediated aggregation thus enhances the colonization ability of D. melanogaster. Even a weak attraction to chemical information paved the way to successfully colonize the orchard.",2009,"Marjolein E Lof, Maarten de Gee, Lia Hemerik, Marjolein E Lof, Maarten de Gee, Lia Hemerik"
Cis-regulatory variation is typically polyallelic in Drosophila,19064705,10.1534/genetics.108.098459,"Gene expression levels vary heritably, with approximately 25-35% of the loci affecting expression acting in cis. We characterized standing cis-regulatory variation among 16 wild-derived strains of Drosophila melanogaster.

We observed concordant, significant differential allelic expression (DAE) in 7/10 genes queried with multiple SNPs, and every member of a set of eight additional, one-assay genes suggest significant DAE. Four of the high-confidence, multiple-assay genes harbor three or more statistically distinguishable allelic classes, often at intermediate frequency. Numerous intermediate-frequency, detectable regulatory polymorphisms cast doubt on a model in which cis-acting variation is a product of deleterious mutations of large effect. Comparing our data to predictions of population genetics theory using coalescent simulations, we estimate that a typical gene harbors 7-15 cis-regulatory sites (nucleotides) at which a selectively neutral mutation would elicit an observable expression phenotype.

Neurocircuit assays for seizures in epilepsy mutants of Drosophila,19369924,10.3791/1121,"Drosophila melanogaster is a useful tool for studying seizure like activity. A variety of mutants in which seizures can be induced through either physical shock or electrical stimulation is available for study of various aspects of seizure activity and behavior. All flies, including wild-type, will undergo seizure-like activity if stimulated at a high enough voltage. Seizure like activity is an all-or-nothing response and each genotype has a specific seizure threshold. The seizure threshold of a specific genotype of fly can be altered either by treatment with a drug or by genetic suppression or enhancement. The threshold is easily measured by electrophysiology. Seizure-like activity can be induced via high frequency electrical stimulation delivered directly to the brain and recorded through the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs) in the thorax.

We showed that the comb and other contiguous bristle formations assemble from noncontiguous precursor cells, which join together through intercalation. Most of the rotation of the SC (which has a longitudinal orientation in D. melanogaster but is initially transverse) occurs after this stage, when the structure is a single unit. We have provided evidence that male-specific convergent extension through cell rearrangement is responsible for both this rotation and another sexually dimorphic bristle trait. Contiguous bristle formations act as barriers to cell movement within the epithelium, and we demonstrated that a particularly rapid rotation of the proximal region of the comb is associated with the presence of a constricted area between a portion of the SC and a transverse row of contiguous bristle precursors. Our results suggest that the cell dynamics in the neighborhood of the SC may have biased its evolution.",2009,"Joel Atallah, Nana Hou Liu, Peter Dennis, Andy Hon, Dorothea Godt, Ellen W Larsen, Joel Atallah, Nana Hou Liu, Peter Dennis, Andy Hon, Dorothea Godt, Ellen W Larsen"

In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster's afadin homologue Canoe (Cno) has suggested roles in signal transduction during morphogenesis. We completely removed Cno from embryos, testing these hypotheses. Surprisingly, Cno is not essential for AJ assembly or for AJ maintenance in many tissues. However, morphogenesis is impaired from the start. Apical constriction of mesodermal cells initiates but is not completed. The actomyosin cytoskeleton disconnects from AJs, uncoupling actomyosin constriction and cell shape change. Cno has multiple direct interactions with AJ proteins, but is not a core part of the cadherin-catenin complex. Instead, Cno localizes to AJs by a Rap1- and actin-dependent mechanism.

Second, repeated cocaine administration induces behavioral sensitization a form of behavioral plasticity believed to underlie certain aspects of addiction. Third, a key role for dopaminergic systems in mediating cocaine's effects has been demonstrated through both pharmacological and genetic methods.

Public versus personal information for mate copying in an invertebrate,19361993,10.1016/j.cub.2009.02.064,"Organisms require information to make decisions about fitness-affecting resources, such as mates. Animals may extract ""personal information"" about potential mates by observing their physical characteristics or extract additional ""public information"" by observing their mating performance [1]. Mate copying by females [2-6] is a form of public information use that may reduce uncertainty about male quality, allowing more adaptive choices [2]. Experimental studies have produced evidence that female mate copying occurs in several species of fish [3], birds [5-7], and mammals [8], including humans [9]. We report the first evidence that a female invertebrate can exploit public information to select mates. In a first experiment, Drosophila melanogaster female prospectors increased their time in the attraction zones of poor-condition males, but not of good-condition males, after having observed them with a model female. This suggests that females appraised prospective mates by exploiting public information and did so mainly when it contrasted with personal information. In a second experiment, prospector females preferably mated with males of the color type they had previously observed copulating over males of the rejected color type, suggesting that female Drosophila can generalize socially learned information. The complexity of Drosophila decision-making suggests an unprecedented level of cognition in invertebrates.

Two interacting olfactory transduction mechanisms have linked polarities and dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster antennal basiconic sensilla neurons,19403747,10.1152/jn.00162.2009,"We measured frequency response functions between concentrations of fruit odorants and individual action potentials in large basiconic sensilla of the Drosophila melanogaster antenna. A new method of randomly varying odorant concentration was combined with rapid, continuous measurement of concentration at the antenna by a miniature photoionization detector. All frequency responses decreased progressively at frequencies approaching 100 Hz, providing an upper limit for the dynamics of Drosophila olfaction. We found two distinct response patterns: excitatory band-pass frequency responses were seen with ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and hexanol, whereas inhibitory low-pass responses were seen with methyl salicylate and phenylethyl acetate. Band-pass responses peaked at 1-10 Hz. Frequency responses could be well fitted by simple linear filter equations, and the fitted parameters were consistent within each of the two types of responses. Experiments with equal mixtures of excitatory and inhibitory odorants gave responses that were characteristic of the inhibitory components, indicating that interaction during transduction causes inhibitory odorants to suppress the responses to excitatory odorants. Plots of response amplitude versus odorant concentration indicated that the odorant concentrations used were within approximately linear regions of the dose response relationships. We also estimated linear information capacity from the coherence function of each recording. Although coherence was relatively high, indicating a large signal-to-noise ratio, information capacity for olfaction was much lower than comparable estimates for mechanotransduction or visual transduction because of the limited bandwidth of olfaction. These data offer new insights into transduction by primary chemoreceptors and place temporal constraints on Drosophila olfactory behavior.",2009,"Julia Schuckel, PÃ¤ivi H Torkkeli, Andrew S French, Julia Schuckel, PÃ¤ivi H Torkkeli, Andrew S French"
Life span alteration after irradiation in Drosophila melanogaster strains with mutations of Hsf and Hsps,18551381,10.1007/s10522-008-9147-5,"The life span alteration after gamma-irradiation and/or paraquat treatment in Drosophila in wild type strain Canton-S and strains with mutations of heat shock factor (1-4 alleles) and heat shock proteins (Hsp70Ba ( 304 ), Hsp83 ( e6A ), Hsp22 ( EY09909 ), Hsp67Bb ( EY099099 )) was investigated. Chronic low-dose rate gamma-irradiation (0.017 and 0.17 cGy/h) on pre-imago stages was used as a priming dose (absorbed doses were 4 and 40 cGy). Paraquat, a free radical inducing agent, was a challenging factor (20 mM for 1 day). It was shown that chronic irradiation led to adaptive response in both sexes except homozygous males and females with mutations of Hsf ( 4 ) and Hsp70Ba ( 304 ). The gender-specific differences in stress response were discovered in wild type strain Canton-S, Hsp22 ( EY09909 ) Hsp67Bb ( EY09909 ) homozygotes and Hsp83 ( e6A ) heterozygotes: the adaptive response persisted in males, but not in females. Thus, Drosophila Hsp and Hsf mutation homozygotes did not demonstrate the adaptive response in the majority of cases, implying an important role of those genes in radiation hormesis and adaptation to stresses.",2009,"A Moskalev, M Shaposhnikov, E Turysheva, A Moskalev, M Shaposhnikov, E Turysheva"
Environmental control of ovarian dormancy in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,19669646,10.1007/s00359-009-0460-5,"Drosophila melanogaster from Australia, Europe and North America enter an adult ovarian dormancy in response to short days and low temperatures. The independent effects of temperature and day length in the determination of dormancy have been examined only in one long-established laboratory line (Canton-S). In all other studies of natural or laboratory populations, dormancy has been assessed at either a single short day or a single moderately low temperature. Herein, we determine the relative roles of temperature, photoperiod, and their interaction in the control of ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster from two natural populations representing latitudinal extremes in eastern North America (Florida at 27 degrees N and Maine at 44 degrees N). In both natural populations, temperature is the main determinant of dormancy, alone explaining 67% of the total variation among replicate isofemale lines, whereas photoperiod has no significant effect. We conclude that ovarian dormancy in D. melanogaster is a temperature-initiated syndrome of winter-tolerant traits that represents an adaptive phenotypic plasticity in temperate seasonal environments.",2009,"Kevin J Emerson, Alison M Uyemura, Keely L McDaniel, Paul S Schmidt, William E Bradshaw, Christina M Holzapfel"
Novel genomic cDNA hybrids produce effective RNA interference in adult Drosophila,11804566,10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00560-3,"Drosophila melanogaster has been a premier genetic model system for nearly 100 years, yet lacks a simple method to disrupt gene expression. Here, we show genomic cDNA fusions predicted to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) following splicing, effectively silencing expression of target genes in adult transgenic animals. We targeted three Drosophila genes: lush, white, and dGq(alpha). In each case, target gene expression is dramatically reduced, and the white RNAi phenotype is indistinguishable from a deletion mutant. This technique efficiently targets genes expressed in neurons, a tissue refractory to RNAi in C. elegans. These results demonstrate a simple strategy to knock out gene function in specific cells in living adult Drosophila that can be applied to define the biological function of hundreds of orphan genes and open reading frames.",2002,"Savitha Kalidas, Dean P Smith, Savitha Kalidas, Dean P Smith"
Mutations in Drosophila myb lead to centrosome amplification and genomic instability,11807028,,"We have previously established that the single myb gene in Drosophila melanogaster, Dm myb, which is related to the proto-oncogene Myb, is required for the G2/M transition of the cell cycle and for suppression of endoreduplication in pupal wing cells. We now report that studies of the abdominal phenotype in loss-of-function Dm myb mutants reveal additional roles for Dm myb in the cell cycle, specifically in mitosis. Abdominal epidermal cells that are mutant for Dm myb proliferate more slowly than wild-type controls throughout pupation, with particularly sluggish progression through the early stages of mitosis. Abnormal mitoses associated with multiple functional centrosomes, unequal chromosome segregation, formation of micronuclei, and/or failure to complete cell division are common in the later cell cycles of mutant cells. Resulting nuclei are often aneuploid and/or polyploid. Similar defects have also been observed in loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor genes p53, Brca1 and Brca2. These data demonstrate that in abdominal epidermal cells, Dm myb is required to sustain the appropriate rate of proliferation, to suppress formation of supernumerary centrosomes, and to maintain genomic integrity.",2002,"Siau-Min Fung, Gary Ramsay, Alisa L Katzen, Siau-Min Fung, Gary Ramsay, Alisa L Katzen"
Pharmacological evidence for GABAergic regulation of specific behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster,11810639,10.1002/neu.10030,"We have identified several GABAergic-modulated behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster by employing a pharmacological approach to disrupt GABA transporter function in vivo. Systemic treatment of adult female flies with the GABA transport inhibitors DL-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DABA) or R,S-nipecotic acid (NipA), resulted in diminished locomotor activity, deficits in geotaxis, and the induction of convulsive behaviors with a secondary loss of the righting reflex. Pharmacological evidence suggested that the observed behavioral phenotypes were specific to disruption of GABA transporter function and GABAergic activity. The effects of GABA reuptake inhibitors on locomotor activity were dose dependent, pharmacologically distinct, and paralleled their known effects in mammalian systems. Recovery of normal locomotor activity and the righting reflex in DABA- and NipA-treated flies was achieved by coadministration of bicuculline (BIC), a GABA receptor antagonist that supresses GABAergic activity in mammals. Recovery of these behaviors was also achieved by coadministration of gabapentin, an anticonvulsant agent that interacts with mammalian GABAergic systems. Finally, behavioral effects were selective because other specific behaviors such as feeding activity and female sexual receptivity were not affected. Related pharmacological analyses performed in vitro on isolated Drosophila synaptic plasma membrane vesicles demonstrated high affinity, saturable uptake mechanisms for [3H]-GABA; further competitive inhibition studies with DABA and NipA demonstrated their ability to inhibit [3H]-GABA transport. The existence of experimentally accessible GABA transporters in Drosophila that share conserved pharmacological properties with their mammalian counterparts has resulted in the identification of specific behaviors that are modulated by GABA.",2002,"Sandra M Leal, Wendi S Neckameyer, Sandra M Leal, Wendi S Neckameyer"
Effect of low stressful temperature on genetic variation of five quantitative traits in Drosophila melanogaster,12080372,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800104,"A half-sib analysis was used to investigate genetic variation for three morphological traits (thorax length, wing length and sternopleural bristle number) and two life-history traits (developmental time and larva-to-adult viability) in Drosophila melanogaster reared at a standard (25 degrees C) and a low stressful (13 degrees C) temperature. Both phenotypic and environmental variation showed a significant increase under stressful conditions in all traits. For estimates of genetic variation, no statistically significant differences were found between the two environments. Narrow heritabilities tended to be higher at 13 degrees C for sternopleural bristle number and viability and at 25 degrees C for wing length and developmental time, whereas thorax length did not show any trend. However, the pattern of genetic variances and evolvability indices (coefficient of genetic variation and evolvability), considered in the context of literature evidence, indicated the possibility of an increase in additive genetic variation for the morphological traits and viability and in nonadditive genetic variation for developmental time. The data suggest that the effect of stressful temperature may be trait-specific and this warns against generalizations about the behaviour of genetic variation under extreme conditions.",2002,"O A Bubliy, V Loeschcke, O A Bubliy, V Loeschcke"
Identification of Drosophila melanogaster yellow-f and yellow-f2 proteins as dopachrome-conversion enzymes,12164780,10.1042/BJ20020272,"This study describes the identification of Drosophila yellow-f and yellow-f2 as dopachrome-conversion enzymes responsible for catalysing the conversion of dopachrome into 5,6-dihydroxyindole in the melanization pathway. Drosophila yellow -y gene and yellow -b, -c, -f and -f2 genes were expressed in an insect cell/baculovirus expression system and their corresponding recombinant proteins were screened for dopachrome-conversion enzyme activity. Among the yellow and yellow -related genes, the yellow -f and yellow -f2 genes were identified as the genes coding for Drosophila dopachrome-conversion enzyme based on the high activity of their recombinant proteins in catalysing the production of 5,6-dihydroxyindole from dopachrome. Both yellow-f and yellow-f2 are capable of mediating a decarboxylative structural rearrangement of dopachrome, as well as an isomerization/tautomerization of dopamine chrome and dopa methyl ester chrome. Northern hybridization revealed the transcription of yellow -f in larvae and pupae, but a high abundance of mRNA was observed in later larval and early pupal stages. In contrast, yellow-f2 transcripts were present at all stages, but high abundance of its mRNA was observed in later-stage pupae and adults. These data indicate that yellow-f and yellow-f2 complement each other during Drosophila development and that the yellow-f is involved in larval and pupal melanization, and yellow-f2 plays a major role in melanization reactions in Drosophila during later pupal and adult development. Results from this study provide the groundwork towards a better understanding of the physiological roles of the Drosophila yellow gene family.",2002,"Qian Han, Jianmin Fang, Haizhen Ding, Jody K Johnson, Bruce M Christensen, Jianyong Li, Qian Han, Jianmin Fang, Haizhen Ding, Jody K Johnson, Bruce M Christensen, Jianyong Li"
Induction of epithelial tumors in Drosophila melanogaster heterozygous for the tumor suppressor gene wts,12489118,10.1002/em.10119,"The imaginal disk cells of Drosophila have a cell cycle that is very similar to that of mammalian cells. Data concerning factors inducing tumors in these cells may directly relate to the risk of these factors for inducing cancer in humans. One of the genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle control is wts (warts), the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian tumor suppressor gene LATS1. The Drosophila wts mutations are recessive lethal. However, homozygous clones that arise in heterozygous flies in the imaginal disk cells lead to epithelial tumors, spectacular outgrowths visible on the cuticle of the adult. We have treated Drosophila larvae, heterozygous for wts, with the chemical mutagen MMS (methyl methanesulfonate) or with X-rays and measured the appearance of epithelial tumors in the eclosing adult flies. This test is a variation of the well-known Drosophila somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART), where mostly recessive markers have been used leading to visible phenotypes in the eyes and wings of the fly.

Control of oxidative stress resistance by IP3 kinase in Drosophila melanogaster,12398933,10.1016/s0891-5849(02)01019-5,"Oxidative damage is thought to be a major causal factor of aging, and is implicated in several human pathologies such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Nevertheless the genetical determinants of in vivo oxidative stress response are still poorly understood. To identify cellular components whose deregulation leads to oxidative stress resistance, we performed a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster. We thus identified in this screen Drosophila Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate kinase I (D-IP3K1), a Drosophila gene homologous to mammalian IP3Ks. In vertebrates, IP3Ks phosphorylate the second messenger Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) to produce Inositol 1,3,4,5 tetrakiphosphate (IP4). IP3 binding to its receptor (IP3R) triggers Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, whereas IP4 physiological role remains elusive. We show here that ubiquitous overexpression of D-IP3K1 confers resistance of flies to H(2)O(2)- but not to paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Additional genetic analysis with other members of IP3 and IP4 signaling pathways led us to propose that the D-IP3K1 protective effect is mainly mediated through the reduction of IP3 level (which probably results in reduced Ca(2+) release from internal stores), rather than through the rise of IP4 level.",2002,"VÃ©ronique Monnier, Fabrice Girardot, Wilfried Audin, HervÃ© Tricoire, VÃ©ronique Monnier, Fabrice Girardot, Wilfried Audin, HervÃ© Tricoire"
Overexpression of a CREB repressor isoform enhances the female sexual receptivity in Drosophila,12467339,10.1023/a:1020828227074,"The cAMP responsive transcriptional factor, CREB, is highly conserved among animal species, and its activity affects their behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, one of alternatively spliced products of the CREB gene, dCREB2-a, is a transcriptional activator, while another isoform, dCREB2-b, is a repressor of dCREB2-a. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of dCREB2-b in virgin females enhances their sexual receptivity. We studied the role of dCREB2 in female mating behavior using two transgenic lines, hs-dCREB2-a and hs-dCREB2-b, which overexpress respective products with heat-shock treatment. Wild-type males started their courtship behavior and mated more quickly with heat-shocked hs-dCREB2-b females than with non-heat-shocked hs-dCREB2-b females. Overexpression of dCREB2-a in females affected neither their courtship behavior nor mating frequency. The effects of overexpressed dCREB2-b were not due to elevated locomotor activities of heat-shocked females nor due to more vigorous courtship behavior of paired wild-type males. CREB might be involved in female sexual behavior of animals.",2002,"Takaomi Sakai, Yoshiaki Kidokoro, Takaomi Sakai, Yoshiaki Kidokoro"
Lack of hypergravity-associated longevity extension in Drosophila melanogaster flies overexpressing hsp70,12510174,10.1023/a:1021367800170,"Previous studies have shown that Drosophila melanogaster males live longer if exposed to hypergravity at young age. Similarly, thermotolerance and climbing activity in old age are enhanced and it has been hypothesized that the 70 kDa inducible heat-shock protein (hsp70) may play a role in some of these effects. In this article, longevity, thermotolerance and climbing activity were studied in transgenic flies (OE+ strain) overexpressing hsp70 and in control flies harboring the transfection vector at the same chromosomal location but no extra-copies of the hsp70 gene (OE- strain). No positive effect from exposure to hypergravity at a young age was observed for longevity and climbing activity. Thermotolerance was increased by hypergravity but to the same extent in OE+ and OE- strains. Since no positive effect from hypergravity exposure or similar effects were observed in the two strains, it may be concluded that overexpression of hsp70 does not provide an advantage to flies subjected to a mild stress and that it may not be of any help during aging.",2002,"Eric Le Bourg, Philippe Valenti, FranÃ§ois Payre, Eric Le Bourg, Philippe Valenti, FranÃ§ois Payre"

It has been suggested that the intracellular signal transduction of PBAN in B. mori involves Ca(2+), calmodulin, and calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B). We have cloned two cDNAs encoding calcineurin heterosubunits from a pheromone gland cDNA library of B. mori. The 2,996-bp clone predicts a 495-amino acid protein homologous to the catalytic subunit calcineurin A (CnA) with a molecular mass of 55,968. The deduced amino acid sequence well conserves the calcineurin B (CnB)-binding domain and two subdomains, a calmodulin-binding and an autoinhibitory domain, showing 77-85% and 82% identities to the isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster CnA and human CnA, respectively. On the other hand, the 820-bp clone predicts a 170-amino acid protein homologous to the regulatory subunit CnB with a molecular mass of 19,357. The deduced amino acid sequence well conserves four EF-hand type calcium-binding structures, showing 95% and about 85% identities to D. melanogaster CnB and mammalian CnBs, respectively. A yeast two-hybrid system has demonstrated the molecular interaction between B. mori CnA and CnB. Northern blot analyses revealed that both CnA and CnB genes were expressed in various larval and adult tissues of B. mori. Both transcripts detected in the pheromone gland three days before adult eclosion increased by the day before eclosion and the mRNA levels were found to be high even two days after adult eclosion.

A Vestigial:Scalloped TEA domain chimera rescues the wing phenotype of a scalloped mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,12001068,10.1002/gene.10086,"The development of the Drosophila wing requires both scalloped and vestigial functions. Using a fusion between full-length Vestigial and the Scalloped TEA domain, the fusion protein can rescue scalloped wing mutations because within wing development, Scalloped and Vestigial cooperatively act as a transcription complex. Scalloped provides the necessary DNA binding function via the TEA domain and Vestigial promotes the activation of target genes. We also demonstrate that the putative nuclear localization signal contained in the TEA domain of Scalloped is likely responsible for the nuclear localization of Vestigial. The fusion protein is also capable of activating a known target gene of the native complex and thus represents a tool that will be helpful in rapidly identifying target genes of the Sd/Vg complex that are involved in wing differentiation. The functionality of the fusion suggests that only the TEA domain of Scalloped is critical for wing development and the rest of the protein (about 70%) is dispensable. This result is novel and should stimulate further studies of sd in other tissues in view of the fact that scalloped is a vital gene in Drosophila.",2002,"Ajay Srivastava, Julie O MacKay, John B Bell, Ajay Srivastava, Julie O MacKay, John B Bell"

Expression of the Idefix retrotransposon in early follicle cells in the germarium of Drosophila melanogaster is determined by its LTR sequences and a specific genomic context,11976956,10.1007/s00438-002-0641-1,"Retrotransposons are transcriptionally activated in different tissues and cell types by a variety of genomic and environmental factors. Transcription of LTR retrotransposons is controlled by cis-acting regulatory sequences in the 5' LTR. Mobilization of two LTR retroelements, Idefix and ZAM, occurs in the unstable RevI line of Drosophila melanogaster, in which their copy numbers are high, while they are low in all other stocks tested. Here we show that both a full-length and a subgenomic Idefix transcript that are necessary for its mobilization are present in the Rev1 line, but not in the other lines. Studies on transgenic strains demonstrate that the 5' LTR of Idefix contains sequences that direct the tissue-specific expression of the retroelement in testes and ovaries of adult flies. In ovaries, expression occurs in the early follicle and in other somatic cells of the germarium, and is strictly associated with the unstable genetic context conferred by the RevI line.

Moreover, it can help to uncover all the metabolic routes for any molecule. Here we have used the genome of Drosophila melanogaster to search for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fucosylated glycans. Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases.

There is clear evidence that some genes can act as a reservoir of species-specific behaviour, particularly for the male actions during courtship. However, to date there has not been a single genetic locus that has been isolated at the molecular level and shown to be associated with a change in female preference. There are some promising avenues of exploration, in that recent genetic analyses suggest that a small number of genes may make major contributions to female preferences.

We investigated the mechanism of the P-element local transposition by isolating and characterizing local insertions in the male germline. We designed a genetic screen employing a marker gene that is carried in the P element and is dose sensitive. This dose effect allows isolation of flies containing newly transposed P elements in the presence of the starting element. A rapid molecular screen with PCR was used to identify 45 local insertions located within an approximately 40-kb genomic region on both sides of the starting element. Our system permits the isolation of the cluster progeny derived from a single insertion event, but none was isolated. The data suggest that local transposition occurs in the meiotic cell cycle. Nearly all of the local insertions were located within the promoter regions of the genes that were active in the male germline cells, suggesting that local insertions target predominantly active promoters.

Genetic analysis in Drosophila suggests that structural conservation also extends to the functional level. Flies carrying mutations that reduce insulin signaling have a growth deficiency phenotype similar to that seen in mice with disruptions of genes encoding insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) or the IGF-I receptor. Recent studies in flies have demonstrated a role for the insulin signaling pathway in the regulation of metabolism, reproduction and lifespan via modulation of central neuroendocrine pathways. Similarly, mice with loss of brain insulin receptors or insulin receptor substrate 2 deficiency exhibit neuroendocrine defects and female infertility. These parallels suggest that the insulin system has multiple conserved roles, acting directly to modulate growth and indirectly, via the neuroendocrine system, to modulate peripheral physiology in response to changes in nutrient availability.",2002,"Robert S Garofalo, Robert S Garofalo"
"dS6K-regulated cell growth is dPKB/dPI(3)K-independent, but requires dPDK1",11862217,10.1038/ncb763,"Genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster underscore the importance of the insulin-signalling pathway in controlling cell, organ and animal size. Effectors of this pathway include Chico (the insulin receptor substrate homologue), dPI(3)K, dPKB, dPTEN, and dS6K. Mutations in any of these components have a striking effect on cell size and number, with the exception of dS6K. Mutants in dS6K affect cell size but not cell number, seemingly consistent with arguments that dS6K is a distal effector in the signalling pathway, directly controlled by dTOR, a downstream effector of dPI(3)K and dPKB. Unexpectedly, recent studies showed that dS6K activity is unimpaired in chico-deficient larvae, suggesting that dS6K activation may be mediated through the dPI(3)K docking sites of the Drosophila insulin receptor. Here, we show genetically, pharmacologically and biochemically that dS6K resides on an insulin signalling pathway distinct from that of dPKB, and surprisingly also from that of dPI(3)K. More striking, despite dPKB-dPI(3)K-independence, dS6K activity is dependent on the Drosophila homologue of the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1, dPDK1, demonstrating that both dPDK1, as well as dTOR, mediated dS6K activation is phosphatidylinositide-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)-independent.",2002,"Thomas Radimerski, Jacques Montagne, Felix Rintelen, Hugo Stocker, Jeroen van der Kaay, C Peter Downes, Ernst Hafen, George Thomas, Thomas Radimerski, Jacques Montagne, Felix Rintelen, Hugo Stocker, Jeroen van der Kaay, C Peter Downes, Ernst Hafen, George Thomas"
A trithorax-group complex purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for methylation of histone H3,11752412,10.1073/pnas.221596698,"Histone methylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating the transcriptional accessibility of chromatin. Several methyltransferases have been shown to target histone amino-terminal tails and mark nucleosomes associated with either euchromatic or heterochromatic states. However, the biochemical machinery responsible for regulating histone methylation and integrating it with other cellular events has not been well characterized. We report here the purification, molecular identification, and genetic and biochemical characterization of the Set1 protein complex that is necessary for methylation of histone H3 at lysine residue 4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The seven-member 363-kDa complex contains homologs of Drosophila melanogaster proteins Ash2 and Trithorax and Caenorhabditis elegans protein DPY-30, which are implicated in the maintenance of Hox gene expression and regulation of X chromosome dosage compensation, respectively. Mutations of Set1 protein comparable to those that disrupt developmental function of its Drosophila homolog Trithorax abrogate histone methylation in yeast. These studies suggest that epigenetic regulation of developmental and sex-specific gene expression are species-specific readouts for a common chromatin remodeling machinery associated mechanistically with histone methylation.",2002,"Peter L Nagy, Joachim Griesenbeck, Roger D Kornberg, Michael L Cleary, Peter L Nagy, Joachim Griesenbeck, Roger D Kornberg, Michael L Cleary"
DNA sequence variation at a duplicated gene: excess of replacement polymorphism and extensive haplotype structure in the Drosophila melanogaster bicoid region,12082119,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004179,"The bicoid (bcd) gene of Drosophila has played an important role in understanding the system of developmental regulatory genes that controls segmentation in the fruit fly. Several studies in Drosophila and closely related insects suggest that bcd may be the result of a gene duplication in the Dipteran lineage. In addition, the presence of a large, conserved secondary structure in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) makes the bcd gene a good candidate for studying compensatory evolution and the relationship between RNA secondary structure and patterns of standing variation in natural populations. Despite these interesting aspects, a population-level analysis has until now not been performed on bcd. In this study, DNA sequence variation was examined for a 4-kb region of the bcd gene, including a portion of the 5' UTR, the entire coding region, and the 3' UTR, for 25 Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines from Zimbabwe and one allele from D. simulans. Statistical tests revealed a significant excess of replacement polymorphisms in the D. melanogaster lineage that are clustered in two putative linker regions of the Bicoid protein. This result is consistent with a relaxation of selective constraints in these regions. In addition, we found a distinct haplotype structure and a significantly smaller number of haplotypes than predicted by the standard neutral model. It is unlikely that the haplotype structure is maintained by epistatic selection acting on the secondary structure in the 3' UTR or by the association of the bcd gene with polymorphic inversions. Instead, our two main observations, namely the occurrence of a haplotype structure and the excess of replacement polymorphisms, may indicate that the selective history of this gene is rather complex, involving both the relaxation of purifying selection in some parts of the protein and the action of positive selection in other parts of the gene region.",2002,"John F Baines, Ying Chen, Aparup Das, Wolfgang Stephan, John F Baines, Ying Chen, Aparup Das, Wolfgang Stephan"
Influence of sodium arsenite on the genotoxicity of potassium dichromate and ethyl methanesulfonate: studies with the wing spot test in Drosophila,11813296,10.1002/em.10042,"The wing spot test in Drosophila melanogaster was used to investigate the genotoxicity of arsenic and its effects on the action of two clearly genotoxic agents: potassium dichromate (PDC) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). This assay is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of the suitable recessive markers multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)) can lead to the formation of mutant clones of larval cells, which are then expressed as spots on the wings of adult flies. These spots can be attributed to different genotoxic events: either mitotic recombination or mutation (deletion, point mutation, and specific types of translocation). Pretreatments and chronic cotreatments were comparatively used for combined treatments. From the results obtained it is evident that sodium arsenite (SA) does not increase the frequency of any of the three categories of spots recorded (small, large, and twin spots) at the concentrations tested. The effects of SA in combination with PDC, in both cotreatments and pretreatments, indicate that SA almost suppressed the clones induced by PDC. Nevertheless, no effects of arsenic were observed with respect to the pre- and cotreatments with EMS. Thus, SA does not modify the frequencies of mutant clones induced by EMS.",2002,"Mostapha Rizki, Elk Kossatz, Noel Xamena, Amadeu Creus, Ricardo Marcos, Mostapha Rizki, Elk Kossatz, Noel Xamena, Amadeu Creus, Ricardo Marcos"
Molecular and biochemical characterization of two P450 enzymes in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway of Drosophila melanogaster,12177427,10.1073/pnas.162375799,"Five different enzymatic activities, catalyzed by both microsomal and mitochondrial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), are strongly implicated in the biosynthesis of ecdysone (E) from cholesterol. However, none of these enzymes have been characterized completely. The present data show that the wild-type genes of two members of the Halloween family of embryonic lethals, disembodied (dib) and shadow (sad), code for mitochondrial cytochromes P450 that mediate the last two hydroxylation reactions in the ecdysteroidogenic pathway in Drosophila, namely the C22- and C2-hydroxylases. When sad (CYP315A1) is transfected into Drosophila S2 cells, the cells metabolize 2-deoxyecdysone (2dE) to E and the [3H]ketotriol (2,22-dideoxyecdysone) to 22-deoxyecdysone. In contrast, dib (CYP302A1) is responsible for the conversion of the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]2dE. When cells are transfected with both dib and sad, they metabolize the [3H]ketotriol to [3H]E in high yield. The expression of sad and dib is concentrated within the individual segments of the developing epidermis when there is a surge of ecdysteroid midway through embryogenesis. This result occurs before the ring gland has developed and suggests that the embryonic epidermis is a site of ecdysteroid biosynthesis. This pattern then diminishes, and, during late embryogenesis, expression of both genes is concentrated in the prothoracic gland cells of the developing ring gland. Expression of dib and sad continues to be localized in this endocrine compartment during larval development, being maximal in both the late second and third instar larvae, about the time of the premolt peaks in the ecdysteroid titer.",2002,"James T Warren, Anna Petryk, Guillermo Marques, Michael Jarcho, Jean-Philippe Parvy, Chantal Dauphin-Villemant, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert, James T Warren, Anna Petryk, Guillermo Marques, Michael Jarcho, Jean-Philippe Parvy, Chantal Dauphin-Villemant, Michael B O'Connor, Lawrence I Gilbert"
Cloning and functional expression of the first Drosophila melanogaster sulfakinin receptor DSK-R1,11846406,10.1006/bbrc.2002.6459,"Described in this report is a successful cloning and characterization of a functionally active Drosophila sulfakinin receptor designated DSK-R1. When expressed in mammalian cells, DSK-R1 was activated by a sulfated, Met(7-->Leu(7)-substituted analog of drosulfakinin-1, FDDY(SO(3)H)GHLRF-NH(2) ([Leu(7)]-DSK-1S). The interaction of [Leu(7)]-DSK-1S with DSK-R1 led to a dose-dependent intracellular calcium increase with an EC(50) in the low nanomolar range. The observed Ca(2+) signal predominantly resulted from activation of pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive signaling pathways pointing most likely to G(q/11) involvement in coupling to the activated receptor. The unsulfated [Leu(7)]-DSK-1 was ca. 3000-fold less potent than its sulfated counterpart which stresses the importance of the sulfate moiety for the biological activity of drosulfakinin. The DSK-R1 was specific for the insect sulfakinin since two related vertebrate sulfated peptides, human CCK-8 and gastrin-II, were found inactive when tested at concentrations up to 10(-5) M.

The dynamics of homologous chromosome pairing during male Drosophila meiosis,12225662,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01090-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Meiotic pairing is essential for the proper orientation of chromosomes at the metaphase plate and their subsequent disjunction during anaphase I. In male Drosophila melanogaster, meiosis occurs in the absence of recombination or a recognizable synaptonemal complex (SC). Due to limitations in available cytological techniques, the early stages of homologous chromosome pairing in male Drosophila have not been observed, and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Chromosome tagging with GFP-Lac repressor protein allowed us to track, for the first time, the behavior of meiotic chromosomes at high resolution, live, at all stages of male Drosophila meiosis. Homologous chromosomes pair throughout the euchromatic regions in spermatogonia and during the early phases of spermatocyte development. Extensive separation of homologs and sister chromatids along the chromosome arms occurs in mid-G2, several hours before the first meiotic division, and before the G2/M transition. Centromeres, on the other hand, show complex association patterns, with specific homolog pairing taking place in mid-G2. These changes in chromosome pairing parallel changes in large-scale chromosome organization.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that widespread interactions along the euchromatin are required for the initiation, but not the maintenance, of meiotic pairing of autosomes in male Drosophila. We propose that heterochromatic associations, or chromatid entanglement, may be responsible for the maintenance of homolog association during late G2. Our data also suggest that the formation of chromosome territories in the spermatocyte nucleus may play an active role in ensuring the specificity of meiotic pairing in late prophase by disrupting interactions between nonhomologous chromosomes.",2002,"Julio Vazquez, Andrew S Belmont, John W Sedat, Julio Vazquez, Andrew S Belmont, John W Sedat"
Trans-complementation of an endonuclease-defective tagged I element as a tool for the study of retrotransposition in Drosophila melanogaster,12207231,10.1007/s00438-002-0716-z,"I factors are non-LTR retrotransposons of Drosophila melanogaster that transpose at high frequency in the germline of females resulting from appropriate crosses, allowing in vivo studies of the retrotransposition process. Reverse transcription of a full-length RNA intermediate is thought to occur at the site of integration, using a 3' hydroxyl group generated by endonucleolytic cleavage of the genomic DNA to prime synthesis of the first cDNA strand. This target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) process is mediated by endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities encoded by the element. We have designed a molecularly tagged, endonuclease-defective I element that can be mobilised with high efficiency by constructs that express the product of the I factor ORF2 in trans. This indicates that the endonuclease activity required for retrotransposition of the I factor can be provided in trans. Using this system, we show that the endonuclease domain of the R1Bm retrotransposon from Bombyx mori cannot functionally replace that of the I factor.",2002,"S Robin, S Chambeyron, C Brun, A Bucheton, I Busseau, S Robin, S Chambeyron, C Brun, A Bucheton, I Busseau"
Regulation of P-element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster by hobo transgenes that contain KP elements,12019235,,"Fusions between the Drosophila hsp70 promoter and three different incomplete P elements, KP, SP, and BP1, were inserted into the Drosophila genome by means of hobo transformation vectors and the resulting transgenic stocks were tested for repression of P-element transposase activity. Only the H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed transposase activity, and the degree of repression was comparable to that of a naturally occurring KP element. The KP transgenes repressed transposase activity both with and without heat-shock treatments. Both the KP element and H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed the transposase activity encoded by the modified P element in the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene more effectively than that encoded by the complete P element in the H(hsp/CP)2 transgene even though the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene was the stronger transposase source. Repression of both transposase sources appeared to be due to a zygotic effect of the KP element or transgene. There was no evidence for repression by a strictly maternal effect; nor was there any evidence for enhancement of KP repression by the joint maternal transmission of H(hsp/KP) and H(hsp/CP) transgenes. These results are consistent with the idea that KP-mediated repression of P-element activity involves a KP-repressor polypeptide that is not maternally transmitted and that KP-mediated repression is not strengthened by the 66-kD repressor produced by complete P elements through alternate splicing of their RNA.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong"
A hobo transgene that encodes the P-element transposase in Drosophila melanogaster: autoregulation and cytotype control of transposase activity,12019234,,"Drosophila were genetically transformed with a hobo transgene that contains a terminally truncated but otherwise complete P element fused to the promoter from the Drosophila hsp70 gene. Insertions of this H(hsp/CP) transgene on either of the major autosomes produced the P transposase in both the male and female germlines, but not in the soma. Heat-shock treatments significantly increased transposase activity in the female germline; in the male germline, these treatments had little effect. The transposase activity of two insertions of the H(hsp/CP) transgene was not significantly greater than their separate activities, and one insertion of this transgene reduced the transposase activity of P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B, a stable P transgene, in the germline as well as in the soma. These observations suggest that, through alternate splicing, the H(hsp/CP) transgene produces a repressor that feeds back negatively to regulate transposase expression or function in both the somatic and germline tissues. The H(hsp/CP) transgenes are able to induce gonadal dysgenesis when the transposase they encode has P-element targets to attack. However, this ability and the ability to induce P-element excisions are repressed by the P cytotype, a chromosomal/cytoplasmic state that regulates P elements in the germline.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Jarad B Niemi"
Intranuclear virus-like particles of a Drosophila hybrid,12117278,,"Intranuclear virus-like particles (VLPs) have been observed in different cell lines and adult tissues of Drosophila.

The intranuclear VLPs were round or slightly elliptical with a diameter of 30 nm, and they were found mainly in highly organised clusters, forming large crystalline arrays, near the nucleolus and the polycene chromosomes. These particles were never observed in the cytoplasm of any mame's tissue. A few VLPs were also seen in the corresponding tissues of D. melanogaster, but they were never observed in any tissue of D. mauritiana.

Dietary modulation of Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour,20706579,10.1371/journal.pone.0012062,"Background:
      
    

    
      A complex relationship exists between diet and sleep but despite its impact on human health, this relationship remains uncharacterized and poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster is an important model for the study of metabolism and behaviour, however the effect of diet upon Drosophila sleep remains largely unaddressed.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      Using automated behavioural monitoring, a capillary feeding assay and pharmacological treatments, we examined the effect of dietary yeast and sucrose upon Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour for three consecutive days. We found that dietary yeast deconsolidated the sleep-wake behaviour of flies by promoting arousal from sleep in males and shortening periods of locomotor activity in females. We also demonstrate that arousal from nocturnal sleep exhibits a significant ultradian rhythmicity with a periodicity of 85 minutes. Increasing the dietary sucrose concentration from 5% to 35% had no effect on total sucrose ingestion per day nor any affect on arousal, however it did lengthen the time that males and females remained active. Higher dietary sucrose led to reduced total sleep by male but not female flies. Locomotor activity was reduced by feeding flies Metformin, a drug that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, however Metformin did not affect any aspects of sleep.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We conclude that arousal from sleep is under ultradian control and regulated in a sex-dependent manner by dietary yeast and that dietary sucrose regulates the length of time that flies sustain periods of wakefulness.

We did a thorough search using experimental and computational methods and found 18 Y-linked copies of this gene (named Mst77Y-1-Mst77Y-18). Ten Mst77Y genes encode defective proteins and the other eight are potentially functional. These eight genes produce approximately 20% of the functional Mst77F-like mRNA, and molecular evolutionary analysis shows that they evolved under purifying selection. Hence several Mst77Y genes have all the features of functional genes. Mst77Y genes are present only in D. melanogaster, and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the duplication is a recent event.

Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the evaluation of anti-aging compounds,20473034,10.4161/fly.4.3.11997,"Understanding the causes of aging is a complex problem due to the multiple factors that influence aging, which include genetics, environment, metabolism and reproduction, among others. These multiple factors create logistical difficulties in the evaluation of anti-aging agents. There is a need for good model systems to evaluate potential anti-aging compounds. The model systems used should represent the complexities of aging in humans, so that the findings may be extrapolated to human studies, but they should also present an opportunity to minimize the variables so that the experimental results can be accurately interpreted. In addition to positively affecting lifespan, the impact of the compound on the physiologic confounders of aging, including fecundity and the health span--the period of life where an organism is generally healthy and free from serious or chronic illness--of the model organism needs to be evaluated. Fecundity is considered a major confounder of aging in fruit flies. It is well established that female flies that are exposed to toxic substances typically reduce their dietary intake and their reproductive output and display an artifactual lifespan extension. As a result, drugs that achieve longevity benefits by reducing fecundity as a result of diminished food intake are probably not useful candidates for eventual treatment of aging in humans and should be eliminated during the screening process. Drosophila melanogaster provides a suitable model system for the screening of anti-aging compounds as D. melanogaster and humans have many conserved physiological and biological pathways. In this paper, I propose an algorithm to screen anti-aging compounds using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.",2010,"Mahtab Jafari, Mahtab Jafari"

Ecdysone signaling is required for proper organization and fluid secretion of stellate cells in the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,20209436,10.1387/ijdb.092910ng,"Drosophila development is a tightly regulated process involving metamorphosis of a relatively less mobile larva to a highly motile adult, triggered by secretion of 20-hydroxyecdysone. Under the influence of ecdysone, most of the larval tissues degenerate, while the imaginal cells differentiate and form adult specific structures. Although the larval Malpighian tubules do not seem to be affected by ecdysone during metamorphosis, we show that ecdysone signaling plays an important role in the early development and functioning of Malpighian tubules. Disruption of ecdysone receptor function, using targeted expression of dominant negative ecdysone receptor in stellate cells, results in disruption of organization of Malpighian tubules. The number of stellate cells is reduced in such Malpighian tubules. Further, they get clustered rather than distributed in their characteristic wild type pattern. We also demonstrate that expression of Drosophila integrin protein (DRIP), an aquaporin responsible for trans-cellular water transport, is also reduced in stellate cells when ecdysone signaling is disrupted. Our results show that of the three ecdysone receptor isoforms, only EcR-B2 rescues these phenotypes. A similar pattern of stellate cell clustering and reduced expression of DRIP is observed in ecd(1), a temperature sensitive mutant, under non-permissive conditions. These results suggest that ecdysone signaling is required for proper patterning and functioning of stellate cells and that EcR-B2 may be the primary isoform required for ecdysone signaling in stellate cells.",2010,"Naveen-Kumar Gautam, Madhu G Tapadia, Naveen-Kumar Gautam, Madhu G Tapadia"
Locomotor activity level monitoring using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System,21041391,10.1101/pdb.prot5518,"Adult behavioral assays have been used with great success in Drosophila melanogaster to identify circadian rhythm genes. In particular, the locomotor activity assay can identify altered behavior patterns over the course of several days in small populations, or even individual flies. Commercially available, highly efficient automated systems allow for continuous data collection from large numbers of individuals, and analytical tools make it possible to quickly analyze multiple aspects of circadian behavior from each experiment. These features make the locomotor activity assay useful for high-throughput analyses, leading to the rapid discovery and functional characterization of many Drosophila circadian rhythm genes. The locomotor assay described here can simultaneously assess both circadian and sleep behavior, and several methods can be used to analyze the data generated from such assays. This protocol details the use of the Drosophila Activity Monitoring (DAM) System from TriKinetics. Briefly, the system records activity from individual flies maintained in sealed tubes placed in activity monitors. An infrared beam directed through the midpoint of each tube measures an ""activity event"" each time a fly crosses the beam.

Binding site turnover produces pervasive quantitative changes in transcription factor binding between closely related Drosophila species,20351773,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000343,"Changes in gene expression play an important role in evolution, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory evolution are poorly understood. Here we compare genome-wide binding of the six transcription factors that initiate segmentation along the anterior-posterior axis in embryos of two closely related species: Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. Where we observe binding by a factor in one species, we almost always observe binding by that factor to the orthologous sequence in the other species. Levels of binding, however, vary considerably. The magnitude and direction of the interspecies differences in binding levels of all six factors are strongly correlated, suggesting a role for chromatin or other factor-independent forces in mediating the divergence of transcription factor binding. Nonetheless, factor-specific quantitative variation in binding is common, and we show that it is driven to a large extent by the gain and loss of cognate recognition sequences for the given factor. We find only a weak correlation between binding variation and regulatory function.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the potential biological effects and modes of action of PFOA in a range of physiologically and developmentally related phenotypes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The results clearly indicated that the toxic effects of PFOA at the organismal level were associated with the developmental status of the organism, with larvae being most sensitive to this chemical. Except for the decreased weight of both sexes and the reduced longevity of male adults, PFOA had a robust effect on larval development, as determined by reduced body volume, aberrant foraging behavior, molting arrest, and polyphasic lethality. Remarkably, nutrient supplementation of the diet efficiently rescued the lethal effect of high PFOA concentrations on larval development. This result indicated that PFOA probably competed with nutritional components, leading to a disruption of the metabolic pathways responsible for larval development.",2010,"Jianshe Wang, Yan Li, Yang Liu, Hongxia Zhang, Jiayin Dai, Jianshe Wang, Yan Li, Yang Liu, Hongxia Zhang, Jiayin Dai"
Synaptic connections of PDF-immunoreactive lateral neurons projecting to the dorsal protocerebrum of Drosophila melanogaster,19941354,10.1002/cne.22210,"Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster indicate that the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is an important output signal from a set of major clock neurons, s-LN(v)s (small ventral lateral neurons), which transmit the circadian phase to subsets of other clock neurons, DNs (dorsal neurons). Both s-LN(v)s and DNs have fiber projections to the dorsal protocerebrum of the brain, so that this area is a conspicuous locus for coupling between different subsets of clock neurons. To unravel the neural circuits underlying the fly's circadian rhythms, we examined the detailed subcellular morphology of the PDF-positive fibers of the s-LN(v)s in the dorsal protocerebrum, focusing on their synaptic connections, using preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. To examine the distribution of synapses, we also reconstructed the three-dimensional morphology of PDF-positive varicosities from fiber profiles in the dorsal protocerebrum. The varicosities contained large dense-core vesicles (DCVs), and also numerous small clear vesicles, forming divergent output synapses onto unlabeled neurites. The DCVs apparently dock at nonsynaptic sites, suggesting their nonsynaptic release. In addition, a 3D reconstruction revealed the presence of input synapses onto the PDF-positive fibers. These were detected less frequently than output sites. These observations suggest that the PDF-positive clock neurons receive neural inputs directly through synaptic connections in the dorsal protocerebrum, in addition to supplying dual outputs, either synaptic or via paracrine release of the DCV contents, to unidentified target neurons.",2010,"Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen, Kouji Yasuyama, Ian A Meinertzhagen"
Drosophila Ana2 is a conserved centriole duplication factor,20123993,10.1083/jcb.200910016,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, five proteins are required for centriole duplication: SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-5, SAS-6, and SAS-4. Functional orthologues of all but SAS-5 have been found in other species. In Drosophila melanogaster and humans, Sak/Plk4, DSas-6/hSas-6, and DSas-4/CPAP-orthologues of ZYG-1, SAS-6, and SAS-4, respectively-are required for centriole duplication. Strikingly, all three fly proteins can induce the de novo formation of centriole-like structures when overexpressed in unfertilized eggs. Here, we find that of eight candidate duplication factors identified in cultured fly cells, only two, Ana2 and Asterless (Asl), share this ability. Asl is now known to be essential for centriole duplication in flies, but no equivalent protein has been found in worms. We show that Ana2 is the likely functional orthologue of SAS-5 and that it is also related to the vertebrate STIL/SIL protein family that has been linked to microcephaly in humans. We propose that members of the SAS-5/Ana2/STIL family of proteins are key conserved components of the centriole duplication machinery.",2010,"Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Kathrin Brunk, Anna Franz, Jordan W Raff, Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Kathrin Brunk, Anna Franz, Jordan W Raff"
The gang of four gene regulates growth and patterning of the developing Drosophila eye,20473027,10.4161/fly.4.2.11890,"We report here the identification of a novel complementation group in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster named gang of four (gfr). Mutations in gfr disrupt patterns of cell differentiation in the eye and increase eye size through a proliferative mechanism that can be enhanced by a block in apoptosis. gfr mutant cells show several features of deregulated Ras/MAP kinase activity, including reduced expression of the Capicua growth suppressing transcription factor and synthetically lethality with alleles of the Jun N-terminal kinase phosphatase puckered. gfr alleles also upreguate Notch activity in the eye. Thus, gfr alleles appear to elicit growth and patterning phenotypes via effects on multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, the gfr alleles behave as gain-of-function lesions and overexpress the gene, bruno-3 (bru-3), which is located at the genomic region to which gfr lesions map. Genetic reduction of bru-3 suppresses phenotypes caused by gfr alleles, and like gfr alleles, overexpression of bru-3 depresses levels of Cic protein, indicating that overexpression of bru-3 is central to gfr mutant phenotypes.",2010,"Carolyn K Beam, Kenneth Moberg, Carolyn K Beam, Kenneth Moberg"
Macroglomeruli for fruit odors change blend preference in Drosophila,20972770,10.1007/s00114-010-0727-2,"The olfactory circuitry of Drosophila melanogaster is becoming increasingly clear. However, how olfactory processing translates into appropriate behavioral responses is still poorly understood. Using a sibling species approach, we tested how a perturbation in the olfactory circuitry affects odor preference. In a previous study, we found that the sibling species of D. melanogaster, the specialist D. sechellia, overrepresents a sensillum, ab3, the A neuron of which is sensitive to hexanoate esters, characteristic of the species' sole host, the Morinda citrifolia fruit. Concordantly, the corresponding glomerulus, DM2, is enlarged. In this study, we found that the ab3B neuron, the expansion of which was previously assumed to be pleiotropic and of no ecological significance, is in fact tuned to another morinda fruit volatile, 2-heptanone (HP). Axons of this neuron type arborize in a second enlarged glomerulus. In behavioral experiments we tested how this has affected the fly's odor preference. We demonstrate that D. sechellia has a reversed preference for the key ligands of these macroglomeruli, especially at high concentrations. Whereas D. melanogaster was repelled by high concentrations of these odors, D. sechellia was highly attracted. This was the case for odors presented singly, but more notably for blends thereof. Our study indicates that relatively simple changes, such as a shift in sensillar abundance, and concordant shifts in glomerular size, can distort the resulting olfactory code, and can lead to saltatory shifts in odor preference. D. sechellia has exploited this to align its olfactory preference with its ecological niche.",2010,"Irene Ibba, Anna Maria Angioy, Bill S Hansson, Teun Dekker, Irene Ibba, Anna Maria Angioy, Bill S Hansson, Teun Dekker"
A role for juvenile hormone in the prepupal development of Drosophila melanogaster,20181742,10.1242/dev.037218,"To elucidate the role of juvenile hormone (JH) in metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster, the corpora allata cells, which produce JH, were killed using the cell death gene grim. These allatectomized (CAX) larvae were smaller at pupariation and died at head eversion. They showed premature ecdysone receptor B1 (EcR-B1) in the photoreceptors and in the optic lobe, downregulation of proliferation in the optic lobe, and separation of R7 from R8 in the medulla during the prepupal period. All of these effects of allatectomy were reversed by feeding third instar larvae on a diet containing the JH mimic (JHM) pyriproxifen or by application of JH III or JHM at the onset of wandering. Eye and optic lobe development in the Methoprene-tolerant (Met)-null mutant mimicked that of CAX prepupae, but the mutant formed viable adults, which had marked abnormalities in the organization of their optic lobe neuropils. Feeding Met(27) larvae on the JHM diet did not rescue the premature EcR-B1 expression or the downregulation of proliferation but did partially rescue the premature separation of R7, suggesting that other pathways besides Met might be involved in mediating the response to JH. Selective expression of Met RNAi in the photoreceptors caused their premature expression of EcR-B1 and the separation of R7 and R8, but driving Met RNAi in lamina neurons led only to the precocious appearance of EcR-B1 in the lamina. Thus, the lack of JH and its receptor Met causes a heterochronic shift in the development of the visual system that is likely to result from some cells 'misinterpreting' the ecdysteroid peaks that drive metamorphosis.",2010,"Lynn M Riddiford, James W Truman, Christen K Mirth, Yu-Chi Shen, Lynn M Riddiford, James W Truman, Christen K Mirth, Yu-Chi Shen"

Vesicular ATPases are intracellular proton pumps that acidify autophagosomes and lysosomes. V0a1 is a key component of the v-ATPase that is only required in neurons in Drosophila melanogaster. We have recently shown that loss of V0a1 in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons leads to slow, adult-onset degeneration.1 Concurrently, Lee et al.2 reported that V0a1 fails to localize to lysosomal compartments in cells from Presenilin 1 knock-out cells. Together these two reports suggest that a neuronal V0a1-dependent degradation mechanism may be causally linked to Alzheimer pathology. Indeed, we now show that loss of V0a1 makes Drosophila neurons more susceptible to insult with human Alzheimer-related neurotoxic AÎ² and tau proteins. Furthermore, we discuss the potential significance of the discovery of the neuron-specific degradation mechanism in Drosophila for intracellular degradation defects in Alzheimer Disease.",2010,"W Ryan Williamson, P Robin Hiesinger, W Ryan Williamson, P Robin Hiesinger"
The chromosomal association/dissociation of the chromatin insulator protein Cp190 of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the BTB/POZ domain and two acidic regions,21194420,10.1186/1471-2121-11-101,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chromatin insulators or boundary elements are a class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome. They regulate gene transcription by interfering with promoter-enhancer communication. The Cp190 protein of Drosophila melanogaster is essential to the function of at least three-types of chromatin insulator complexes organized by Su(Hw), CTCF and BEAF32.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We mapped functional regions of Cp190 in vivo and identified three domains that are essential for the insulator function and for the viability of flies: the BTB/POZ domain, an aspartic acid-rich (D-rich) region and a C-terminal glutamic acid-rich (E-rich) region. Other domains including the centrosomal targeting domain and the zinc fingers are dispensable. The N-terminal CP190BTB-D fragment containing the BTB/POZ domain and the D-rich region is sufficient to mediate association with all three types of insulator complexes. The fragment however is not sufficient for insulator activity or viability. The Cp190 and CP190BTB-D are regulated differently in cells treated with heat-shock. The Cp190 dissociated from chromosomes during heat-shock, indicating that dissociation of Cp190 with chromosomes can be regulated. In contrast, the CP190BTB-D fragment didn't dissociate from chromosomes in the same heat-shocked condition, suggesting that the deleted C-terminal regions have a role in regulating the dissociation of Cp190 with chromosomes.

      The N-terminal fragment of Cp190 containing the BTB/POZ domain and the D-rich region mediates association of Cp190 with all three types of insulator complexes and that the E-rich region of Cp190 is required for dissociation of Cp190 from chromosomes during heat-shock. The heat-shock-induced dissociation is strong evidence indicating that dissociation of the essential insulator protein Cp190 from chromosomes is regulated.

Evidences for insulator activity of the 5'UTR of the Drosophila melanogaster LTR-retrotransposon ZAM,20364351,10.1007/s00438-010-0529-4,"Insulators or chromatin boundary are DNA elements that organize the genome into discrete regulatory domains by limiting the actions of enhancers and silencers through a ""positional-blocking mechanism"". The role of these sequences, both in modulation of the enhancers range of action (enhancer-promoter selectivity) and in the organization of the chromatin in functional domains, is emerging strongly in these last years. There is a great interest in identifying new insulators because deeper knowledge of these elements can help understand how cis-regulatory elements coordinate the expression of the target genes. However, while insulators are critical in gene regulation and genome functioning, only a few have been reported so far. Here, we describe a new insulator sequence that is located in the 5'UTR of the Drosophila retrotransposon ZAM. We have used an ""enhancer-blocking assay"" to test its effects on the activity of the enhancer in transiently transfected Drosophila S2R(+) cell line. Moreover, we show that the new insulator is able to affect significantly the enhancer-promoter interaction in the human cell line HEK293.

        Methods:
      
    

    
      MGC-803 and BGC-823 cells were infected with retroviral vectors containing the Dm-dNK gene expressing Dm-dNK in its active form. [(3)H]-labeled substrates were used for enzyme activity assays and cytotoxicities were evaluated in vitro by MTT assay and annexin-V-FITC labeled FACS methods.

Pseudomonas exotoxin kills Drosophila S2 cells via apoptosis,20659495,10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.07.007,"Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) is cytotoxic for eukaryotic cells because it enters cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, translocates to the cell cytosol and ADP-ribosylates elongation factor 2 (EF2). However, the interaction of this toxin with eukaryotic cells and the mechanism of PE-mediated cell death have not been extensively characterized. The feasibility of carrying out a genome-wide RNAi screen, makes Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a good model system to identify essential genes in PE-mediated cytotoxicity, provided a suitable multi-well assay is developed. Here, using the alamarBlue viability assay, we show that Drosophila S2 cells are sensitive to PE at picomolar concentrations and that toxin treatments provoke an increase in caspase activity. This prompted us to use RNAi to characterize the mechanism of cell death. Results indicated that PE-mediated death of S2 cells was dependent on the presence of diphthamide, the post translational modification of EF2, and on the presence of Drice, the terminal caspase of insect cells. RNAi to drice or chemical inhibition of caspase action by z-VAD-fmk protected cells from PE-mediated death. Protection from death by RNAi or z-VAD-fmk did not interfere with toxin delivery to the cytosol leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. Using a convenient alamarBlue assay, our data confirms the cytotoxicity of PE for S2 cells and establishes apoptosis as the mode of PE-mediated death.

Second, we tested the conservation of modifier gene function across species; genes identified in one invertebrate model were tested for function in the other invertebrate model.

The results suggest that, like in other eukaryotes studied, the control of meiotic crossover formation also in D. melanogaster is a two-phase process. The first phase seems to be temperature shock sensitive, independent of the mus309 gene and coincidental with the premeiotic DNA synthesis, thus most likely representing the formation of DSBs. The second phase seems to be temperature shock tolerant, dependent on the mus309 gene, occurring during the meiotic prophase and most likely representing the choice made by the oocyte between the different pathways of the DSB repair.

However, all insulator proteins, with the exception of CTCF, which has also been identified in vertebrates and worms, have been exclusively described in Drosophila melanogaster. In this work, we have performed database searches utilizing each D. melanogaster insulator protein as a query to find orthologs in other organisms, revealing that except for CTCF all known insulator proteins are restricted to insects. In particular, the boundary element-associated factor of 32 kDa (BEAF-32), which binds to thousands of sites throughout the genome, was only found in the Drosophila lineage. Accordingly, we also found a significant bias of BEAF-32 binding sites in relation to transcription start sites (TSSs) in D. melanogaster but not in Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, or Tribolium castaneum. These data suggest that DNA binding proteins such as BEAF-32 may have a dramatic impact in the genome of single evolutionary lineages.

In the sex chromosome, microsatellite distribution was not uniform and its density was higher than in autosomes. We identified homologous segments to the sequence flanking the microsatellite loci by browsing the genome sequence of Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila melanogaster. Their localization supports the conservation of Muller's chromosomal elements among Drosophila species and the existence of multiple intrachromosomal rearrangements within each evolutionary lineage.

      The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis has been shown to increase host resistance to viral infection in native Drosophila hosts and in the normally Wolbachia-free heterologous host Aedes aegypti when infected by Wolbachia from Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes albopictus. Wolbachia infection has not yet been demonstrated to increase viral resistance in a native Wolbachia-mosquito host system.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      In this study, we investigated Wolbachia-induced resistance to West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae) by measuring infection susceptibility in Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free D. melanogaster and Culex quinquefasciatus, a natural mosquito vector of WNV. Wolbachia infection of D. melanogaster induces strong resistance to WNV infection. Wolbachia-infected flies had a 500-fold higher ID50 for WNV and produced 100,000-fold lower virus titers compared to flies lacking Wolbachia. The resistance phenotype was transmitted as a maternal, cytoplasmic factor and was fully reverted in flies cured of Wolbachia. Wolbachia infection had much less effect on the susceptibility of D. melanogaster to Chikungunya (Togaviridae) and La Crosse (Bunyaviridae) viruses. Wolbachia also induces resistance to WNV infection in Cx. quinquefasciatus. While Wolbachia had no effect on the overall rate of peroral infection by WNV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes produced lower virus titers and had 2 to 3-fold lower rates of virus transmission compared to mosquitoes lacking Wolbachia.
    

    
  


        Conclusions/significance:
      
    

    
      This is the first demonstration that Wolbachia can increase resistance to arbovirus infection resulting in decreased virus transmission in a native Wolbachia-mosquito system. The results suggest that Wolbachia reduces vector competence in Cx. quinquefasciatus, and potentially in other Wolbachia-infected mosquito vectors.",2010,"Robert L Glaser, Mark A Meola"
In vivo analysis of Drosophila BLM helicase function during DNA double-strand gap repair,20225150,10.1007/978-1-60327-355-8_13,"The BLM helicase is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family and is mutated in the cancer-prone disorder Bloom syndrome. BLM plays a role in a number of cellular processes including DNA double-strand break repair, Holliday junction dissolution, and chromosome segregation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the BLM ortholog (DmBlm) is encoded by the mus309 gene. To study the role of DmBlm in double-strand break repair, we utilized a genetic assay in which a targeted DNA double-strand gap is created through excision of a P transposable element. By recovering and molecularly analyzing individual repair products from wild-type and mus309 male pre-meiotic germline cells, we demonstrated that the DmBlm helicase is involved in homologous recombination downstream of strand invasion. This assay can be adapted to test the roles of numerous DNA metabolic factors in DNA double-strand gap repair.",2010,"Mitch McVey, Mitch McVey"
Modulatory effect of Palicourea coriacea (Rubiaceae) against damage induced by doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,20568060,10.4238/vol9-2gmr801,"Palicourea coriacea, popularly known as ""douradinha"", is a medicinal plant from the Brazilian Cerrado region used in folk medicine to treat kidney and urethral stones and kidney inflammation. We evaluated the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and possible antigenotoxic activities of an aqueous extract of P. coriacea on somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, using the somatic mutation and recombination test. We used third-stage larvae of D. melanogaster from a standard cross and a high bioactivation cross and tested 10 different doses of P. coriacea aqueous extract (5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, 110, and 125 mg/mL). Doxorubicin (0.125 mg/mL) was used as a positive control and distilled water as a negative control. None of the doses was lethal to the larvae.There was no genotoxic effect at 5, 10, or 15 mg extract/mL. However, a significant decrease in the frequency of spots induced by doxorubicin was observed when administered with P. coriacea aqueous extract at these same doses. We conclude that P. coriacea aqueous extract is not cytotoxic or genotoxic at these doses, but it does protect against the genotoxic action of doxorubicin.",2010,"D C S Passos, H D Ferreira, I L F B Vieira, W B Nunes, L P FelÃ­cio, E M Silva, C R Vale, S R Duarte, E S Silva, S Carvalho, D C S Passos, H D Ferreira, I L F B Vieira, W B Nunes, L P FelÃ­cio, E M Silva, C R Vale, S R Duarte, E S Silva, S Carvalho"

A sequence motif enriched in regions bound by the Drosophila dosage compensation complex,20226017,10.1186/1471-2164-11-169,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation is mediated by the action of the dosage compensation complex (DCC). How the DCC recognizes the fly X chromosome is still poorly understood. Characteristic sequence signatures at all DCC binding sites have not hitherto been found.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we compare the known binding sites of the DCC with oligonucleotide profiles that measure the specificity of the sequences of the D. melanogaster X chromosome. We show that the X chromosome regions bound by the DCC are enriched for a particular type of short, repetitive sequences. Their distribution suggests that these sequences contribute to chromosome recognition, the generation of DCC binding sites and/or the local spreading of the complex. Comparative data indicate that the same sequences may be involved in dosage compensation in other Drosophila species.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These results offer an explanation for the wild-type binding of the DCC along the Drosophila X chromosome, contribute to delineate the forces leading to the establishment of dosage compensation and suggest new experimental approaches to understand the precise biochemical features of the dosage compensation system.",2010,"Miguel Gallach, Vicente Arnau, Rodrigo Aldecoa, Ignacio MarÃ­n, Miguel Gallach, Vicente Arnau, Rodrigo Aldecoa, Ignacio MarÃ­n"
Drosophila von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene function in epithelial tubule morphogenesis,20516215,10.1128/MCB.01578-09,"Mutations in the human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are the cause of VHL disease that displays multiple benign and malignant tumors. The VHL gene has been shown to regulate angiogenic potential and glycolic metabolism via its E3 ubiquitin ligase function against the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-alpha). However, many HIF-independent functions of VHL have been identified. Recent evidence also indicates that the canonical function cannot fully explain the VHL mutant cell phenotypes, although it is still unclear how many of these noncanonical functions relate to the pathophysiological processes because of a lack of tractable genetic systems. Here, we report the first genomic mutant phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster VHL (dVHL) in the epithelial tubule network, the trachea, and show that dVHL regulates branch migration and lumen formation via its endocytic function. The endocytic function regulates the surface level of the chemotactic signaling receptor Breathless and promotes clearing of the lumen matrix during maturation of the tracheal tubes. Importantly, the regulatory function in tubular morphogenesis is conserved in the mammalian system, as conditional knockout of Vhl in mouse kidney also resulted in similar cell motility and lumen phenotypes.",2010,"Anita Hsouna, Gouthami Nallamothu, Nurgun Kose, Maria Guinea, Vincent Dammai, Tien Hsu, Anita Hsouna, Gouthami Nallamothu, Nurgun Kose, Maria Guinea, Vincent Dammai, Tien Hsu"

Recombinant DNA technology was developed in the 1970s and Drosophila DNA was the first among multicellular organisms to be cloned. It provided a detailed characterization of genes in combination of classical cytogenetic data.

A clinally varying promoter polymorphism associated with adaptive variation in wing size in Drosophila,20074315,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04509.x,"Body size often shows adaptive clines in many ectotherms across altitude and latitude, but little is known about the genetic basis of these adaptive clines. Here we identify a polymorphism in the Dca (Drosophila cold acclimation) gene in Drosophila melanogaster that influences wing size, affects wing:thorax allometry and also controls a substantial proportion of the clinal wing-size variation. A polymorphism in the promoter region of Dca had two common alleles showing strong reciprocal clinal variation in frequency with latitude along the east coast of Australia. The Dca-237 allele increased towards the tropics where wing size is smaller. A within-population association study highlighted that an increase in the frequency of this allele decreased wing size but did not influence thorax size. A manipulated increase in the level of expression of Dca achieved through UAS-GAL4 was associated with a decrease in wing size but had no effect on thorax size. This was consistent with higher Dca expression levels in family lines with higher frequency of the Dca-237 allele. Genetic variation in the promoter region of the Dca gene appears to influence adaptive size variation in the eastern Australian cline of Drosophila melanogaster and accounts for more than 10% of the genetic variation in size within and between populations.",2010,"S W McKechnie, M J Blacket, S V Song, L Rako, X Carroll, T K Johnson, L T Jensen, S F Lee, C W Wee, A A Hoffmann, S W McKechnie, M J Blacket, S V Song, L Rako, X Carroll, T K Johnson, L T Jensen, S F Lee, C W Wee, A A Hoffmann"
Odorant receptor polymorphisms and natural variation in olfactory behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,20628035,10.1534/genetics.110.119446,"Animals perceive and discriminate among a vast array of sensory cues in their environment. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to individual variation in behavioral responses to these cues. Here, we asked to what extent sequence variants in six Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor (Or) genes are associated with variation in behavioral responses to benzaldehyde by sequencing alleles from a natural population. Sequence analyses showed signatures of deviations from neutrality for Or42b and Or85f, and linkage disequilibrium analyses showed a history of extensive recombination between polymorphic markers for all six Or genes. We identified polymorphisms in Or10a, Or43a, and Or67b that were significantly associated with variation in response to benzaldehyde. To verify these associations, we repeated the analyses with an independent set of behavioral measurements of responses to a structurally similar odorant, acetophenone. Association profiles for both odorants were similar with many polymorphisms and haplotypes associated with variation in responsiveness to both odorants. Some polymorphisms, however, were associated with one, but not the other odorant. We also observed a correspondence between behavioral response to benzaldehyde and differences in Or10a and Or43a expression. These results illustrate that sequence variants that arise during the evolution of odorant receptor genes can contribute to individual variation in olfactory behavior and give rise to subtle shifts in olfactory perception.",2010,"Stephanie M Rollmann, Ping Wang, Priya Date, Steven A West, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Stephanie M Rollmann, Ping Wang, Priya Date, Steven A West, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt"

Time-lapse, three-dimensional data recorded in living embryos revealed that congression of chromosomes (the process whereby chromosomes move to form the metaphase plate) at prometaphase occurs as a wave, starting at the top of the nucleus near the embryo surface and proceeding through the nucleus to the bottom. The time-lapse analysis was augmented by a high-resolution analysis of fixed embryos where it was possible to unambiguously trace the three-dimensional paths of individual chromosomes. In prophase, the centromeres were found to be clustered at the top of the nucleus while the telomeres were situated at the bottom of the nucleus or towards the embryo interior. This polarized centromere-telomere orientation, perpendicular to the embryo surface, was preserved during the process of prometaphase chromosome congression. Correspondingly, breakdown of the nuclear envelope started at the top of the nucleus with the mitotic spindle being formed at the positions of the partial breakdown of the nuclear envelope.

Drosophila melanogaster genes for U1 snRNA variants and their expression during development,2124674,10.1093/nar/18.23.6971,"We have cloned and characterized a complete set of seven U1-related sequences from Drosophila melanogaster. These sequences are located at the three cytogenetic loci 21D, 82E, and 95C. Three of these sequences have been previously studied: one U1 gene at 21D which encodes the prototype U1 sequence (U1a), one U1 gene at 82E which encodes a U1 variant with a single nucleotide substitution (U1b), and a pseudogene at 82E. The four previously uncharacterized genes are another U1b gene at 82E, two additional U1a genes at 95C, and a U1 gene at 95C which encodes a new variant (U1c) with a distinct single nucleotide change relative to U1a. Three blocks of 5' flanking sequence similarity are common to all six full length genes. Using specific primer extension assays, we have observed that the U1b RNA is expressed in Drosophila Kc cells and is associated with snRNP proteins, suggesting that the U1b-containing snRNP particles are able to participate in the process of pre-mRNA splicing. We have also examined the expression throughout Drosophila development of the two U1 variants relative to the prototype sequence.

Sequence and expression of the Drosophila phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA,2121612,10.1016/0378-1119(90)90227-i,"We report the cloning, nucleotide (nt) sequence and expression of the cDNA (pah) encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) of Drosophila melanogaster. The strong hybridization signals observed in genomic blots when D. melanogaster DNA was probed with 32P-labeled human pah cDNA, indicated the existence of a high degree of sequence similarity between the pah genes of both species. The length of the pah genomic fragment is about 30 to 40 kb. The cDNA contains 84 bp of the 5'-untranslated region, 1359 bp of the protein-coding region and 87 bp of the 3' region, with only one polyadenylation signal. The isolated cDNA is probably full-length, since the size of the D. melanogaster PAH mRNA is 1.5 kb. At the nt level, the similarity of the D. melanogaster cDNA with human and rat pah cDNAs is 57.9% and 58.1%, respectively. The highest similarities are restricted to the nt sequence coding for the presumed hydroxylation domain. There is no nt sequence similarity between the first three exons of the human pah gene and an equivalent fraction of the D. melanogaster pah gene. At the amino acid (aa) level, the similarity in the presumed hydroxylation domain is 88.5%, in which two motifs of the structure AGLLSSXXXL are found, where X represents any aa. It was interesting to notice the conservation of aa 408, 311 and 280, where mutations are associated with phenylketonuria in humans.

The majority of heterozygous combinations demonstrated dominance or partial dominance for the higher insertion tendency over low insertion, while a few combinations produced results to the contrary. These could be due to a more complex genetic basis of insertion behavior than a simple dominant/recessive relationship or else to the cytoplasmic/maternal-chromosome interactions. Examination of the effects of each chromosome revealed the greatest contributions to insertion tendency from the second and third chromosomes, with a significant effect of interaction or nonadditivity of the insertion genes in these two chromosomes in the genotypes tested.

The rates of insertion and excision of the copia and two copia-like elements, 412 and 17.6, are very low: Insertions occurred at up to 10(-3) per second chromosome per generation (17.6) and excision occurred at about 10(-5) per site per generation (copia and 412).

The presence of mutant allele/s at either locus in the homo- or heterozygous condition prevented induction of the 93D puff by heat shock. Elimination of the mutant allele at the ebony or black locus by recombination or by reversion of a P element insertion mutant allele of ebony restored the heat shock inducibility of the 93D puff. In vivo or in vitro administration of excess beta-alanine to salivary glands of wild-type larvae also resulted in the 93D site being refractory to heat shock induction. In agreement with earlier results, non-induction of the 93D puff during heat shock due to the beta-alanine effect was accompanied by unequal puffing of the 87A and 87C loci.

Molecular evolution in the Drosophila yakuba period locus,1702156,10.1007/BF02106054,"Two nuclear genes from Drosophila yakuba were cloned, the orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster period (per) clock gene and the orthologue of an unnamed D. melanogaster gene adjacent to per, which encodes a 0.9-kb RNA transcript. The DNA and presumed protein sequences of both genes are presented and compared with their orthologues in D. melanogaster. Consistent with the per orthologues described in other Drosophila species, some parts of the per gene have accumulated nonsynonymous substitutions at a much higher rate than others. This contrasts markedly with the evenly distributed amino acid replacements observed in the protein encoded by the adjacent gene. The level of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between D. yakuba and D. melanogaster per were compared in small subsections across the gene. The results suggest that the divergence observed in the less well-conserved regions of the per protein is principally due to reduced selective constraint, although the limitations of the method used prevent positive selection acting upon a small proportion of sites being ruled out. The level of silent substitution observed in both of these nuclear genes is very similar to the level of silent substitution previously reported between D. melanogaster and D. yakuba mitochondrial genes, confirming several indirect studies, which have suggested that, in contrast to the case in mammals, silent sites are evolving at similar rates in mitochondrial and nuclear genes of Drosophila.",1990,"J R Thackeray, C P Kyriacou"

The resulting genetic maps demonstrate that some spacer variants are widely dispersed, while others are limited in their distribution. Moreover, exchange among ribosomal DNA (DNA encoding rRNA) arrays was often unequal, leading to a prediction of little or no relationship between physical location in an array and relatedness of gene family members.

The chain length distribution is very similar and is predominantly pentaglutamate. Half-life estimates of the hydrolytic degradation to the monoglutamate showed larva less than pupa less than adult. This raises the possibility that polyglutamate hydrolase may have a role in regulating the total intracellular reduced folate content of the different developmental stages.",1990,"E J Duke, D G Priest, E J Duke, D G Priest"
"[Cloning and molecular analysis of retrotransposon mdg4 from two Drosophila melanogaster strains, differing in genetic instability]",1964922,,"The copies of mobile element mdg4 (gypsy) were cloned from two different D. melanogaster strains. The first strain (stable) is characterized by small number of mdg4 copies and their constant localization in chromosomes. The second strain (unstable), which was originated from the first one, is characterized by increased number of mdg4 copies and higher frequency of its transpositions. The two copies of mdg4, cloned from stable and unstable strains differ in their structure and represent two different types of mdg4. Southern blot-analysis of structural organization of mdg4 in these two strains showed, that in the stable strain there are mdg4 copies of one type, and in the unstable strain there are both, but only the mdg4 copies of another type were amplified. In was shown by transient-expression experiments, that in spite of the structural differences both types of mdg4 were able to be transcribed. Nevertheless, in flies of stable strain the mdg4 transcripts were not detected.",1990,"N V Liubomirskaia, I R Arkhipova, Iu V Il'in, A I Kim, N V Liubomirskaia, I R Arkhipova, Iu V Il'in, A I Kim"

Two reinforcement schedules were applied, constant vs. partial. Partial reinforcement increased the number of trials needed to reach the learning criterion to the same extent in all age groups. Young flies needed fewer trials to reach the criterion than both middle-aged and old flies, which did not differ from each other. Extinction was delayed in the partial reinforcement groups by the same amount in all age groups. The slowest rate of extinction was observed in the old group and the fastest for the middle-aged flies.

Restriction-map variation at the zeste-tko region in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,2566105,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040538,"Restriction-map variation in 64 X chromosome lines extracted from three different natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated with seven six-nucleotide-recognizing enzymes for a 20-kb region including the zeste and tko genes. Ten restriction-site and four length polymorphisms (two insertions and two deletions) were detected. Contrary to the predicted lower level of variation for genes on the X chromosome, the level of variation attributable to nucleotide substitution (estimated heterozygosity/nucleotide = 0.004) was similar to that previously reported for autosomal loci. The amount of insertion/deletion variation in the studied region was within the range observed in autosomal regions and thus not explainable by a simple selection model against the effects of insertional mutations.

Monoclonal antibody probes discriminate early and late mutant defects in development of the Drosophila retina,2511049,10.1016/0012-1606(89)90267-4,"Many mutations in Drosophila melanogaster affect the morphology of the adult compound eye. However, the times at which the phenotypes first become manifest in development are, in most cases, unknown; they can occur at any of a series of stages. Among mutants in which eyes appear externally similar, the developmental stage of onset of each defect may be quite different. Pattern formation in the compound eye begins during the late third larval instar in the eye imaginal disc, when a wave of morphogenesis crosses the disc from posterior to anterior. As this wave crosses the disc, there appears in its wake an array of photoreceptor neuron clusters and accessory cells that will comprise the adult ommatidia. Eye discs from 20 abnormal-eye mutants were analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that highlight various aspects of the developing array, to observe the stage at which each anomaly becomes evident. Some mutations apparently affect precursor cells, others the setting up of the pattern, others maintenance of the pattern, and still others later morphogenetic events.",1989,"P J Renfranz, S Benzer, P J Renfranz, S Benzer"
A TEST OF THE ROLE OF EPISTASIS IN DIVERGENCE UNDER UNIFORM SELECTION,28564195,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb05175.x,"Five populations of Drosophila melanogaster have previously been shown to be replicably different in their responses to artificial selection for knockdown resistance to ethanol fumes (Cohan and Hoffmann, 1986). The present study tests whether this divergence could be attributed to the epistatic mechanism assumed by Wright's shifting-balance model of evolution, in which alleles favored in the genetic background of one population are not favored in that of another. If this were the mechanism of divergence, crosses between selected lines from different populations would be expected to yield an epistatic loss of the selected phenotype. However, all such crosses showed a good fit to an additive model with dominance. Divergence by an epistatic mechanism may also be associated with epistatic variance within populations, but no evidence for such epistasis was found. The populations therefore appear to have responded in different ways to selection not because of epistasis but because knockdown-resistance alleles that were common in some populations were absent (or at least less common) in others.",1989,"Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley, Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley"

Southern blot analysis and restriction endonuclease mapping of the cloned region indicate that it contains an Amy gene duplication within an inverted repeat sequence as is characteristic of the genomic arrangement for this species. Spacing between the cloned gene copies is similar to that commonly found in other strains. Evidence is presented for the presence of an inversion 4 to 9 kb in length within the cloned Amy region of the null strain. We postulate a causal relationship between the presence of the inversion and the failure of individuals from the null strain to express amylase. A model is proposed that suggests the inversion may have arisen through intramolecular (or sister-strand) recombination mediated by homologous pairing of the inverted repeat sequences at the Amy locus.",1989,"P E Schwartz, W W Doane, P E Schwartz, W W Doane"

The immunofluorescence over puffs, albeit lower than that over bands and interbands, indicates that chromatin decondensation can occur without complete loss of H1 in these structures.

The segmentation gene KrÃ¼ppel of Drosophila melanogaster has homeotic properties,2565277,10.1101/gad.3.1.114,"In Drosophila hindgut, Malpighian tubules and posterior midgut develop from the most posterior region of the blastoderm. One of the genes that influences the differentiation of the Malpighian tubules is KrÃ¼ppel (Kr), a segmentation gene of the gap class. Kr homozygous embryos lack thoracic and abdominal segments and, depending on the allele, develop nearly normal Malpighian tubules or do not differentiate them at all. In the wild type, injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into cells of the early gastrula at various posterior positions results in labeling of hindgut (93%), Malpighian tubules (46%), and posterior midgut (20%). Malpighian tubules were labeled only in combination with hindgut. In Kr1 homozygous embryos that lack Malpighian tubules, the label was restricted to hindgut (84%) and posterior midgut (24%). Because we could not find significant cell death in the posterior region of Kr1 embryos, we counted the cell nuclei in the hindguts of wild-type and mutant embryos. The results show that the hindgut in Kr1 embryos contains those cells that would differentiate into Malpighian tubules in wild type. Therefore, we conclude that the KrÃ¼ppel gene exhibits a homeotic function in addition to its role as a segmentation gene and is involved in separating hindgut and Malpighian tubule cells and in the elongation process as well.",1989,"R Harbecke, W Janning, R Harbecke, W Janning"
"Distribution patterns of HP1, a heterochromatin-associated nonhistone chromosomal protein of Drosophila",2515059,,"We have previously reported the identification of a nonhistone chromosomal protein (nhcp-19; now called HP1) preferentially associated with the heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster. A detailed study of the HP1 distribution pattern on polytene chromosomes by immunofluorescent staining, using monoclonal antibody C1A9, has been carried out. The results indicate that this protein is found within the centric beta-heterochromatin, in cytological regions 31, 41 and 80, and throughout polytene chromosome 4. Staining of telomeres is frequently observed, those of chromosome arms 2R and 3R and the X chromosome being the most conspicuous. Analysis of a fourth chromosome insertional translocation T(3;4)f/In(3L)P confirms an autonomous interaction with chromosome 4 material. Similarly, the beta-heterochromatin distal to light on chromosome arm 2L, moved to position 97D2 on chromosome arm 3R in the rearrangement ltx13, is prominently stained using the C1A9 antibody. Staining of intact salivary glands indicates that this rearranged segment of beta-heterochromatin is not associated with the polytene chromocenter, but provides an independent structural reference point. HP1 is not observed in the nuclei of the early syncytial embryo, but becomes concentrated in the nuclei at the syncytial blastoderm stage (ca. nuclear division cycle 10). This suggests that heterochromatin formation occurs at approximately the same stage at which nuclei first become transcriptionally competent. Thus, the C1A9 antibody may serve as a useful marker for both structural and functional studies of the Drosophila nucleus.",1989,"T C James, J C Eissenberg, C Craig, V Dietrich, A Hobson, S C Elgin, T C James, J C Eissenberg, C Craig, V Dietrich, A Hobson, S C Elgin"

The compound significantly increased the frequency of mosaic spots in mwh/flr3 wings, but revealed only a slight effect in mwh/TM2 wings.

Distribution and conservation of the foldback transposable element in Drosophila,2538638,10.1007/BF02102479,Foldback elements are a family of transposable elements described in Drosophila melanogaster. The members of this dispersed repetitive family have terminal inverted repeats that sometimes flank a central region. The inverted repeats of all the family members are homologous. The study of the distribution and conservation of the foldback elements in different Drosophila species shows that this distribution is different from that of the hybrid dysgenesis systems (PM and IR). Sequences homologous to foldback elements were observed by Southern blots and in situ hybridization in all species of the melanogaster subgroup and in some species of the montium and takahashii subgroups. The element was probably already present before the radiation of these subgroups. No evidence of horizontal transmission of the foldback element could be observed.,1989,"J Silber, C Bazin, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, M Volovitch, J Silber, C Bazin, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, M Volovitch"

Amino acid polymorphisms for esterase-6 in Drosophila melanogaster,2493155,10.1073/pnas.86.4.1426,"High-resolution electrophoresis has revealed 10 allozymes of esterase-6 (EC 3.1.1.1) in Drosophila melanogaster. The sequences of 13 isolates of the Est6 gene covering all 10 allozymes were obtained and 52 nucleotide differences were found. Sixteen of these cause amino acid replacements, of which three result in charge differences whose size and direction are consistent with the electrophoretic mobilities of the allozymes in which they occur. The smeared electrophoretic phenotype of one allozyme can be explained by the loss of a cysteine residue involved in a disulfide bridge. Several minor mobility variants within the major F and S electrophoretic phenotypes differ by amino acid substitutions that are generally conservative for charge but not for some other properties (size, polarity, or hydrophobicity). Four amino acid differences are found among different isolates of the same allozymes and, overall, 12 amino acid haplotypes occur among the 13 isolates sequenced. Nevertheless, the most common variants within F and S are distinguished by only two amino acids (Asn/Asp at 237 and Thr/Ala at 247), and these are the most likely targets for the selection underlying complementary latitudinal clines in F and S frequencies.",1989,"P H Cooke, J G Oakeshott, P H Cooke, J G Oakeshott"
Does postzygotic isolation result from improper dosage compensation?,2503427,,"The X chromosome invariably has the largest effect on postzygotic isolation between animal species. One explanation of this pattern is that inviability and sterility result from a breakdown in the dosage compensation of X-linked genes in hybrids. In Drosophila, such breakdown could result from divergence of the genes used to assess the X/autosomal (X/A) ratio, and thus the sex, of an individual. I test this hypothesis by introducing mutant alleles of the Sex-lethal locus into Drosophila melanogaster-Drosophila simulans hybrids. These mutants ""ignore"" any perceived anomalous X/A ratio and thus can be used to ensure proper dosage compensation in hybrids. These mutants do not rescue hybrid viability or fertility, implying that postzygotic isolation in this hybridization does not result from a disruption of dosage compensation caused by divergence of the X/A counting system.",1989,"H A Orr, H A Orr"

The D. virilis and D. pseudoobscura UO transgenes were expressed in the third-instar larva and adult Malpighian tubules, which is the D. melanogaster temporal pattern of UO gene expression. These observations indicate that differences in the temporal patterns of regulation of UO genes among these three Drosophila species are not likely to be due to evolutionary changes in the sequence or complement of UO cis-acting regulatory elements. The species differences in UO regulation are probably the result of changes in one or more trans-acting factors required for UO gene expression in the third-instar larval and adult stages.",1991,"L L Wallrath, T B Friedman, L L Wallrath, T B Friedman"

To improve the initial phases real space averaging, including phase extension from 4.0 to 2.5 A, has been applied. Refinement of the atomic positions by molecular dynamics resulted in a crystallographic R-factor of 0.214. The tertiary structure resembles in most parts that of the vertebrate aldolase from rabbit muscle.

Environmental stresses and mobilization of transposable elements in inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster,1851539,10.1016/0027-5107(91)90087-5,"Drastic changes in insertion patterns of the mobile elements copia and mdg-1 (a copia-like element) were checked in highly inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to various stresses. Flies were treated by factors known for their ability to increase mutation rates of classical genes, and for their action on transcription or transposition of mobile elements: heat shocks at 37 degrees C, dichlorvos, hydrogen peroxide and ecdysterone. The insertion patterns were analyzed in progenies of the treated flies, either on larvae by in situ hybridization of giant salivary gland chromosomes, or on adult flies by Southern blotting interpreted by densitometric analysis. The techniques used made it possible to detect only changes with frequencies of more than 10% of the insertion sites. We show that the copia and mdg-1 elements cannot be radically mobilized in our inbred lines under the stressful conditions used. This absence of 'explosion' of mobilization of transposable elements after the action of external factors suggests that the genomes of our highly inbred lines are relatively protected against environmental stresses.",1991,"C Arnault, A Heizmann, C Loevenbruck, C BiÃ©mont, C Arnault, A Heizmann, C Loevenbruck, C BiÃ©mont"

The distal region is characterized by a stage- and tissue-specific DNase I hypersensitive site. A stage- and tissue-specific factor, GEBF-I, binds in this region and is missing in 2B5 mutant larvae which lack Sgs-3 transcripts. This binding involves the simultaneous interaction with two distinct DNA sequences which induces conformational changes in the protein.

The genotoxicities of N-nitrosamines in Drosophila melanogaster in vivo: the correlation of mutagenicity in the wing spot test with the DNA damages detected by the DNA-repair test,1901957,10.1016/0165-1161(91)90012-w,"The genotoxicities of a series of N-nitrosamines were assayed in the wing spot test and a new short-term test of Drosophila melanogaster. In the spot test, larval flies trans-heterozygous for the somatic cell markers mwh and flr3 were fed the test reagents and the wing hairs in adults were inspected for clones expressing the phenotypes of the markers. In the other test, larval stock consisting of meiotic recombination-deficient (Rec-) double mutant mei-9a and mei-41D5 males and repair-proficient Rec+ females were grown on feed containing the reagents and the DNA damages were detected with the preferential killing of the Rec- larvae as an endpoint. The carcinogenic nitrosamines tested, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine (NDBA), N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR), N-nitro-sopiperidine (NPIP) and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), all showed clearly positive activities in both tests. The activities in the wing spot test were ranked in a sequence of NDMA much greater than NMOR greater than NPIP greater than NDEA greater than NPYR greater than NDBA. A similar ranking was obtained in the repair assay. The genotoxicity of N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), carcinogenicity studies of which are inconclusive, was marginal in the spot test. The non-carcinogenic N-nitrosoproline (NPRO) and the non-mutagenic N-nitrosothioproline (NTPRO) were negative in the spot test. NDPhA and NPRO were negative in the repair test as well. The DNA-repair test is thus a convenient technique for estimating the mutagenicity of compounds because of its simplicity compared with the wing spot test.

Lack of polymorphism on the Drosophila fourth chromosome resulting from selection,1686006,,"Evolutionary processes can be inferred from comparisons of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence. We sequenced a 1.1-kb fragment of the cubitus interruptus Dominant (ciD) locus located on the nonrecombining fourth chromosome for ten natural lines of Drosophila melanogaster and nine of Drosophila simulans. We found no polymorphism within D. melanogaster and a single polymorphism within D. simulans; divergence between the species was about 5%. Comparison with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene and its two flanking regions in D. melanogaster, for which comparable data are available, revealed a statistically significant departure from neutrality in all three tests. This lack of polymorphism in the ciD locus may reflect recent positive selective sweeps on the fourth chromosome with extreme hitchhiking generated by the lack of recombination. By simulation, we estimate there to be a 50% chance that the selective sweeps occurred within the past 30,000 years in D. melanogaster and 75,000 in D. simulans.",1991,"A J Berry, J W Ajioka, M Kreitman"

Genetic differentiation of Drosophila melanogaster populations as assessed by two-dimensional electrophoresis,1747099,10.1007/BF00554145,"Seven populations of Drosophila melanogaster, representing a worldwide distribution, were compared using two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis. A total of 611 protein spots was scored, which probably represent a sample of over 500 loci that were surveyed. Of the protein spots scored, 521 spots were found to be invariant, but another 90 spots were found to be variable among the populations. Of these variable protein spots, 12 were found to be present in only one population. All the populations, except one, had at least one protein spot restricted to itself. However, the Japanese population had by far the most, with five protein spots restricted to this one population, which has been observed in previous studies of private alleles in oriental populations. The mean genetic similarity (F) found among the seven populations was 0.965, with a range of between 0.956 and 0.977. This is similar to previous reports of lower variation found in population genetic surveys using two-dimensional electrophoresis. It was found that the historical relationships among these populations was somewhat congruent with the geographic distribution of the populations, but as in previous studies, it was not exactly coincident.",1991,"G S Spicer, J E Fleming, G S Spicer, J E Fleming"
Splicing of retrotransposon insertions from transcripts of the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion gene in a revertant,1664404,,"A mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster vermilion (v) gene known as v1 is caused by the insertion of a 412 retrotransposon into the 5' untranslated region of the first exon. Mutants carrying this insertion accumulate a low level of mRNA from which most of the transposon sequences have been eliminated by splicing at cryptic sites within transposon sequences. Here, we demonstrate that a revertant of the v1 allele called v+37 is caused by the insertion of a second retrotransposon, the B104/roo element, into a site near one end of the 412 element. The revertant strain accumulates a higher level of mRNA from which most of both transposons have been removed by splicing at new donor sites introduced by the B104/roo insertion and the same acceptor site within 412. Mutations at suppressor of sable [su(s)], which increase the accumulation of v1 transcripts, slightly elevate the level of v+37 RNA. In addition, we show that the first v intron downstream of the 412 insertion is not efficiently removed in the v1 mutant, and suppressor and reversion mutations increase the proportion of transcripts that are properly spliced at that downstream intron. Thus, it appears that both the suppressor and reversion mutations exert an effect at the level of pre-mRNA splicing.",1991,"A M Pret, L L Searles, A M Pret, L L Searles"
Tandemly repeating peptide motifs and their secondary structure in Ceratitis capitata eggshell proteins Ccs36 and Ccs38,1801905,10.1016/0141-8130(91)90032-p,"Evidence from amino acid composition, Fourier transform analysis of primary structure and secondary structure prediction suggests a tripartite structure for Ceratitis capitata eggshell proteins Ccs36 and Ccs38, which consists of a central domain and two flanking 'arms'. The proteins, apparently, contain tandemly repeating peptide motifs specific for each domain of the tripartite structure. The central domain of both proteins, which exhibits extensive sequence homology with the corresponding domains of Drosophila melanogaster proteins s36 and s38, is formed by tandem repeats of an octapeptide-X-X-X-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z- (where X = large hydrophobic residue and Z = beta-turn former residue) and its variants. It is predicted to adopt a compact, most probably twisted, antiparallel beta-pleated sheet structure of beta-sheet strands regularly alternating with beta-turns or loops. The central domains of Ccs36 and Ccs38 share structural similarities, but they are recognizably different. The 'arms' of the proteins presumably serving for protein and species-specific functions differ substantially from those of Drosophila melanogaster. In Ccs36, the C-terminal 'arm' is formed by, almost precise, tandem repeats of an octapeptide-Y-X-A-A-P-A-A-S- (X = G or S), whereas the N-terminal 'arm' contains repeats of the octapeptide -Z-Z-Z-A-X-A-A-Z- (X = Q, N or E and Z a beta-turn former).

Using various mutation selection systems as well as lines of different origin and two kinds of ionizing radiation--gamma-rays and neutrons--the mutagenesis in the region of interest is characterized at the cytogenetic level. 85 gamma-induced mutations affecting viability were isolated in the 44F 2-4; 45C6-7 interval, 27% of mutations being chromosomal aberrations. 15 radiation-induced aberrations were obtained by selecting mutations at the white gene inserted into the 45D region by P-mediated transformation. The 44F-45D region is characterized by relatively low frequency of deficiency formation and by significant predomination of heterochromatic aberrations in the spectrum of rearrangements. In these regions, the existence of hot spots for heterochromatic aberrations was discovered. As low deletion frequency is not connected with the presence of haplolethal and haplosterile loci in the region studied, the unusual character of radiation mutagenesis reflects possibly the peculiarities in sequence organization of the chromosomal region mentioned or the packaging in the sperm nuclei.",1991,"A Iu Konev, E R Varentsova, S V Sarantseva, Iu M Khromykh, A Iu Konev, E R Varentsova, S V Sarantseva, Iu M Khromykh"
Mutational specificity of ethyl methanesulfonate in excision-repair-proficient and -deficient strains of Drosophila melanogaster,1921971,10.1007/BF00272158,"The vermilion gene was used as a target to determine the mutational specificity of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster. To study the impact of DNA repair on the type of mutations induced, both excision-repair-proficient (exr+) and excision-repair-deficient (exr-) strains were used for the isolation of mutant flies. In all, 28 mutants from the exr+ strain and 24 from the exr- strain, were characterized by sequence analysis. In two mutants obtained from the exr+ strain, small deletions were observed. All other mutations were caused by single base-pair changes. In two mutants double base-pair substitutions had occurred. Of the mutations induced in the exr+ strain, 22 (76%) were GC----AT transitions, 3 (10%) AT----TA transversions, 2 (6%) GC----TA transversions and 2 (6%) were deletions. As in other systems, the mutation spectrum of EMS in Drosophila is dominated by GC----AT transitions. Of the mutations in an exr- background, 12 (48%) were GC----TA transitions, 7 (28%) AT----TA transversions, 5 (20%) GC----TA transversions and 1 (4%) was a AT----GC transition.

"Response to heat shock of gene 1, a Drosophila melanogaster small heat shock gene, is developmentally regulated",1903835,10.1007/BF00260651,"The expression of gene 1, a member of the small heat shock gene family from the Drosophila melanogaster chromosomal locus 67B was studied. In contrast to the other heat shock genes, the response of gene 1 to stress was modulated during development. In the absence of stress, gene 1 was expressed at the beginning of pupation, and at a very low level in adult males. Expression of gene 1 was substantially increased by heat shock in pupae, but was one to two orders of magnitude lower in adults or in embryos. Under the same conditions, hsp70 or hsp26 were induced to similar levels in all stages. This developmental effect could be mimicked in cultured Drosophila cells: expression of gene 1 was stimulated by heat shock in the presence, but not in the absence, of the moulting hormone ecdysterone, while the level of expression of hsp26 and hsp70 in response to heat shock was independent of the presence of the hormone. Thus, the presence and activity of the heat shock transcription factor are not sufficient for the maximal response of gene 1 to stress. These results suggest that the heat shock activator protein requires additional factors, which are developmentally regulated, to activate transcription of gene 1. Furthermore, S1 nuclease mapping analysis revealed several gene 1 mRNA species, which are generated by the use of alternative polyadenylation sites and by the use of differentially regulated transcriptional initiation sites.",1991,"J Vazquez, J Vazquez"

Using a cDNA Cu,Zn SOD probe from a wild type D. melanogaster (F allele) we isolated an EcoRI Cu,Zn SOD clone from an EMBL3 genomic library of the SODCA1 strain, subcloned it, restriction-mapped and partially sequenced it. The 2.5 kb clone consists of a wild-type 1.84 kb EcoRI fragment containing the Cu,Zn SOD gene previously isolated in our laboratory, with an insertion of 0.68 kb derived (by an internal deletion) from an autonomous, 2.9 kb P element. The insertion starts 21 bp upstream from the coding sequence and causes an 8 bp target site duplication characteristic of P elements. A point mutation in the second exon results in a replacement of Asn by Lys at position 96, confirming that the mature protein encoded by the SOCCA1 is the same one encoded by the S allele, commonly found in natural populations. The diminished expression of SODCA1 allele is most possibly due to a reduction of the rate of transcription attributable to the insertion of the P element.",1991,"J Kwiatowski, D Skarecky, R Tyler, M Pascual, F J Ayala, J Kwiatowski, D Skarecky, R Tyler, M Pascual, F J Ayala"

The library was screened with a small set of unique-sequence test probes, and clones containing the sequences have been recovered. In situ hybridization with salivary gland chromosomes indicates that the clones originate from the site of the probe sequences in the genome, and filter hybridization of restriction digests suggests that the clones are not rearranged in comparison with the genomic sequences. Approximately 1.7% of the clones contain sequences that hybridize with ribosomal DNA. A small subset of these clones was tested for stability by examination of restriction fragments produced after repeated subculturing, and no evidence for instability was found.

Using Antp P1 and P2 promoter fragments linked to the E. coli lacZ reporter gene we show different expression patterns of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in transformed Pc+ and Pc- embryos. In addition we are able to visualize by immunocytochemical techniques on polytene chromosomes the direct binding of the Pc protein to the transposed cis-regulatory promoter fragments.

This in vivo assay tests for the induction of somatic mutation and mitotic recombination in cells of the developing wing primordia. All PAs tested except the C9-monoester supinine were clearly genotoxic. Depending on their chemical structure, however, genotoxicity of the PAs varied widely in a range encompassing about three orders of magnitude. In general, macrocyclic diester-type PAs were the most and 7-hydroxy C9-monoester types the least genotoxic representatives studied, while open diesters were intermediate in this respect. Stereoisomeric PAs mostly showed similar, but sometimes also clearly unequal genotoxicity. An increasing number of hydroxy groups in the PA molecule seemed to reduce its genotoxic potency. With respect to the structure/activity relationships, there appears to be a good correlation between hepatotoxicity of PAs in experimental rodents and genotoxicity in the wing spot test of Drosophila. This suggests that PAs are bioactivated along similar pathways in the mammalian liver and in the somatic cells of Drosophila. The genotoxic potential of PAs in the Drosophila wing spot test and their carcinogenic potential in mammals also seem correlated, although the information in the literature on carcinogenicity of the non-macrocyclic PAs with moderate to low genotoxic potency is concededly limited. Comparisons with other genotoxicity tests suggest that the wing spot test is particularly suitable for genotoxins like PAs, on the one hand because of the versatile metabolic bioactivation system of Drosophila and on the other hand also because of its excellent sensitivity to the crosslinking agents among the genotoxins.",1992,"H Frei, J LÃ¼thy, J Brauchli, U Zweifel, F E WÃ¼rgler, C Schlatter, H Frei, J LÃ¼thy, J Brauchli, U Zweifel, F E WÃ¼rgler, C Schlatter"
[P transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster: horizontal transfer],1339594,,"The P transposable element family in Drosophila melanogaster is responsible for the syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis which includes chromosomal rearrangements, male recombination, high mutability and temperature sensitive agametic sterility (called gonadal dysgenesis sterility). P element activity is controlled by a complex regulation system, encoded by the elements themselves, which keeps their transposition rate low within the strain bearing P elements and limits copy number by genome. A second regulatory mechanism, which acts on the level of RNA processing, prevents P mobility to somatic cells. The oldest available strains, representing most major geographical regions of the world, exhibited no detectable hybridization to the P-element. In contrast, all recently collected natural populations that were tested carried P-element sequences. The available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of a worldwide P-element invasion of D. melanogaster during the past 30 years. Timing and direction of the invasion are discussed. The lack of P-element in older strains of Drosophila melanogaster as well as in the species must closely related to Drosophila melanogaster, suggests that P entered the Drosophila melanogaster genome recently, probably by horizontal transfer from an other species. The analysis of P-element elsewhere in the genus Drosophila reveals that several more distantly related species carried transposable elements with sequences quite similar to P. The species with the best-matching P-element is D. willistoni. A P-element from this species was found to match all but one of the 2907 nucleotides of the Drosophila melanogaster P-element.

The procedure involves Phenyl-Sepharose, Reactive Red-Agarose and Q-Sepharose fast flow (or MonoQ) chromatographic steps.

The mean number of MDG1 and copia euchromatic hybridization sites (3 sites for each element) is drastically decreased in D. simulans in comparison with D. melanogaster (24 and 18 sites respectively). The mean number of MDG3 sites of hybridization is 5 in D. simulans against 12 in D. melanogaster. As for MDG4 both species have on the average about 2-3 euchromatic sites. The majority of MDG1 and copia and about a half of MDG3 euchromatic copies are localized in restricted number of sites (hot spots) on D. simulans polytene chromosomes. In D. melanogaster these elements are scattered along the chromosomes though there are some hot spots too. It appears that euchromatic copies of MDG1 and copia are considerably less mobile in D. simulans in contrast to D. melanogaster. Some common hot spots of retrotransposon localization in D. simulans and D. melanogaster were earlier described as intercalary heterochromatin regions in D. melanogaster. The level of interstrain variability of MDG4 hybridization sites is comparable in both species. Comparative blot-analysis of adult and larval salivary gland DNA shows that MDG1 and copia are situated mainly in euchromatic regions of D. melanogaster chromosomes. In D. simulans genome they are located mainly in heterochromatic regions underreplicated in salivary gland polytene chromosomes.

These molecules were efficiently secreted (up to 4 mg/liter) as noncovalent heterodimers and purified to homogeneity from cell supernatants. The isolated soluble Kb molecules were devoid of endogenous peptides. Using these molecules, we have characterized the Kb heavy chain-beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2m) assembly as well as peptide binding in vitro. In detergent-free solution the heavy chains readily re-assembled with beta 2m even in the absence of peptides. Kinetic analyses showed that the peptide binding is rapid and reversible and dependent on the heavy chains being assembled with beta 2m. Likewise, peptide dissociated from Kb molecules without the displacement of beta 2m. Equilibrium binding experiments using various peptides confirmed that octapeptides bind to Kb molecules with the highest affinity and form the most stable complexes. However, in contrast to earlier studies, the amino-terminal positioning of peptide to Kb molecules was more crucial than the carboxyl-terminal positioning and amidation of the peptide carboxylate did not affect the binding. Soluble Kb molecules could selectively bind allele-specific peptides among a mixture of randomly synthesized octapeptides in vitro; however, no dominant residue was observed at the carboxyl terminus of bound peptides. This suggests that the previously observed hydrophobic residues at the carboxyl terminus of peptides may reflect the specificity of enzyme(s) or protein(s) involved in peptide processing in vivo.",1992,"M Matsumura, Y Saito, M R Jackson, E S Song, P A Peterson, M Matsumura, Y Saito, M R Jackson, E S Song, P A Peterson"
A conserved regulatory unit implicated in tissue-specific gene expression in Drosophila and man,1547943,10.1101/gad.6.3.454,"The Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene is expressed in a specific set of tissues during larval development and in adults. Expression in the adult fat body is controlled by the Adh adult enhancer (AAE). Previous studies identified a negative regulatory element in the AAE and a protein that binds specifically to this sequence [adult enhancer factor-1 (AEF-1)]. Here, we show that the AEF-1-binding site in the AAE and in two other Drosophila fat body enhancers overlaps a sequence recognized by the mammalian transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP). Remarkably, these two proteins also bind specifically to overlapping sites in a liver-specific regulatory element of the human Adh gene. Cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells reveal that C/EBP stimulates the activity of the AAE by 50-fold, and this activity can be suppressed by AEF-1. In addition, AEF-1 prevents C/EBP binding in vitro, and displaces prebound C/EBP. Thus, a tissue-specific regulatory unit consisting of one positive and one negative regulatory element has been conserved between Drosophila and man.",1992,"D Falb, T Maniatis, D Falb, T Maniatis"

Embryonic cAMP and developmental potential in Drosophila melanogaster,28305849,10.1007/BF00188756,"Measurements of cAMP in early embryos of Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that the dunce gene plays a major role, and the rutabaga gene a secondary role, in maternal regulation of embryonic cAMP content. Studying the double mutant combination, we find that variability in elevated cAMP content between individual embryos is associated with a wide variability in developmental potential. Embryos with about five times the normal cAMP content define a threshold between apparently normal and abnormal development. Measurements of cAMP content in anterior and posterior halves of embryos indicate that the posterior embryonic region, which is developmentally more sensitive to the effects of elevated cAMP than the anterior region, does not contain more cAMP than the anterior region.

The levels of amylase activity and amylase protein, as well as the abundance of amylase-specific RNA, were quantified. All 3 parameters of Amy expression were concordant. Results indicate that the effects of both mapP and dietary glucose are exerted at the level of amylase RNA. However, the tissue-specific effects of mapP are restricted to the posterior midgut and can therefore be distinguished from the effects of glucose in food medium, which influences amylase RNA levels in both the anterior and posterior midgut regions. Our data suggest that, in large part, strain-specific effects of dietary glucose can be explained on the basis of alternate alleles at the mapP locus in different homozygous strains of flies. Levels of amylase RNA in tissue extracts of flies from an amylase-null strain were also measured. Low levels were observed in both anterior and posterior midgut extracts.

"Cloning and functional expression of Dfurin2, a subtilisin-like proprotein processing enzyme of Drosophila melanogaster with multiple repeats of a cysteine motif",1512259,,"Production of a variety of regulatory eukaryotic proteins, such as growth factors and polypeptide hormones, often involves endoproteolytic processing of proproteins at cleavage sites consisting of paired basic residues. The first known mammalian proprotein processing enzyme with such specificity is the human fur gene product furin. Structurally and functionally, furin is related to the subtilisin-like serine endoprotease kexin (EC 3.4.21.61) of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; unlike kexin, it contains a cysteine-rich region with an unknown function. Here, we describe cloning and sequencing of a 5.8-kbp cDNA of the Dfur2 gene, a fur-like gene of Drosophila melanogaster, which we found expressed during various stages of development. This Dfur2 cDNA has an open reading frame for a 1680-residue protein, called Dfurin2. Dfurin2 contains similar protein domains as mammalian furin, however, it has an extended amino-terminal region and its cysteine-rich region is much larger than that of mammalian furin. Because of this latter phenomenon, we were able to identify a particular cysteine motif that was repeated multiple times in Dfurin2 but present only twice in mammalian furin. Furthermore, we show that Dfur2 encodes an endoproteolytic enzyme with specificity for paired basic amino acid residues as, in cotransfection experiments, correct cleavage was demonstrated of the precursor of the von Willebrand factor but not of a cleavage mutant.

In this study totally non-susceptible lines, and susceptible lines containing exclusively KP elements (IINS2 line and IIS2 line) were isolated from a M' strain. We show that non-susceptibility is correlated with a particular insertion of one KP element located at the cytological site 47D1.

In this study, we characterized in vivo modification states of Drosophila calmodulin using proteomic methodology involving the protein mapping of microdissected Drosophila tissues on 2-D gels. We found that Drosophila calmodulin was highly expressed in methylated forms in the compound eye, whereas its methylation was hardly detected in other tissues.

We find that developmental programmed cell death stimuli in vivo and multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo induce dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of effector caspase activation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and nuclear condensation in Drosophila cells. Unlike genotoxic stress, a lipid cell death mediator induced an increase in mitochondrial contiguity prior to fragmentation of the mitochondria. Using genetic mutants and RNAi-mediated knockdown of drp-1, we find that Drp-1 not only regulates mitochondrial fission in normal cells, but mediates mitochondrial fragmentation during programmed cell death. Mitochondria in drp-1 mutants fail to fragment, resulting in hyperplasia of tissues in vivo and protection of cells from multiple apoptotic stimuli ex vivo.

Mammalian ASH1L is a histone methyltransferase that occupies the transcribed region of active genes,17923682,10.1128/MCB.00993-07,"Histone lysine methylation regulates genomic functions, including gene transcription. Previous reports found various degrees of methylation at H3K4, H3K9, and H4K20 within the transcribed region of active mammalian genes. To identify the enzymes responsible for placing these modifications, we examined ASH1L, the mammalian homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Trithorax group (TrxG) protein Ash1. Drosophila Ash1 has been reported to methylate H3K4, H3K9, and H4K20 at its target sites. Here we demonstrate that mammalian ASH1L associates with the transcribed region of all active genes examined, including Hox genes. The distribution of ASH1L in transcribed chromatin strongly resembles that of methylated H3K4 but not that of H3K9 or H4K20. Accordingly, the SET domain of ASH1L methylates H3K4 in vitro, and knockdown of ASH1L expression reduced H3K4 trimethylation at HoxA10 in vivo. Notably, prior methylation at H3K9 reduced ASH1L-mediated methylation at H3K4, suggesting cross-regulation among these marks. Drosophila ash1 and trithorax interact genetically, and the mammalian TrxG protein MLL1 and ASH1L display highly similar distributions and substrate specificities. However, by using MLL null cell lines we found that their recruitments occur independently of each other.

Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila,17409186,10.1073/pnas.0701572104,"We have estimated the selective effects of amino acid replacements in natural populations by comparing levels of polymorphism in 91 genes in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster with their divergence from Drosophila simulans. The genes include about equal numbers whose level of expression in adults is greater in males, greater in females, or approximately equal in the sexes. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample key parameters in the stationary distribution of polymorphism and divergence in a model in which the selective effect of each nonsynonymous mutation is regarded as a random sample from some underlying normal distribution whose mean may differ from one gene to the next. Our analysis suggests that approximately 95% of all nonsynonymous mutations that could contribute to polymorphism or divergence are deleterious, and that the average proportion of deleterious amino acid polymorphisms in samples is approximately 70%. On the other hand, approximately 95% of fixed differences between species are positively selected, although the scaled selection coefficient (N(e)s) is very small. We estimate that approximately 46% of amino acid replacements have N(e)s < 2, approximately 84% have N(e)s < 4, and approximately 99% have N(e)s < 7. Although positive selection among amino acid differences between species seems pervasive, most of the selective effects could be regarded as nearly neutral.

Contrasting infection strategies in generalist and specialist wasp parasitoids of Drosophila melanogaster,17967061,10.1371/journal.ppat.0030158,"Although host-parasitoid interactions are becoming well characterized at the organismal and cellular levels, much remains to be understood of the molecular bases for the host immune response and the parasitoids' ability to defeat this immune response. Leptopilina boulardi and L. heterotoma, two closely related, highly infectious natural parasitoids of Drosophila melanogaster, appear to use very different infection strategies at the cellular level. Here, we further characterize cellular level differences in the infection characteristics of these two wasp species using newly derived, virulent inbred strains, and then use whole genome microarrays to compare the transcriptional response of Drosophila to each. While flies attacked by the melanogaster group specialist L. boulardi (strain Lb17) up-regulate numerous genes encoding proteolytic enzymes, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and the melanization cascade as part of a combined cellular and humoral innate immune response, flies attacked by the generalist L. heterotoma (strain Lh14) do not appear to initiate an immune transcriptional response at the time points post-infection we assayed, perhaps due to the rapid venom-mediated lysis of host hemocytes (blood cells). Thus, the specialist parasitoid appears to invoke a full-blown immune response in the host, but suppresses and/or evades downstream components of this response. Given that activation of the host immune response likely depletes the energetic resources of the host, the specialist's infection strategy seems relatively disadvantageous.

Characterization of PER lacking this motif (PER Delta) shows that it is important for phosphorylation of Drosophila PER by casein kinase I epsilon (CKI epsilon; doubletime protein or DBT) and CKII. S2 cell assays indicate that the domain also contributes significantly to PER nuclear localization as well as to PER transcriptional repressor activity. These two phenomena appear linked, since PER Delta transcriptional repressor activity in S2 cells was restored when nuclear localization was facilitated. Two less direct assays of PER Delta activity in flies can be interpreted similarly. The separate assay of nuclear import and export suggests that the domain functions in part to facilitate PER phosphorylation within the cytoplasm, which in turn promotes nuclear entry. As there is evidence that the kinases also function within the nucleus to promote transcriptional repression, we suggest that there is a subsequent collaboration between phosphorylated PER and the kinases to repress CLK-CYC activity, probably through the phosphorylation of CLK. This is then followed by additional PER phosphorylation, which occurs within the nucleus and leads to PER degradation.",2007,"Pipat Nawathean, Dan Stoleru, Michael Rosbash, Pipat Nawathean, Dan Stoleru, Michael Rosbash"

Drosophila PER (dPER) functions in the negative limb of the clockworks by presumably binding to the transcription factor CLOCK (CLK) and inhibiting its transactivation activity. Here, we identify a small region on dPER that is conserved with mammalian PERs and contains the major in vivo DBT binding domain, termed dPDBD (for dPER DBT binding domain). This domain is required for the manifestation of molecular and behavioral rhythms in vivo. In the absence of the dPDBD, the dPER protein is present at constant high levels throughout a daily cycle, undergoes little phosphorylation, and is severely impaired in its ability to function as a transcriptional repressor. Our findings indicate that the binding of dPER to CLK is not sufficient for transcriptional inhibition, implicating a more indirect mode of action whereby dPER acts as a molecular bridge to ""deliver"" DBT and/or other factors that directly repress CLK-dependent gene expression.",2007,"Eun Young Kim, Hyuk Wan Ko, Wangjie Yu, Paul E Hardin, Isaac Edery, Eun Young Kim, Hyuk Wan Ko, Wangjie Yu, Paul E Hardin, Isaac Edery"

Comparative genomics reveals a constant rate of origination and convergent acquisition of functional retrogenes in Drosophila,17233920,10.1186/gb-2007-8-1-r11,"Background:
      
    

    
      Processed copies of genes (retrogenes) are duplicate genes that originated through the reverse-transcription of a host transcript and insertion in the genome. This type of gene duplication, as any other, could be a source of new genes and functions. Using whole genome sequence data for 12 Drosophila species, we dated the origin of 94 retroposition events that gave rise to candidate functional genes in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Based on this analysis, we infer that functional retrogenes have emerged at a fairly constant rate of 0.5 genes per million years per lineage over the last approximately 63 million years of Drosophila evolution. The number of functional retrogenes and the rate at which they are recruited in the D. melanogaster lineage are of the same order of magnitude as those estimated in the human lineage, despite the higher deletion bias in the Drosophila genome. However, unlike primates, the rate of retroposition in Drosophila seems to be fairly constant and no burst of retroposition can be inferred from our analyses. In addition, our data also support an important role for retrogenes as a source of lineage-specific male functions, in agreement with previous hypotheses. Finally, we identified three cases of functional retrogenes in D. melanogaster that have been independently retroposed and recruited in parallel as new genes in other Drosophila lineages.

        Results:
      
    

    
      I used Affymetrix Drosophila Genome arrays to identify genes whose expression profiles would change rapidly due to the social interactions occurring during Drosophila melanogaster courtship. I identified 43 loci with significant expression profile changes during a 5-min exposure period. These results indicate that social interactions can lead to extremely rapid changes in mRNA abundance.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The known functions of the up-regulated genes identified in this study include nervous system signaling and spermatogenesis, while the majority of down-regulated loci are implicated in immune signaling. Expression of two of the up-regulated genes, Odorant-binding protein 99b (Obp99b) and female-specific independent of transformer (fit), is controlled by the Drosophila sex-determination gene hierarchy, which regulates male and female mating behaviors and somatic differentiation. Therefore, additional identified loci may represent other long-elusive targets of Drosophila sex-determination genes.",2007,"Ginger E Carney, Ginger E Carney"
Moonlight shifts the endogenous clock of Drosophila melanogaster,17307880,10.1073/pnas.0606870104,"The ability to be synchronized by light-dark cycles is a fundamental property of circadian clocks. Although there are indications that circadian clocks are extremely light-sensitive and that they can be set by the low irradiances that occur at dawn and dusk, this has not been shown on the cellular level. Here, we demonstrate that a subset of Drosophila's pacemaker neurons responds to nocturnal dim light. At a nighttime illumination comparable to quarter-moonlight intensity, the flies increase activity levels and shift their typical morning and evening activity peaks into the night. In parallel, clock protein levels are reduced, and clock protein rhythms shift in opposed direction in subsets of the previously identified morning and evening pacemaker cells. No effect was observed on the peripheral clock in the eye. Our results demonstrate that the neurons driving rhythmic behavior are extremely light-sensitive and capable of shifting activity in response to the very low light intensities that regularly occur in nature. This sensitivity may be instrumental in adaptation to different photoperiods, as was proposed by the morning and evening oscillator model of Pittendrigh and Daan. We also show that this adaptation depends on retinal input but is independent of cryptochrome.",2007,"Wolfgang Bachleitner, Lena Kempinger, Corinna WÃ¼lbeck, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Wolfgang Bachleitner, Lena Kempinger, Corinna WÃ¼lbeck, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster"
Piperonyl butoxide induces the expression of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase genes in Drosophila melanogaster,17514638,10.1002/ps.1391,"Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is an insecticide synergist known to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes. PBO is currently used in some insecticide formulations, and has also been suggested as a pretreatment for some pesticide applications. Little is known about how insects respond to PBO exposure at the gene transcription level. The authors have characterised the transcriptional response of the Drosophila melanogaster genome after PBO treatment, using both a custom-designed 'detox' microarray, containing cytochrome P450 (P450), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase genes, and a full genome microarray. A subset of P450 and GST genes is identified, along with additional metabolic genes, that are induced by PBO. The gene set is an extremely similar gene set to that induced by phenobarbital, a compound for which pretreatment is known to confer tolerance to a range of insecticide compounds. The implications of the induction of gene families known to metabolise insecticides and the use of PBO in pest management programs are discussed.",2007,"Lee Willoughby, Philip Batterham, Phillip J Daborn, Lee Willoughby, Philip Batterham, Phillip J Daborn"

Expression of dominant-negative Dmp53 in the adult fly brain inhibits insulin signaling,17686972,10.1073/pnas.0706121104,"In Drosophila melanogaster, p53 (Dmp53) is an important mediator of longevity. Expression of dominant-negative (DN) forms of Dmp53 in adult neurons, but not in muscle or fat body cells, extends lifespan. The lifespan of calorie-restricted flies is not further extended by simultaneously expressing DN-Dmp53 in the nervous system, indicating that a decrease in Dmp53 activity may be a part of the CR lifespan-extending pathway in flies. In this report, we show that selective expression of DN-Dmp53 in only the 14 insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain extends lifespan to the same extent as expression in all neurons and this lifespan extension is not additive with CR. DN-Dmp53-dependent lifespan extension is accompanied by reduction of Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2 (dILP2) mRNA levels and reduced insulin signaling (IIS) in the fat body, which suggests that Dmp53 may affect lifespan by modulating insulin signaling in the fly.",2007,"Johannes H Bauer, Chengyi Chang, Siti Nur Sarah Morris, Suzanne Hozier, Sandra Andersen, Joshua S Waitzman, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer, Chengyi Chang, Siti Nur Sarah Morris, Suzanne Hozier, Sandra Andersen, Joshua S Waitzman, Stephen L Helfand"

Synthetic lethality of Drosophila in the absence of the MUS81 endonuclease and the DmBlm helicase is associated with elevated apoptosis,17603121,10.1534/genetics.106.070060,"Mus81-Mms4 (Mus81-Eme1 in some species) is a heterodimeric DNA structure-specific endonuclease that has been implicated in meiotic recombination and processing of damaged replication forks in fungi. We generated and characterized mutations in Drosophila melanogaster mus81 and mms4. Unlike the case in fungi, we did not find any role for MUS81-MMS4 in meiotic crossing over. A possible role for this endonuclease in repairing double-strand breaks that arise during DNA replication is suggested by the finding that mus81 and mms4 mutants are hypersensitive to camptothecin; however, these mutants are not hypersensitive to other agents that generate lesions that slow or block DNA replication. In fungi, mus81, mms4, and eme1 mutations are synthetically lethal with mutations in genes encoding RecQ helicase homologs. Similarly, we found that mutations in Drosophila mus81 and mms4 are synthetically lethal with null mutations in mus309, which encodes the ortholog of the Bloom Syndrome helicase. Synthetic lethality is associated with high levels of apoptosis in proliferating tissues. Lethality and elevated apoptosis were partially suppressed by a mutation in spn-A, which encodes the ortholog of the strand invasion protein Rad51. These findings provide insights into the causes of synthetic lethality.",2007,"Kirsten Trowbridge, Kim McKim, Steven J Brill, Jeff Sekelsky, Kirsten Trowbridge, Kim McKim, Steven J Brill, Jeff Sekelsky"
Effect of divergence time and recombination rate on molecular evolution of Drosophila INE-1 transposable elements and other candidates for neutrally evolving sites,17896069,10.1007/s00239-007-9028-6,"Interspecies divergence of orthologous transposable element remnants is often assumed to be simply due to genetic drift of neutral mutations that occurred after the divergence of the species. However, divergence may also be affected by other factors, such as variation in the mutation rate, ancestral polymorphisms, or selection. Here we attempt to determine the impact of these forces on divergence of three classes of sites that are often assumed to be selectively unconstrained (INE-1 TE remnants, sites within short introns, and fourfold degenerate sites) in two different pairwise comparisons of Drosophila (D. melanogaster vs. D. simulans and D. simulans vs. D. sechellia). We find that divergence of these three classes of sites is strongly influenced by the recombination environment in which they are located, and this is especially true for the closer D. simulans vs. D. sechellia comparison. We suggest that this is mainly a result of the contribution of ancestral polymorphisms in different recombination regions. We also find that intergenic INE-1 elements are significantly more diverged than intronic INE-1 in both pairwise comparisons, implying the presence of either negative selection or lower mutation rates in introns. Furthermore, we show that substitution rates in INE-1 elements are not associated with the length of the noncoding sequence in which they are located, suggesting that reduced divergence in long noncoding sequences is not due to reduced mutation rates in these regions. Finally, we show that GC content for each site within INE-1 sequences has evolved toward an equilibrium value (approximately 33%) since insertion.",2007,"Jun Wang, Peter D Keightley, Daniel L Halligan, Jun Wang, Peter D Keightley, Daniel L Halligan"

Purifying selection maintains highly conserved noncoding sequences in Drosophila,17646256,10.1093/molbev/msm150,"The majority of metazoan genomes consist of nonprotein-coding regions, although the functional significance of most noncoding DNA sequences remains unknown. Highly conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding RNA genes. However, CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes such as genomic regions with extremely low mutation rates known as mutation ""cold spots."" Here we combine comparative genomic data from recently completed insect genome projects with population genetic data in Drosophila melanogaster to test predictions of the mutational cold spot model of CNS evolution in the genus Drosophila. We find that point mutations in intronic and intergenic CNSs exhibit a significant reduction in levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism, as well as a significant excess of rare derived alleles, compared with either the nonconserved spacer regions between CNSs or with 4-fold silent sites in coding regions. Controlling for the effects of purifying selection, we find no evidence of positive selection acting on Drosophila CNSs, although we do find evidence for the action of recurrent positive selection in the spacer regions between CNSs. We estimate that approximately 85% of sites in Drosophila CNSs are under constraint with selection coefficients (N(e)s) on the order of 10-100, and thus, the estimated strength and number of sites under purifying selection is greater for Drosophila CNSs relative to those in the human genome. These patterns of nonneutral molecular evolution are incompatible with the mutational cold spot hypothesis to explain the existence of CNSs in Drosophila and, coupled with similar findings in mammals, argue against the general likelihood that CNSs are generated by mutational cold spots in any metazoan genome.",2007,"SÃ²nia Casillas, Antonio Barbadilla, Casey M Bergman, SÃ²nia Casillas, Antonio Barbadilla, Casey M Bergman"
Evidence for recent horizontal transfer of gypsy-homologous LTR-retrotransposon gtwin into Drosophila erecta followed by its amplification with multiple aberrations,17459613,10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.019,"Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon gtwin was initially discovered in silico, and then it was isolated as gypsy-homologous sequence from Drosophila melanogaster strain, G32. The presence of ORF3 suggests, that gtwin, like gypsy, may be an endogenous retrovirus, which can leave the cell and infect another one. Therefore, in this study we decided to investigate the distribution of gtwin in different species of the melanogaster subgroup in order to find out whether gtwin can be transferred horizontally as well as vertically. Gtwin was found in all 9 species of this subgroup, hence it seems to have inhabited the host genomes for a long time. In addition, we have shown that in the Drosophila erecta genome two gtwin families are present. The first one has 93% of identity to D. melanogaster element and is likely to be a descendant of gtwin that existed in Drosophila before the divergence of the melanogaster subgroup species. The other one has >99% of identity to D. melanogaster gtwin. The most reasonable explanation is that this element has been recently horizontally transferred between D. melanogaster and D. erecta. The number and variety of gtwin copies from the ""infectious"" family suggest that after the horizontal transfer into D. erecta genome, gtwin underwent amplification and aberrations, leading to the rise of its diverse variants.",2007,"Alina P Kotnova, Ivan A Glukhov, Nina N Karpova, Veniamin B Salenko, Natalia V Lyubomirskaya, Yuriy V Ilyin"
Adult locomotory activity mediates intralocus sexual conflict in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster,17925279,10.1098/rspb.2007.1140,"The strongest form of intralocus sexual conflict occurs when two conditions are met: (i) there is a positive intersexual genetic correlation for a trait and (ii) the selection gradients on the trait in the two sexes are in opposite directions. Intralocus sexual conflict can constrain the adaptive evolution of both sexes and thereby contribute to a species' 'gender load'. Previous studies of adult lifetime fitness of the same sets of genes expressed in both males and females have established that there is substantial intralocus conflict in the LHM laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we investigated whether a highly dimorphic trait-adult locomotory activity-contributed substantially to the established intralocus sexual conflict. To measure the selection gradient on activity level, both this trait and adult lifetime fitness were measured under the same environmental conditions to which the flies were adapted. We found significant phenotypic variation in both sexes for adult locomotory activity, and that the selection gradients on this variation were large and in opposite directions in the two sexes. Using hemiclonal analysis to screen 99% of the entire genome, we found abundant genetic variation for adult locomotory activity and showed that this variation occurs on both the X and autosomes. We also established that there is a strong positive intersexual genetic correlation for locomotory activity. These assays revealed that, despite the strong, extant sexual dimorphism for the trait, locomotory activity continues to contribute strongly to intralocus sexual conflict in this population.",2007,"Tristan A F Long, William R Rice, Tristan A F Long, William R Rice"
A proteome catalog of Drosophila melanogaster: an essential resource for targeted quantitative proteomics,18820430,10.4161/fly.4532,"Proteomic analyses are critically important for systems biology because important aspects related to the structure, function and control of biological systems are only amenable by direct protein measurements. It has become apparent that the current proteomics technologies are unlikely to allow routine, quantitative measurements of whole proteomes. We have therefore suggested and largely implemented a two-step strategy for quantitative proteome analysis. In a first step, the discovery phase, the proteome observable by mass spectrometry is extensively analyzed. The resulting proteome catalog can then be used to select peptides specific to only one protein, so-called proteotypic peptides (PTPs). It represents the basis to realize sensitive, robust and reproducible measurements based on targeted mass spectrometry of these PTPs in a subsequent scoring phase. In this Extra View we describe the need for such proteome catalogs and their multiple benefits for catalyzing the shift towards targeted quantitative proteomic analysis and beyond. We use the Insulin signaling cascade as a representative example to illustrate the limitations of currently used proteomics approaches for the specific analysis of individual pathway components, and describe how the recently published Drosophila proteome catalog already helped to overcome many of these limitations.",2007,"Christian H Ahrens, Erich Brunner, Ernst Hafen, Ruedi Aebersold, Konrad Basler, Christian H Ahrens, Erich Brunner, Ernst Hafen, Ruedi Aebersold, Konrad Basler"
Mitch a rapidly evolving component of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex required for correct chromosome segregation in Drosophila,17895365,10.1242/jcs.012112,"We identified an essential kinetochore protein, Mitch, from a genetic screen in D. melanogaster. Mitch localizes to the kinetochore, and its targeting is independent of microtubules (MTs) and several other known kinetochore components. Animals carrying mutations in mitch die as late third-instar larvae; mitotic neuroblasts in larval brains exhibit high levels of aneuploidy. Analysis of fixed D. melanogaster brains and mitch RNAi in cultured cells, as well as video recordings of cultured mitch mutant neuroblasts, reveal that chromosome alignment in mitch mutants is compromised during spindle formation, with many chromosomes displaying persistent mono-orientation. These misalignments lead to aneuploidy during anaphase. Mutations in mitch also disrupt chromosome behavior during both meiotic divisions in spermatocytes: the entire chromosome complement often moves to only one spindle pole. Mutant mitotic cells exhibit contradictory behavior with respect to the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Anaphase onset is delayed in untreated cells, probably because incorrect kinetochore attachment maintains the SAC. However, mutant brain cells and mitch RNAi cells treated with MT poisons prematurely disjoin their chromatids, and exit mitosis. These data suggest that Mitch participates in SAC signaling that responds specifically to disruptions in spindle microtubule dynamics. The mitch gene corresponds to the transcriptional unit CG7242, and encodes a protein that is a possible ortholog of the Spc24 or Spc25 subunit of the Ndc80 kinetochore complex. Despite the crucial role of Mitch in cell division, the mitch gene has evolved very rapidly among species in the genus Drosophila.",2007,"Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg, Byron Williams, Garmay Leung, Helder Maiato, Alex Wong, Zexiao Li, Erika V Williams, Catherine Kirkpatrick, Charles F Aquadro, Conly L Rieder, Michael L Goldberg"
The use of a non-LTR element to date the formation of the Sdic gene cluster,17351817,10.1007/s10709-007-9141-x,"Transposable elements comprise a considerable part of eukaryotic genomes, and there is increasing evidence for their role in the evolution of genomes. The number of active transposable elements present in the host genome at any given time is probably small relative to the number of elements that no longer transpose. The elements that have lost the ability to transpose tend to evolve neutrally. For example, non-LTR retrotransposons often become 5' truncated due to their own transposition mechanism and hence lose their ability to transpose. The resulting transposons can be characterized as ""dead-on-arrival"" (DOA) elements. Because they are abundant and ubiquitous, and evolve neutrally in the location where they were inserted, these DOA non-LTR elements make a useful tool to date molecular events. There are four copies of a ""dead-on-arrival"" RT1C element on the recently formed Sdic gene cluster of Drosophila melanogaster, that are not present in the equivalent region of the other species of the melanogaster subgroup. The life history of the RT1C elements in the genome of D. melanogaster was used to determine the insertion chronology of the elements in the cluster and to date the duplication events that originated this cluster.",2007,"Rita Ponce, Rita Ponce"
A Hedgehog- and Antennapedia-dependent niche maintains Drosophila haematopoietic precursors,17361183,10.1038/nature05585,"The Drosophila melanogaster lymph gland is a haematopoietic organ in which pluripotent blood cell progenitors proliferate and mature into differentiated haemocytes. Previous work has defined three domains, the medullary zone, the cortical zone and the posterior signalling centre (PSC), within the developing third-instar lymph gland. The medullary zone is populated by a core of undifferentiated, slowly cycling progenitor cells, whereas mature haemocytes comprising plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes are peripherally located in the cortical zone. The PSC comprises a third region that was first defined as a small group of cells expressing the Notch ligand Serrate. Here we show that the PSC is specified early in the embryo by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) and expresses the signalling molecule Hedgehog. In the absence of the PSC or the Hedgehog signal, the precursor population of the medullary zone is lost because cells differentiate prematurely. We conclude that the PSC functions as a haematopoietic niche that is essential for the maintenance of blood cell precursors in Drosophila. Identification of this system allows the opportunity for genetic manipulation and direct in vivo imaging of a haematopoietic niche interacting with blood precursors.",2007,"Lolitika Mandal, Julian A Martinez-Agosto, Cory J Evans, Volker Hartenstein, Utpal Banerjee, Lolitika Mandal, Julian A Martinez-Agosto, Cory J Evans, Volker Hartenstein, Utpal Banerjee"
Superoxide dismutase activities in long-lived Drosophila melanogaster females: chico1 genotypes and dietary dilution,17103233,10.1007/s10522-006-9065-3,"Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were determined for dietary dilution conditions that extend the life span of Drosophila melanogaster. The hypothesis motivating this research was that elevated SOD activity is associated with increased life span resulting from flies being held on a restricted diet. SOD activities were also measured for chico (1) which is a mutation in the insulin receptor substrate protein gene associated with life span extension. This allowed us to confirm the results of (Clancy et al. 2001) and extend the results by measuring CuZn SOD and Mn SOD activities in addition to the previously determined overall SOD activity. If the same form of SOD activity (CuZn SOD or Mn SOD) was elevated on the dilute diet that extends life span and in the long lived chico (1) homozygotes, then it would suggest that life span extension by dietary restriction and by insulin signaling mutations has a similar underlying mechanism. However, overall SOD activity, and CuZn SOD or Mn SOD activities did not differ among the diets tested. As observed previously (Clancy et al. 2001), overall SOD activity was elevated in chico (1) homozygotes compared to the heterozygote or wild type. Results from the present study indicate that elevated CuZn SOD activity, not Mn SOD, is the basis for the relatively high level of SOD activity in the chico (1) homozygotes.",2007,"Hadise Kabil, Linda Partridge, Lawrence G Harshman, Hadise Kabil, Linda Partridge, Lawrence G Harshman"

Efficient parameter estimation for spatio-temporal models of pattern formation: case study of Drosophila melanogaster,17893088,10.1093/bioinformatics/btm433,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Diffusable and non-diffusable gene products play a major role in body plan formation. A quantitative understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns formed in body plan formation, by using simulation models is an important addition to experimental observation. The inverse modelling approach consists of describing the body plan formation by a rule-based model, and fitting the model parameters to real observed data. In body plan formation, the data are usually obtained from fluorescent immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridizations. Inferring model parameters by comparing such data to those from simulation is a major computational bottleneck. An important aspect in this process is the choice of method used for parameter estimation. When no information on parameters is available, parameter estimation is mostly done by means of heuristic algorithms.

      We show that parameter estimation for pattern formation models can be efficiently performed using an evolution strategy (ES). As a case study we use a quantitative spatio-temporal model of the regulatory network for early development in Drosophila melanogaster. In order to estimate the parameters, the simulated results are compared to a time series of gene products involved in the network obtained with immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that a (mu,lambda)-ES can be used to find good quality solutions in the parameter estimation. We also show that an ES with multiple populations is 5-140 times as fast as parallel simulated annealing for this case study, and that combining ES with a local search results in an efficient parameter estimation method.",2007,"Yves Fomekong-Nanfack, Jaap A Kaandorp, Joke Blom, Yves Fomekong-Nanfack, Jaap A Kaandorp, Joke Blom"
"Reductase domain of Drosophila melanogaster nitric-oxide synthase: redox transformations, regulation, and similarity to mammalian homologues",17900149,10.1021/bi700805x,"The nitric oxide synthase of Drosophila melanogaster (dNOS) participates in essential developmental and behavioral aspects of the fruit fly, but little is known about dNOS catalysis and regulation. To address this, we expressed a construct comprising the dNOS reductase domain and its adjacent calmodulin (CaM) binding site (dNOSr) and characterized the protein regarding its catalytic, kinetic, and regulatory properties. The Ca2+ concentration required for CaM binding to dNOSr was between that of the mammalian endothelial and neuronal NOS enzymes. CaM binding caused the cytochrome c reductase activity of dNOSr to increase 4 times and achieve an activity comparable to that of mammalian neuronal NOS. This change was associated with decreased shielding of the FMN cofactor from solvent and an increase in the rate of NADPH-dependent flavin reduction. Flavin reduction in dNOSr was relatively slow following the initial 2-electron reduction, suggesting a slow inter-flavin electron transfer, and no charge-transfer complex was observed between bound NADP+ and reduced FAD during the process. We conclude that dNOSr catalysis and regulation is most similar to the mammalian neuronal NOS reductase domain, although differences exist in their flavin reduction behaviors.

Over 10-14 years, 1) the cross A GD scores of the northern-middle populations declined dramatically; 2) the clinal pattern of the cross A* GD scores did not change; 3) the latitudinal pattern of the KP/FP ratio did not change. The results suggest that only a few P elements determine P-M characteristics and that there has been selection for genomes with fewer active P elements, but not for a great change in proportions of size classes.",2007,"Keiji Ogura, R C Woodruff, Masanobu Itoh, Ian A Boussy, Keiji Ogura, R C Woodruff, Masanobu Itoh, Ian A Boussy"
Juvenile hormone resistance gene Methoprene-tolerant controls entry into metamorphosis in the beetle Tribolium castaneum,17537916,10.1073/pnas.0703719104,"Besides being a spectacular developmental process, metamorphosis is key to insect success. Entry into metamorphosis is controlled by juvenile hormone (JH). In larvae, JH prevents pupal and adult morphogenesis, thus keeping the insect in its immature state. How JH signals to preclude metamorphosis is poorly understood, and a JH receptor remains unknown. One candidate for the JH receptor role is the Methoprene-tolerant (Met) Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein [also called Resistance to JH, Rst (1)JH], whose loss confers tolerance to JH and its mimic methoprene in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, Met deficiency does not affect the larval-pupal transition, possibly because this process does not require JH absence in Drosophila. By contrast, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is sensitive to developmental regulation by JH, thus making an ideal system to examine the role of Met in the antimetamorphic JH action. Here we show that impaired function of the Met ortholog TcMet renders Tribolium resistant to the effects of ectopic JH and, in a striking contrast to Drosophila, causes early-stage beetle larvae to undergo precocious metamorphosis. This is evident as TcMet-deficient larvae pupate prematurely or develop specific heterochronic phenotypes such as pupal-like cuticular structures, appendages, and compound eyes. Our results demonstrate that TcMet functions in JH response and provide the critical evidence that the putative JH receptor Met mediates the antimetamorphic effect of JH.",2007,"Barbora Konopova, Marek Jindra, Barbora Konopova, Marek Jindra"
Principles of genome evolution in the Drosophila melanogaster species group,17550304,10.1371/journal.pbio.0050152,"That closely related species often differ by chromosomal inversions was discovered by Sturtevant and Plunkett in 1926. Our knowledge of how these inversions originate is still very limited, although a prevailing view is that they are facilitated by ectopic recombination events between inverted repetitive sequences. The availability of genome sequences of related species now allows us to study in detail the mechanisms that generate interspecific inversions. We have analyzed the breakpoint regions of the 29 inversions that differentiate the chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and two closely related species, D. simulans and D. yakuba, and reconstructed the molecular events that underlie their origin. Experimental and computational analysis revealed that the breakpoint regions of 59% of the inversions (17/29) are associated with inverted duplications of genes or other nonrepetitive sequences. In only two cases do we find evidence for inverted repetitive sequences in inversion breakpoints. We propose that the presence of inverted duplications associated with inversion breakpoint regions is the result of staggered breaks, either isochromatid or chromatid, and that this, rather than ectopic exchange between inverted repetitive sequences, is the prevalent mechanism for the generation of inversions in the melanogaster species group. Outgroup analysis also revealed evidence for widespread breakpoint recycling. Lastly, we have found that expression domains in D. melanogaster may be disrupted in D. yakuba, bringing into question their potential adaptive significance.",2007,"JosÃ© M Ranz, Damien Maurin, Yuk S Chan, Marcin von Grotthuss, LaDeana W Hillier, John Roote, Michael Ashburner, Casey M Bergman, JosÃ© M Ranz, Damien Maurin, Yuk S Chan, Marcin von Grotthuss, LaDeana W Hillier, John Roote, Michael Ashburner, Casey M Bergman"
Cytotype regulation by telomeric P elements in Drosophila melanogaster: evidence for involvement of an RNA interference gene,17603126,10.1534/genetics.106.066746,"P elements inserted at the left telomere of the X chromosome evoke the P cytotype, a maternally inherited condition that regulates the P-element family in the Drosophila germline. This regulation is completely disrupted in stocks heterozygous for mutations in aubergine, a gene whose protein product is involved in RNA interference. However, cytotype is not disrupted in stocks heterozygous for mutations in two other RNAi genes, piwi and homeless (spindle-E), or in a stock heterozygous for a mutation in the chromatin protein gene Enhancer of zeste. aubergine mutations exert their effects in the female germline, where the P cytotype is normally established and through which it is maintained. These effects are transmitted maternally to offspring of both sexes independently of the mutations themselves. Lines derived from mutant aubergine stocks reestablish the P cytotype quickly, unlike lines derived from stocks heterozygous for a mutation in Suppressor of variegation 205, the gene that encodes the telomere-capping protein HP1. Cytotype regulation by telomeric P elements may be tied to a system that uses RNAi to regulate the activities of telomeric retrotransposons in Drosophila.",2007,"Michael J Simmons, Don-Felix Ryzek, Cecile Lamour, Joseph W Goodman, Nicole E Kummer, Peter J Merriman, Michael J Simmons, Don-Felix Ryzek, Cecile Lamour, Joseph W Goodman, Nicole E Kummer, Peter J Merriman"

Serotonin receptor diversity has been described in the mammalian brain and in insects. We report the isolation of a cDNA coding for a Drosophila melanogaster serotonin receptor that displays a sequence, a gene organization, and pharmacological properties typical of the mammalian 5-HT2 serotonin receptor subtype. Its mRNA can be detected in the adult fly; moreover, a high level of expression occurs at 3 hr of Drosophila embryogenesis. This early embryonic expression is surprisingly organized in a seven-stripe pattern that appears at the cellular blastoderm stage. In addition, this pattern is in phase with that of the even-parasegment-expressed pair-rule gene fushi-tarazu and is similarly modified by mutations affecting segmentation genes. Simultaneously with this pair-rule expression, the complete machinery of serotonin synthesis is present and leads to a peak of ligand concomitant with a peak of 5-HT2-specific receptor sites in blastoderm embryos.",1995,"J F Colas, J M Launay, O Kellermann, P Rosay, L Maroteaux, J F Colas, J M Launay, O Kellermann, P Rosay, L Maroteaux"

Linear dose-response relationship and no inverse dose-rate effect observed for low X-ray dose-induced mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,7897279,10.1080/09553009514550361,"Mitotic recombination has emerged lately as a surprisingly common cause of recessive functional gene loss in mammalian cells and has been implicated in tumour suppressor gene loss in human neoplasms. In an assay, primarily monitoring mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, the ability of low dose acute- and chronic X-ray irradiation to induce clonal expression of recessive mutations of formally heterozygous loci was investigated. Mosaic spots of recessive wing-hair misshape mutations (mwh and flr) and of hair-into-bristles transforming mutation (zw3tic) were enhanced by a factor of two over control level following irradiation of heterozygous larvae to doses as low as 0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 Gy X-rays. The frequencies of mosaic spots induced with eight doses in the interval 0.01-2.0 Gy was linearly related to the dose. The regression lines show no significant intercept at zero dose. During the entire larval developmental period exposure of the exponentially growing target cell population to conditions of chronic irradiation at dose-rate of 15.7 x 10(-5) Gy/min provided no evidence of an inverse dose-rate effect as reported in yeast. In Drosophila, the probability of mitotic recombination per induced DNA double-strand break appears to be at least one order of magnitude higher than in man.",1995,"P M Schweizer, P M Schweizer"
Developmental analysis of the ovarian tumor gene during Drosophila oogenesis,8536967,,"Severe alleles of the ovarian tumor (otu) and ovo genes result in female sterility in Drosophila melanogaster, producing adult ovaries that completely lack egg chambers. We examined the developmental stage in which the agametic phenotype first becomes apparent.

We found that ovo- or otu- XX embryonic germ cells were indistinguishable in number and morphology from those present in wild-type siblings. The effects of the mutations were not consistently manifested in the female germline until pupariation, and there was no evidence that either gene was required for germ cell viability at earlier stages of development. The requirement for otu function in the pupal and adult ovary is supported by temperature-shift experiments using a heat-inducible otu gene construct. We demonstrate that otu activity limited to prepupal stages was not sufficient to support oogenesis, while induction during the pupal and adult periods caused suppression of the otu mutant phenotype.",1995,"C Rodesch, P K Geyer, J S Patton, E Bae, R N Nagoshi, C Rodesch, P K Geyer, J S Patton, E Bae, R N Nagoshi"
Drosophila GABA-gated chloride channel: modified [3H]EBOB binding site associated with Ala-->Ser or Gly mutants of Rdl subunit,7885191,10.1016/0024-3205(95)00006-r,"The non-competitive blocker site of the GABA-gated chloride ion channel in normal susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans binds 4-n-[3H]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([3H]EBOB) at specific sites with KdS of 1.6-1.9 nM and BmaxS of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. This specific binding of [3H]EBOB is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (lindane, alpha-endosulfan, dieldrin, 12-ketoendrin, fipronil, and a representative bicycloorthobenzoate and dithiane) or 200 nM (picrotoxinin); the insecticidal channel activators avermectin and moxidectin at 20 nM; muscimol at 30 microM and GABA at 300 microM. Cyclodiene resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an Ala302-->Ser replacement in the Rdl GABA receptor subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous Ala-->Ser or Gly replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce [3H]EBOB binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The Ala-->Ser replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting [3H]EBOB binding of each of eight channel blockers and of muscimol and GABA. The Ala-->Gly replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the Ala-->Ser modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to muscimol and GABA. The channel activators avermectin and moxidectin usually retain their inhibitory potency in the Rdl subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of Ala by Ser generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the GABA-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the Ala-->Gly replacement has less impact in protecting the chloride channel from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to avermectins and muscimol.",1995,"L M Cole, R T Roush, J E Casida, L M Cole, R T Roush, J E Casida"

Thus, metaphase arrest defines a control point in the meiotic cell cycle. Metaphase arrest only occurs in oocytes that have undergone at least one meiotic exchange. Here it is shown that crossovers between homologs attached to the same centromere do not induce metaphase arrest. Hence, exchanges induce metaphase arrest only when they physically conjoin two separate kinetochores.

Identification of two Drosophila TGF-beta family members in the grasshopper Schistocerca americana,7666445,10.1007/BF00170667,"Intercellular signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily are required for pattern formation in many multicellular organisms. The decapentaplegic (dpp) gene of Drosophila melanogaster has several developmental roles.

S. americana diverged from D. melanogaster approximately 350 million years ago, utilizes a distinct developmental program, and has a 60-fold-larger genome than D. melanogaster. Our analyses indicate a single dpp locus in D. melanogaster and S. americana, suggesting that dpp copy number does not correlate with increasing genome size. Another TGF-beta superfamily member, the D. melanogaster gene 60A, is also present in only one copy in each species. Comparison of homologous sequences from D. melanogaster, S. americana, and H. sapiens, representing roughly 900 million years of evolutionary distance, reveals significant constraint on sequence divergence for both dpp and 60A.

Comparison of ecdysteroid production in Drosophila and Manduca: pharmacology and cross-species neural reactivity,7579574,10.1002/arch.940300212,"In both Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, metamorphic events are driven by ecdysteroids whose production in prothoracic gland (PGs) is stimulated periodically by neural factors. Differences in the life cycle of moths and flies have made it difficult to compare the regulation of ecdysteroid biosynthesis in these two species. As in Manduca, at least two neural factors in the larval Drosophila BVG complex were separable by molecular weight, and they stimulated increased ecdysteroid biosynthesis from the ring gland, a composite organ that includes PG cells. Drosophila neural extracts accelerated ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Manduca PGs and, conversely, partially purified Manduca PTTH preparations elevated ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Drosophila ring glands, suggesting that the two species may share structurally similar prothoracicotropic factors. Drosophila ring glands required the presence of calcium ions to respond to neural extracts, but the phosphodiesterase inhibitor MIX and cAMP analogues exerted little, if any, positive effect on production. Mean ecdysteroid production rates of BVG-ring gland complexes taken from Drosophila larvae during various phases of the wandering period were often submaximal and highly variable, suggesting that they fluctuate widely prior to pupariation.

All three techniques demonstrated ChAT-expressing neurons in the larval visual system. In embryos, the photoreceptor organ (Bolwig's organ) exhibited strong cRNA hybridization signals. The optic lobe of late third-instar larvae displayed ChAT immunoreactivity in Bolwig's nerve and a neuron close to the insertion site of the optic stalk. This neuron's axon ran in parallel with Bolwig's nerve to the larval optic neuropil. This neuron is likely to be a first-order interneuron of the larval visual system.

Following mobilization of the P element, a screen for variegation of white expression recovered inserts at pericentric, telomeric, and fourth chromosome regions. Previously identified suppressors of PEV suppressed white variegation of pericentric and fourth chromosome inserts but not telomeric inserts on the second and third chromosomes. This implies a difference in the mechanism for gene repression at telomeres. Heat shock-induced hsp26 expression was reduced from pericentric and fourth chromosome inserts but not from telomeric inserts. Chromatin structure analysis revealed that the variegating inserts showed a reduction in accessibility to restriction enzyme digestion in the hsp26 regulatory region in isolated nuclei. Micrococcal nuclease digests showed that pericentric inserts were packaged in a more regular nucleosome array than that observed for euchromatic inserts.

Reciprocal crosses between each of these stocks and D. simulans were made, and the insemination rate at two or three days was examined. From two cycles of screening of the original 575 stocks, one stock (# 687) which showed high insemination rate was selected and was backcrossed to a w strain to substitute the background. We obtained a stock which showed 10% insemination rate with D. simulans males (control was 0%). No stocks exhibiting a high crossability with D. simulans females were acquired. Revertant strains, from which the P element had been lost, were obtained from the backcrossed # 687 stock. The insemination rates of 13 revertants to D. simulans males ranged from 1% to 33%. Seven of these 13 were not significantly different from the control line but were significantly different from the backcrossed # 687 stock. It was concluded that the mutation showing high crossability with D. simulans males was caused by the P element transposition.",1995,"Y Oguma, M Sawa, H Matsubayashi, M Nonaka, M Tomaru, Y Oguma, M Sawa, H Matsubayashi, M Nonaka, M Tomaru"
Structural evolution of the Drosophila 5S ribosomal genes,7490776,10.1007/BF00175820,"We compare the 5S gene structure from nine Drosophila species. New sequence data (5S genes of D. melanogaster, D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, D. yakuba, D. erecta, D. orena, and D. takahashii) and already-published data (5S genes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. teissieri) are used in these comparisons. We show that four regions within the Drosophila 5S genes display distinct rates of evolution: the coding region (120 bp), the 5'-flanking region (54-55 bp), the 3'-flanking region (21-22 bp), and the internal spacer (149-206 bp). Intra- and interspecific heterogeneity is due mainly to insertions and deletions of 6-17-bp oligomers. These small rearrangements could be generated by fork slippages during replication and could produce rapid sequence divergence in a limited number of steps.",1995,"F PÃ¤ques, M L Samson, P Jordan, M Wegnez, F PÃ¤ques, M L Samson, P Jordan, M Wegnez"
Simultaneous overexpression of copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase and catalase retards age-related oxidative damage and increases metabolic potential in Drosophila melanogaster,7797567,10.1074/jbc.270.26.15671,"The objective of this study was to elucidate the nature of the mechanisms by which overexpression of copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and catalase extends life span of Drosophila melanogaster. Experimental flies containing single extra doses of Drosophila Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase genes were compared with appropriate controls at different ages. Overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase caused a retardation in the accumulation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine during aging and in response to the exposure of live flies to x-rays. The age-related loss of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (Glu-6-P dehydrogenase) and the increase in the rate of mitochondrial H2O2 generation were less steep in the experimental than control flies. The rate of in vivo oxygen consumption in the latter two-thirds of life span was higher in the experimental than in the control flies. Furthermore, the metabolic potential, or the total amount of oxygen consumed during an average life span, was about 30% greater in the experimental than the control flies. Altogether, results of this study indicate that overexpression of Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase ameliorates the age-related accumulation of molecular oxidative damage and susceptibility to such damage in response to acute oxidative stress while prolonging the metabolic life of flies. The concept that oxidative stress is a causal factor in the aging process is supported.",1995,"R S Sohal, A Agarwal, S Agarwal, W C Orr, R S Sohal, A Agarwal, S Agarwal, W C Orr"
Pattern formation in Drosophila head development: the role of the orthodenticle homeobox gene,8582270,,"Significant progress has been made towards understanding how pattern formation occurs in the imaginal discs that give rise to the limbs of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we examine the process of regional specification that occurs in the eye-antennal discs, which form the head of the adult fruitfly. We demonstrate genetically that there is a graded requirement for the activity of the orthodenticle homeobox gene in forming specific structures of the developing head. Consistent with this result, we show that OTD protein is expressed in a graded fashion across the disc primordia of these structures and that different threshold levels of OTD are required for the formation of specific subdomains of the head. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that otd acts through the segment polarity gene engrailed to specify medial head development.",1995,"J Royet, R Finkelstein, J Royet, R Finkelstein"
Developmental regulation of membrane protein sorting in Drosophila embryos,7631747,10.1152/ajpcell.1995.269.1.C207,"We have examined the process of membrane protein targeting in the polarized cells of the developing Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-linked protein that accumulates at the apical membranes of mammalian epithelial cells. A chimeric construct composed of the transmembrane and cytosolic portions of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein coupled to the ectodomain of PLAP, termed PLAPG, has been found to behave as a basolateral protein (D. A. Brown, B. Crise, and J. K. Rose. Science Wash. DC 232: 34-47, 1989). The subcellular distributions of these proteins were examined in the epithelial and neuronal tissues of transgenic Drosophila embryos. In the surface ectoderm, both PLAP and PLAPG were restricted to the basolateral membranes throughout development. Internal epithelia derived from the surface ectoderm accumulated PLAP at their apical surfaces, whereas PLAPG retained its basolateral distribution. The redistribution of PLAP from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane was found to be coincident with the invagination of the surface epithelium to form internal structures, suggesting that the sorting pathways that function in the epithelium of the Drosophila embryo are developmentally regulated.",1995,"M J Shiel, M J Caplan, M J Shiel, M J Caplan"
Genotoxicity of two arsenic compounds in germ cells and somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,7607183,10.1002/em.2850250405,"Two arsenic compounds, sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and sodium arsenate (Na2HAsO4), were tested for their possible genotoxicity in germinal and somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. For germinal cells, the sex-linked recessive lethal test (SLRLT) and the sex chromosome loss test (SCLT) were used. In both tests, a brood scheme of 2-3-3 days was employed. Two routes of administration were used for the SLRLT: adult male injection (0.38, 0.77 mM for sodium arsenite; and 0.54, 1.08 mM for sodium arsenate) and larval feeding (0.008, 0.01, 0.02 mM for sodium arsenite; and 0.01, 0.02 mM for sodium arsenate). For the SCLT the compounds were injected into males. Controls were treated with a solution of 5% sucrose which was employed as solvent. The somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) was run in the w+/w eye assay as well as in the mwh +/+ flr3 wing test, employing the standard and insecticide-resistant strains. In both tests, third instar larvae were treated for 6 hr with sodium arsenite (0.38, 0.77, 1.15 mM), and sodium arsenate (0.54, 1.34, 2.69 mM). In the SLRLT, both compounds were positive, but they were negative in the SCLT. The genotoxicity of both compounds was localized mainly in somatic cells, in agreement with reports on the carcinogenic potential of arsenical compounds. Sodium arsenite was an order of magnitude more toxic and mutagenic than sodium arsenate.

An abundantly secreted glycoprotein from Drosophila melanogaster is related to mammalian secretory proteins produced in rheumatoid tissues and by activated macrophages,7875581,10.1016/0378-1119(94)00756-i,"An abundantly secreted 47-kDa glycoprotein, DS47, was purified from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) Schneider line-2 cells, a line exhibiting macrophage-like properties. DS47 is also secreted from several Dm cell lines resembling S2 but not from lines that are morphologically distinct. A cDNA cline was isolated from an S2 cell cDNA library using oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes based on the DS47 amino acid (aa) sequence and found to encode a novel secretory glycoprotein of 452 aa. Analysis of DS47 protein production and mRNA expression during fly development indicates that both are present throughout the entire Dm life cycle, suggesting that DS47 may be important at all developmental stages. In larvae, the DS47 message is made in the fat body and by hemocytes, and secreted into the hemolymph. DS47 is related to a human cartilage glycoprotein, HC gp-39, that is secreted from cell types associated with the arthritic joint, such as synovial cells and activated macrophages. Interestingly, the HC gp-39 message is most readily detected in the human liver, an organ that is somewhat analogous to the Dm fat body. DS47 also shares homology to a mouse secretory glycoprotein, YM-1, identified in activated macrophages. These homologies extend to the chitinase gene family and include a conserved cysteine aa motif, as well as two blocks of aa within the enzymatic active site, although neither DS-47 nor HC gp-39 exhibit chitinase activity. Potential functions of this conserved protein family are discussed.",1995,"R B Kirkpatrick, R E Matico, D E McNulty, J E Strickler, M Rosenberg, R B Kirkpatrick, R E Matico, D E McNulty, J E Strickler, M Rosenberg"
Period protein from the giant silkmoth Antheraea pernyi functions as a circadian clock element in Drosophila melanogaster,7619519,10.1016/0896-6273(95)90072-1,"Homologs of the Drosophila clock gene per have recently been cloned in Lepidopteran and Blattarian insect species. To assess the extent to which clock mechanisms are conserved among phylogenetically distant species, we determined whether PER protein from the silkmoth Antheraea pernyi can function in the Drosophila circadian timing system. When expressed in transgenic Drosophila, the silkmoth PER protein is detected in the expected neural cell types, with diurnal changes in abundance that are similar to those observed in wild-type fruitflies. Behavioral analysis demonstrates that the silkmoth protein can serve as a molecular element of the Drosophila clock system; expression of the protein shortens circadian period in a dose-dependent manner and restores pacemaker functions to arrhythmic per0 mutants. This comparative study also suggests that the involvement of PER in different aspects of circadian timing, such as period determination, strength of rhythmicity, and clock out-put, requires distinct molecular interactions.",1995,"J D Levine, I Sauman, M Imbalzano, S M Reppert, F R Jackson, J D Levine, I Sauman, M Imbalzano, S M Reppert, F R Jackson"

This scheme, also verified by the Micro-Complement Fixation (MC'F) method in another study in our Laboratory, substantiates the connection between the enzyme function and the phylogeny of these species. We propose that the major variation of the Ldh gene in this subgroup has arisen prior to the first species divergence, the final result of which is the eight sibling species.

We established an in vivo model to determine the host factors that control pathogenesis and identified viral entry as a rate-limiting step for infection. We infected Drosophila melanogaster cells and adults with drosophila C virus and found that the clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway is essential for both infection and pathogenesis. Heterozygosity for mutations in genes involved in endocytosis is sufficient to protect flies from pathogenicity, indicating the exquisite sensitivity and dependency of the virus on this pathway.

Expression of the Drosophila melanogaster S3 ribosomal/repair protein in T24 human bladder cells,15736416,,"Repair of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) is inefficient in human cells due to the poor catalytic properties of hOGG1, the major DNA glycosylase involved in the removal of this oxidized base. The S3 ribosomal/repair protein from Drosophila melanogaster (dS3) is endowed with a potent 8-oxoG glycolytic activity coupled with a beta, delta-AP lyase. In vitro repair experiments have shown that pure GST-tagged dS3 can stimulate a > 40-fold increase in the rate of 8-oxoG repair by human cell extracts. In this study, we expressed dS3 fused to the Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) in T24 human bladder cells in order to accelerate the repair of 8-oxoG in vivo. Limiting dilution and Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) were used in an effort to isolate cells with elevated EGFP-dS3 expression; however, the cells that were isolated invariably had severe growth impairment. Curiously, EGFP-dS3 expression was slightly increased after recovering cells from liquid nitrogen, but it was not possible under those conditions to achieve a significant acceleration of 8-oxoG repair. The data confirm and extend our previous results obtained with Chinese hamster CHO cells and indicate that elevated expression of dS3 may be toxic to at least some types of mammalian cells, thus limiting its use in vivo as a protective factor against oxidative DNA damage.",2004,"Monica Ropolo, Alessandro Geroldi, Ottavio Rossi, Paolo Degan, Simona Zupo, Alessandro Poggi, Guido Frosina, Monica Ropolo, Alessandro Geroldi, Ottavio Rossi, Paolo Degan, Simona Zupo, Alessandro Poggi, Guido Frosina"

"A single-amino-acid change of the gustatory receptor gene, Gr5a, has a major effect on trehalose sensitivity in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster",15342513,10.1534/genetics.104.027045,"Variation in trehalose sensitivity and nucleotide sequence polymorphism of the Gr5a gene encoding the gustatory receptor to sugar trehalose were investigated in 152 male lines of Drosophila melanogaster collected from a natural population. Among the observed 59 segregating sites, some pairs of sites showed significant linkage disequilibrium. A single SNP, which results in the Ala218Thr amino acid change, was significantly associated with trehalose sensitivity, as previously suggested. Threonine at amino acid position 218 was found to be the ancestral form in D. melanogaster, suggesting that low trehalose sensitivity was an ancestral form with respect to the receptor function. There was large genetic variation in trehalose sensitivity. It was continuously distributed, indicating that trehalose sensitivity measured by the behavioral assay is a quantitative trait. These results suggest that apart from the Gr5a gene, other genetic factors contribute to variation in trehalose sensitivity. Nucleotide diversity (pi) and nucleotide variation (theta) per site were 0.00874 and 0.00590, respectively. Fu and Li's test and the MK test showed no significant departure from the expectation of selective neutrality in the Gr5a gene.

Do quantitative trait loci (QTL) for a courtship song difference between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia coincide with candidate genes and intraspecific QTL?,15082549,10.1534/genetics.166.3.1303,"The genetic architecture of traits influencing sexual isolation can give insight into the evolution of reproductive isolation and hence speciation. Here we report a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of the difference in mean interpulse interval (IPI), an important component of the male courtship song, between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia. Using a backcross analysis, we find six QTL that explain a total of 40.7% of the phenotypic variance. Three candidate genes are located in the intervals bounded by two of the QTL and there are no significant QTL on the X chromosome. The values of mean IPI for hybrid individuals imply the presence of dominant alleles or epistasis. Because unisexual hybrid sterility prevents an F(2) analysis, we cannot distinguish dominant from additive genetic effects at the scale of QTL. A comparison with a study of QTL for intraspecific variation in D. melanogaster shows that, for these strains, the QTL we have identified for interspecific variation cannot be those that contribute to intraspecific variation. We find that the QTL have bidirectional effects, which indicates that the genetic architecture is compatible with divergence due to genetic drift, although other possibilities are discussed.",2004,"Jennifer M Gleason, Michael G Ritchie, Jennifer M Gleason, Michael G Ritchie"

IR induces MNK/Chk2-dependent phosphorylation of p53 without changing p53 protein levels, indicating that p53 activity can be regulated without an Mdm2-like activity. In a genome-wide analysis of IR-induced transcription in wild-type and mutant embryos, all IR-induced increases in transcript levels required both p53 and the Drosophila Chk2 homolog MNK. Proapoptotic targets of p53 include hid, reaper, sickle, and the tumor necrosis factor family member EIGER: Overexpression of Eiger is sufficient to induce apoptosis, but mutations in Eiger do not block IR-induced apoptosis. Animals heterozygous for deletions that span the reaper, sickle, and hid genes exhibited reduced IR-dependent apoptosis, indicating that this gene complex is haploinsufficient for induction of apoptosis.

Insect odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are thought to function as the first step in molecular recognition and the transport of semiochemicals. The whole genome sequence of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been completed and a large number of genes have been annotated as OBPs, based on the presence of six conserved cysteine residues and a conserved spacing between the cysteines. These proteins can be divided into three distinct subgroups; those with only one six-cysteine motif, those with two such motifs and those with one motif, three extra conserved cysteines and a conserved proline immediately after the sixth cysteine. This study concentrates on the last two subgroups, referred to as 'dimer' OBPs and 'Plus-C' OBPs, respectively. We determined the tissue-specific transcript levels of all of these OBP genes of D. melanogaster using semiquantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression patterns can vary within a subgroup of genes and that this technique is valuable for assessing which of the putative OBP genes are likely to be involved in Drosophila olfaction.

Accumulation of transposable elements in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster is associated with a decrease in fitness,15247307,10.1093/jhered/esh050,"Replicates of the two isogenic laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster, 2b and Harwich, contain different average transposable element (TE) copy numbers in the same genetic background. These lines were used to analyze the correlation between TE copy number and fitness. Assuming a weak deleterious effect of each TE insertion, a decrease in fitness is expected with an increase in genomic TE copy number. Higher rates of ectopic exchanges and, consequently, chromosomal rearrangements resulting in early embryonic death are also predicted from an increase in TE copy number. Therefore egg hatchability is expected to decrease as the genomic TE copy number increases. In 2b, where replicate lines have diverged up by 90 TE copies per haploid genome, a negative correlation between the number of TE insertions and both fitness and egg hatchability were found. Neither correlation was significant for the Harwich replicates, which have only diverged by 30 TE copies.

The S6KII (rsk) gene of Drosophila melanogaster differentially affects an operant and a classical learning task,15525759,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3211-04.2004,"In an attempt to dissect classical and operant conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster, we have isolated the gene for ribosomal S6 kinase II (S6KII). This enzyme is part of a family of serine-threonine kinases that in mammals have been implicated in the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling cascade controlling (among other processes) synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation/long-term depression) and memory formation. The human homolog rsk2 has been linked to mental retardation (Coffin-Lowry syndrome). Mutant analysis in Drosophila shows that S6KII serves different functions in operant place learning and classical (pavlovian) olfactory conditioning. Whereas in the null mutant only pavlovian olfactory learning is affected, a P-element insertion mutant reducing the amount of S6KII only affects operant place learning. A mutant lacking part of the N-terminal kinase domain and performing poorly in both learning tasks is dominant in the operant paradigm and recessive in the pavlovian paradigm. The behavioral defects in the pavlovian task can be rescued by the genomic S6KII transgene.

A gene expression map for the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster,15499012,10.1126/science.1101312,"We used a maskless photolithography method to produce DNA oligonucleotide microarrays with unique probe sequences tiled throughout the genome of Drosophila melanogaster and across predicted splice junctions. RNA expression of protein coding and nonprotein coding sequences was determined for each major stage of the life cycle, including adult males and females. We detected transcriptional activity for 93% of annotated genes and RNA expression for 41% of the probes in intronic and intergenic sequences. Comparison to genome-wide RNA interference data and to gene annotations revealed distinguishable levels of expression for different classes of genes and higher levels of expression for genes with essential cellular functions. Differential splicing was observed in about 40% of predicted genes, and 5440 previously unknown splice forms were detected. Genes within conserved regions of synteny with D. pseudoobscura had highly correlated expression; these regions ranged in length from 10 to 900 kilobase pairs. The expressed intergenic and intronic sequences are more likely to be evolutionarily conserved than nonexpressed ones, and about 15% of them appear to be developmentally regulated.

Genetic and bioinformatic analysis of 41C and the 2R heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster: a window on the heterochromatin-euchromatin junction,15020470,10.1534/genetics.166.2.807,"Genomic sequences provide powerful new tools in genetic analysis, making it possible to combine classical genetics with genomics to characterize the genes in a particular chromosome region. These approaches have been applied successfully to the euchromatin, but analysis of the heterochromatin has lagged somewhat behind. We describe a combined genetic and bioinformatics approach to the base of the right arm of the Drosophila melanogaster second chromosome, at the boundary between pericentric heterochromatin and euchromatin. We used resources provided by the genome project to derive a physical map of the region, examine gene density, and estimate the number of potential genes. We also carried out a large-scale genetic screen for lethal mutations in the region. We identified new alleles of the known essential genes and also identified mutations in 21 novel loci. Fourteen complementation groups map proximal to the assembled sequence. We used PCR to map the endpoints of several deficiencies and used the same set of deficiencies to order the essential genes, correlating the genetic and physical map.

Isolation from the horse genome of a new DNA transposon belonging to the Tigger family,15170229,10.1007/s00335-004-3040-6,Tigger elements are human DNA transposons homologous to the pogo element of Drosophila melanogaster. They contain an open reading frame for a transposase very similar to the major mammalian centromere protein CENP-B. We found in the horse genome a DNA element ( Ecatig3) sharing 88% homology with human Tigger3. The presence of Tigger elements in the horse genome confirms previous data that date these elements before the divergence between Perissodactyla and Primates (80-90 Myr ago). Copy number evaluation indicates that the horse element is much more abundant than its human counterpart. Southern blot analysis demonstrates that Ecatig3 elements are extremely homogeneous; this may indicate that the evolution of this DNA transposon has been driven by some kind of selection and has not been neutral.,2004,"Marianna Paulis, Daniela Moralli, Mirella Bensi, Luigi De Carli, Elena Raimondi, Marianna Paulis, Daniela Moralli, Mirella Bensi, Luigi De Carli, Elena Raimondi"
Architectural arrangement of cloned proximal sequence element-binding protein subunits on Drosophila U1 and U6 snRNA gene promoters,14966271,10.1128/mcb.24.5.1897-1906.2004,"Transcription of snRNA genes by either RNA polymerase II (U1 to U5) or RNA polymerase III (U6) is dependent upon a proximal sequence element (PSE) located approximately 40 to 60 bp upstream of the transcription start site. In Drosophila melanogaster, RNA polymerase specificity is determined by as few as three nucleotide differences within the otherwise well-conserved 21-bp PSE. Previous photo-cross-linking studies revealed that the D. melanogaster PSE-binding protein, DmPBP, contains three subunits (DmPBP45, DmPBP49, and DmPBP95) that associate with the DNA to form complexes that are conformationally distinct depending upon whether the protein is bound to a U1 or a U6 PSE. We have identified and cloned the genes that code for these subunits of DmPBP by virtue of their similarity to three of the five subunits of SNAP(c), the human PBP. When expressed in S2 cells, each of the three cloned gene products is incorporated into a protein complex that functionally binds to a PSE. We also find that the conformational difference referred to above is particularly pronounced for DmPBP45, herein identified as the ortholog of human SNAP43. DmPBP45 cross-linked strongly to DNA for two turns of the DNA helix downstream of the U1 PSE, but it cross-linked strongly for only a half turn of the helix downstream of a U6 PSE. These substantial differences in the cross-linking pattern are consistent with those of a model in which conformational differences in DmPBP-DNA complexes lead to selective RNA polymerase recruitment to U1 and U6 promoters.",2004,"Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph, Cheng Li, Gale A Harding, Jason Parise, Kathleen J McNamara-Schroeder, William E Stumph"

Instead, two families of non-LTR retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART, maintain telomere length by occasional transposition to the chromosome ends. Despite the work on Drosophila telomeres, its evolutionary origin remains controversial. Herein we describe a novel telomere-specific retroelement that we name TAHRE (Telomere-Associated and HeT-A-Related Element). The structure of the three telomere-specific elements indicates a common ancestor.

Effect of breeding structure on population genetic parameters in Drosophila,15020467,10.1534/genetics.166.2.779,"The breeding structure of populations has been neglected in studies of Drosophila, even though Wright and Dobzhansky's pioneering work on the genetics of natural populations was an attempt to tackle what they regarded as an essential factor in evolution. We compared the breeding structure of sympatric populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, two sibling species that are widely used in evolutionary studies. We recorded changes in population density and microsatellite variation patterns for 3 years in a temperate environment of southwestern France. Results were distinctively different in the two species. Maximum population levels in summer and in autumn were similar and fluctuated greatly over years, each species being in turn the most abundant. However, genetic data showed that D. melanogaster made up a continuous breeding population in time and space of practically infinite effective size. D. simulans was fragmented into isolates with a local effective size of between 50 and 350 individuals. A consequence of this was that, while a local sample provided a reliable estimate of regional genetic variability in D. melanogaster, a sample from the same area provided an underestimate of this parameter in D. simulans. In practical terms, this means that variations in breeding structure should be accounted for in sampling schemes and in designing evolutionary genetic models. More generally, this suggests the existence of differential reactions to local environments that might contribute to several genomic differences observed between these species.",2004,"Emmanuelle Gravot, MichÃ¨le Huet, Michel Veuille, Emmanuelle Gravot, MichÃ¨le Huet, Michel Veuille"

The study complements earlier work designed to systematically identify vital genes on the X chromosome by targeting transcription units which are phenotypically silent. We describe single UAS sequence-bearing P-element insertions throughout the X chromosome, which allows one to express the tagged genes under control of tissue/organ-directed GAL4 activity.

Evolution of the larval peripheral nervous system in Drosophila species has involved a change in sensory cell lineage,15293048,10.1007/s00427-004-0422-4,"A key challenge in evolutionary biology is to identify developmental events responsible for morphological changes. To determine the cellular basis that underlies changes in the larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) of flies, we first described the PNS pattern of the abdominal segments A1-A7 in late embryos of several fly species using antibody staining. In contrast to the many variations reported previously for the adult PNS pattern, we found that the larval PNS pattern has remained very stable during evolution. Indeed, our observation that most of the analysed Drosophilinae species exhibit exactly the same pattern as Drosophila melanogaster reveals that the pattern observed in D. melanogaster embryos has remained constant for at least 40 million years. Furthermore, we observed that the PNS pattern in more distantly related flies (Calliphoridae and Phoridae) is only slightly different from the one in D. melanogaster. A single difference relative to D. melanogaster was identified in the PNS pattern of the Drosophilinae fly D. busckii, the absence of a specific external sensory organ. Our analysis of sensory organ development in D. busckii suggests that this specific loss resulted from a transformation in cell lineage, from a multidendritic-neuron-external-sensory-organ lineage to a multidendritic-neuron-solo lineage.",2004,"Virginie Orgogozo, FranÃ§ois Schweisguth, Virginie Orgogozo, FranÃ§ois Schweisguth"

We have characterized three independent events in which a 14-kb fragment from the w(67C23) locus was transposed into an intron region in three different genes.

"Molecular mechanisms of DrICE inhibition by DIAP1 and removal of inhibition by Reaper, Hid and Grim",15107838,10.1038/nsmb764,"The Drosophila melanogaster inhibitor of apoptosis protein DIAP1 suppresses apoptosis in part through inhibition of the effector caspase DrICE. The pro-death proteins Reaper, Hid and Grim (RHG) induce apoptosis by antagonizing DIAP1 function. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that DIAP1 directly inhibits the catalytic activity of DrICE through its BIR1 domain and this inhibition is countered effectively by the RHG proteins. Inhibition of DrICE by DIAP1 occurs only after the cleavage of its N-terminal 20 amino acids and involves a conserved surface groove on BIR1. Crystal structures of BIR1 bound to the RHG peptides show that the RHG proteins use their N-terminal IAP-binding motifs to bind to the same surface groove, hence relieving DIAP1-mediated inhibition of DrICE.

Variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects in novel versus familiar environments in two Drosophila species,15536257,10.1007/BF02729895,"Models of competitor coevolution, especially the genetic feedback hypothesis, suggest that a negative correlation between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects may be important in sustaining competitor coexistence, and can give rise to oscillatory dynamics with repeated reversals of competitive superiority. I reanalyzed previously published census data from an experiment in which populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans underwent competitive coevolution in one familiar and two novel environments, to specifically look for any evidence of a negative relationship between intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates, and for any indication of short period cycling in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects. While there was considerable variation in the relative magnitude of intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects over generations, among both populations and environments, there was no clear evidence supporting the genetic feedback hypothesis. Intraspecific and interspecific competitive effects on population growth rates were strongly positively correlated in novel environments, and uncorrelated in the familiar environment. Data from the familiar environment indicated that indices of competition of populations of the initially superior competitor, D. melanogaster, might be showing some cyclic behaviour, but I argue that this is likely to be transient, and not suggestive of sustained oscillatory dynamics predicted by the genetic feedback model. I discuss the results in the context of the importance of the genetic architecture of intraspecific and interspecific competitive abilities in determining the coevolutionary trajectory of competitive interactions.",2004,"Amitabh Joshi, Amitabh Joshi"
Strong selective sweep associated with a transposon insertion in Drosophila simulans,14745026,10.1073/pnas.0303793101,"We know little about several important properties of beneficial mutations, including their mutational origin, their phenotypic effects (e.g., protein structure changes vs. regulatory changes), and the frequency and rapidity with which they become fixed in a population. One signature of the spread of beneficial mutations is the reduction of heterozygosity at linked sites. Here, we present population genetic data from several loci across chromosome arm 2R in Drosophila simulans. A 100-kb segment from a freely recombining region of this chromosome shows extremely reduced heterozygosity in a California population sample, yet typical levels of divergence between species, suggesting that at least one episode of strong directional selection has occurred in the region. The 5' flanking sequence of one gene in this region, Cyp6g1 (a cytochrome P450), is nearly fixed for a Doc transposable element insertion. Presence of the insertion is correlated with increased transcript abundance of Cyp6g1, a phenotype previously shown to be associated with insecticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. Surveys of nucleotide variation in the same genomic region in an African D. simulans population revealed no evidence for a high-frequency Doc element and no evidence for reduced polymorphism. These data are consistent with the notion that the Doc element is a geographically restricted beneficial mutation.

Biotin deficiency decreases life span and fertility but increases stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,15542350,10.1016/j.jnutbio.2004.04.006,"Biotin deficiency is associated with fetal malformations and activation of cell survival pathways in mammals. In this study we determined whether biotin status affects life span, stress resistance, and fertility in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Male and female flies of the Canton-S strain had free access to diets containing 6.0 (control), 4.8, 2.5, or 0 pmol biotin/100 mg. Biotin concentrations in diets correlated with activities of biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase and biotin concentrations in fly homogenates, but not with biotinylation of histones (DNA-binding proteins). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase activities and biotin concentrations were lower in males than in females fed diets low in biotin. The life span of biotin-deficient males and females was up to 30% shorter compared to biotin-sufficient controls. Exposure to oxidative stress reversed the effects of biotin status on survival in male flies: survival times increased by 40% in biotin-deficient males compared to biotin-sufficient controls. Biotin status did not affect survival of females exposed to oxidative stress. Exposure of flies to cold, heat, and oxidative stress was associated with mobilization of biotin from yet unknown sources. Biotin deficiency decreased fertility of flies. When biotin-deficient males and females were mated, the hatching rate (larvae hatched per egg) decreased by about 28% compared to biotin-sufficient controls.

Immunoblot using anti-phospho amino acid antibodies reveals the enzyme is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine. The purified native enzyme exhibits a V(max) value of 1352+/-159 nmol CDP-choline/min/mg, a K(m) value of 0.50+/-0.09 mM for phosphocholine, and a K' (Hill constant) value of 0.72+/-0.10 mM for CTP.

Rapid evolution of piRNA-mediated silencing of an invading transposable element was driven by abundant de novo mutations,32238416,10.1101/gr.251546.119,"The regulation of transposable element (TE) activity by small RNAs is a ubiquitous feature of germlines. However, despite the obvious benefits to the host in terms of ensuring the production of viable gametes and maintaining the integrity of the genomes they carry, it remains controversial whether TE regulation evolves adaptively. We examined the emergence and evolutionary dynamics of repressor alleles after P-elements invaded the Drosophila melanogaster genome in the mid-twentieth century. In many animals including Drosophila, repressor alleles are produced by transpositional insertions into piRNA clusters, genomic regions encoding the Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that regulate TEs. We discovered that ??4% of recently collected isofemale lines in the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) contain at least one P-element insertion in a piRNA cluster, indicating that repressor alleles are produced by de novo insertion at an exceptional rate. Furthermore, in our sample of approximately 200 genomes, we uncovered no fewer than 80 unique P-element insertion alleles in at least 15 different piRNA clusters. Finally, we observe no footprint of positive selection on P-element insertions in piRNA clusters, suggesting that the rapid evolution of piRNA-mediated repression in D. melanogaster was driven primarily by mutation. Our results reveal for the first time how the unique genetic architecture of piRNA production, in which numerous piRNA clusters can encode regulatory small RNAs upon transpositional insertion, facilitates the nonadaptive rapid evolution of repression.",2020,"Shuo Zhang, Beverly Pointer, Erin S Kelleher, Shuo Zhang, Beverly Pointer, Erin S Kelleher"

Host searching and host preference of resident pupal parasitoids of Drosophila suzukii in the invaded regions,32687647,10.1002/ps.6013,"Background:
      
    

    
      In its invaded regions, Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) is a novel host for the community of resident parasitoids of Drosophila. To attain a high parasitization rate on the novel host, the parasitoids have to locate it and accept it in the presence of other Drosophila hosts. We conducted a laboratory choice experiment and a semifield trial to investigate host searching and host preference of the three pupal parasitoid species Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins), Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae (Rondani) and Spalangia erythromera FÃ¶rster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      All three parasitoid species preferred D. suzukii over two common native hosts in the choice experiment. In field cages, most parasitoid offspring emerged from D. suzukii hosts.

Drosophila histone locus body assembly and function involves multiple interactions,32401666,10.1091/mbc.E20-03-0176,"The histone locus body (HLB) assembles at replication-dependent (RD) histone loci and concentrates factors required for RD histone mRNA biosynthesis. The Drosophila melanogaster genome has a single locus comprised of ??00 copies of a tandemly arrayed 5-kB repeat unit containing one copy of each of the 5 RD histone genes. To determine sequence elements required for D. melanogaster HLB formation and histone gene expression, we used transgenic gene arrays containing 12 copies of the histone repeat unit that functionally complement loss of the ??00 endogenous RD histone genes. A 12x histone gene array in which all H3-H4 promoters were replaced with H2a-H2b promoters (12xPR) does not form an HLB or express high levels of RD histone mRNA in the presence of the endogenous histone genes. In contrast, this same transgenic array is active in HLB assembly and RD histone gene expression in the absence of the endogenous RD histone genes and rescues the lethality caused by homozygous deletion of the RD histone locus. The HLB formed in the absence of endogenous RD histone genes on the mutant 12x array contains all known factors present in the wild-type HLB including CLAMP, which normally binds to GAGA repeats in the H3-H4 promoter. These data suggest that multiple protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions contribute to HLB formation, and that the large number of endogenous RD histone gene copies sequester available factor(s) from attenuated transgenic arrays, thereby preventing HLB formation and gene expression on these arrays.",2020,"Kaitlin P Koreski, Leila E Rieder, Lyndsey M McLain, Ashlesha Chaubal, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio, Kaitlin P Koreski, Leila E Rieder, Lyndsey M McLain, Ashlesha Chaubal, William F Marzluff, Robert J Duronio"

We report that Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted during 160 generations of experimental evolution to chronic larval malnutrition became more susceptible to intestinal infection with the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila. However, they do not show suppressed immune response or higher bacterial loads. Rather, their increased susceptibility to P. entomophila is largely mediated by an elevated predisposition to loss of intestinal barrier integrity upon infection.

We hypothesized that the fru gene of D. subobscura but not that of D. melanogaster contains a cis element that directs the formation of the additional pair of MOLs. Successively extended 5' DNA fragments to the P1 promoter of D. subobscura or the corresponding fragments that are chimeric (i.e., containing both melanogaster and subobscura elements) were introduced into D. melanogaster and tested for their ability to induce the MOL to locate the hypothetical cis element. We found that a 1.5-2-kb genomic fragment located 4-6-kb upstream of the P1 promoter in D. subobscura but not that of D. melanogaster permits MOL formation in females, provided this fragment is grafted to the distal ??-kb segment from D. melanogaster, demonstrating that this genomic fragment of D. subobscura contains a cis element for the MOL induction.",2015,"Sakino Takayanagi, Gakuta Toba, Tamas Lukacsovich, Manabu Ote, Kosei Sato, Daisuke Yamamoto"
Molecular evolution of candidate genes involved in post-mating-prezygotic reproductive isolation,25522894,10.1111/jeb.12574,"Traits involved in post-copulatory interactions between the sexes may evolve rapidly as a result of sexual selection and/or sexual conflict, leading to post-mating-prezygotic (PMPZ) reproductive isolating barriers between diverging lineages. Although the importance of PMPZ isolation is recognized, the molecular basis of such incompatibilities is not well understood. Here, we investigate molecular evolution of a subset of Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila arizonae reproductive tract genes. These include genes that are transcriptionally regulated by conspecific mating in females, many of which are misregulated in heterospecific crosses, and a set of male genes whose transcripts are transferred to females during mating. As a group, misregulated female genes are not more divergent and do not appear to evolve under different selection pressures than other female reproductive genes. Male transferred genes evolve at a higher rate than testis-expressed genes, and at a similar rate compared to accessory gland protein genes, which are known to evolve rapidly. Four of the individual male transferred genes show patterns of divergent positive selection between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae. Three of the four genes belong to the sperm-coating protein-like family, including an ortholog of antares, which influences female fertility and receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster. Synthesis of these molecular evolutionary analyses with transcriptomics and predicted functional information makes these genes candidates for involvement in PMPZ reproductive incompatibilities between D. mojavensis and D. arizonae.",2015,"J M Bono, L M Matzkin, K Hoang, L Brandsmeier, J M Bono, L M Matzkin, K Hoang, L Brandsmeier"
The peculiarities of piRNA expression upon heat shock exposure in Drosophila melanogaster,26904377,10.1080/2159256X.2015.1086502,"Different types of stress including heat shock may induce genomic instability, due to the derepression and amplification of mobile elements (MEs). It remains unclear, however, whether piRNA-machinery regulating ME expression functions normally under stressful conditions. The aim of this study was to explore the features of piRNA expression after heat shock (HS) exposure in Drosophila melanogaster. We also evaluated functioning of piRNA-machinery in the absence of major stress protein Hsp70 in this species. We analyzed the deep sequence data of piRNA expression after HS treatment and demonstrated that it modulates the expression of certain double-stranded germinal piRNA-clusters. Notable, we demonstrated significant changes in piRNA levels targeting a group of MEs after HS only in the strain containing normal set of hsp70 genes. Surprisingly, we failed to detect any correlation between the levels of piRNAs and the transcription of complementary MEs in the studied strains. We propose that modulation of certain piRNA-clusters expression upon HS exposure in D. melanogaster occurs due to HS-induced altering of chromatin state at certain chromosome regions.",2015,"S Yu Funikov, S S Ryazansky, E S Zelentsova, V I Popenko, O G Leonova, D G Garbuz, M B Evgen'ev, O G Zatsepina, S Yu Funikov, S S Ryazansky, E S Zelentsova, V I Popenko, O G Leonova, D G Garbuz, M B Evgen'ev, O G Zatsepina"
Coping with Space Neophobia in Drosophila melanogaster: The Asymmetric Dynamics of Crossing a Doorway to the Untrodden,26646394,10.1371/journal.pone.0140207,"We discover and examine within a wide phylogenetic perspective spatial neophobia, avoidance of untrodden terrain, in fruit flies, in an experimental setup that reduces the gap between the field and the laboratory. In our setup, fruit flies use a natal fruit as their origin, freely exploring for days their surroundings, which consists of a mixture of trodden and untrodden terrain. The interface between trodden and untrodden is, however, reduced in our setup to a wide doorway, opened within a surrounding wall. Crossing this doorway, characterized by a sharp contrast interface between trodden and untrodden, generates a behavior whose dynamics betrays the flies' space neophobia. The moment-by-moment dynamics of crossing is remarkably similar to that reported in mouse models of anxiety. This means that neophobic behavior is either homologous across arthropods and vertebrates or, not less interesting, convergent, whereby the same behavior is mediated in the two phyla by two completely different schemata.",2015,"Shay Cohen, Yoav Benjamini, Ilan Golani, Shay Cohen, Yoav Benjamini, Ilan Golani"
The commonly used eye-specific sev-GAL4 and GMR-GAL4 drivers in Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in tissues other than eyes also,26440079,10.1007/s12041-015-0535-8,"The binary GAL4-UAS system of conditional gene expression is widely used by Drosophila geneticists to target expression of the desired transgene in tissue of interest. In many studies, a preferred target tissue is the Drosophila eye, for which the sev-GAL4 and GMR-GAL4 drivers are most widely used since they are believed to be expressed exclusively in the developing eye cells. However, several reports have noted lethality following expression of certain transgenes under these GAL4 drivers notwithstanding the fact that eye is not essential for survival of the fly. Therefore, to explore the possibility that these drivers may also be active in tissues other than eye, we examined the expression of UAS-GFP reporter driven by the sev-GAL4 or GMR-GAL4 drivers. We found that both these drivers are indeed expressed in additional tissues, including a common set of specific neuronal cells in larval and pupal ventral and cerebral ganglia. Neither sev nor glass gene has so far been reported to be expressed in these neuronal cells. Expression pattern of sev-GAL4 driver parallels that of the endogenous Sevenless protein. In addition to cells in which sev-GAL4 is expressed, the GMR-GAL4 is expressed in several other larval cell types also. Further, two different GMR-GAL4 lines also show some specific differences in their expression domains outside the eye discs. These findings emphasize the need for a careful confirmation of the expression domains of a GAL4 driver being used in a given study, rather than relying only on the empirically claimed expression domains.",2015,"Mukulika Ray, Subhash C Lakhotia, Mukulika Ray, Subhash C Lakhotia"

Effects of atrazine exposure on male reproductive performance in Drosophila melanogaster,25445663,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.11.002,"Atrazine is a commonly utilized herbicide to control broadleaf weeds in the agricultural setting. It can, however, have negative effects on male reproductive performance in a variety of vertebrate species. Much less is known, however, about the effects of atrazine on invertebrates. In this study, we investigated the effects of several different concentrations of larval atrazine exposure on measures of reproductive performance in adult male Drosophila melanogaster. Atrazine exposure had significant effects on a male's mating ability and the number of eggs his partner laid when he was successful at mating. Exposed males also sired a smaller proportion of the offspring under competitive conditions when they were the first male to mate to a doubly mated female. Atrazine exposure had no measurable effect on a male's ability to prevent a mated female from mating to another male or on the proportion of offspring sired when the exposed males were the second male to mate. Exposure upregulated expression of one male reproductive gene, ovulin, but had no effect on expression of another, sex peptide. Exposed males produced and transferred more sex peptide protein to the female during mating but ovulin protein levels were not affected. In general, we observed non-monotonic responses such that the intermediate exposure levels showed the largest reduction in male reproductive performance. This study suggests that atrazine exposure affects male reproductive performance in insects and future studies should aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the fitness effects of exposure.",2015,"Andrea Vogel, Harper Jocque, Laura K Sirot, Anthony C Fiumera, Andrea Vogel, Harper Jocque, Laura K Sirot, Anthony C Fiumera"

Multicellular organisms have different types of cells that possess distinct composition, morphology, and organization of intracellular organelles.

Interactions between Drosophila and its natural yeast symbionts-Is Saccharomyces cerevisiae a good model for studying the fly-yeast relationship?,26336636,10.7717/peerj.1116,"Yeasts play an important role in the biology of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In addition to being a valuable source of nutrition, yeasts affect D. melanogaster behavior and interact with the host immune system. Most experiments investigating the role of yeasts in D. melanogaster biology use the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, S. cerevisiae is rarely found with natural populations of D. melanogaster or other Drosophila species. Moreover, the strain of S. cerevisiae used most often in D. melanogaster experiments is a commercially and industrially important strain that, to the best of our knowledge, was not isolated from flies. Since disrupting natural host-microbe interactions can have profound effects on host biology, the results from D. melanogaster-S. cerevisiae laboratory experiments may not be fully representative of host-microbe interactions in nature. In this study, we explore the D. melanogaster-yeast relationship using five different strains of yeast that were isolated from wild Drosophila populations. Ingested live yeasts have variable persistence in the D. melanogaster gastrointestinal tract. For example, Hanseniaspora occidentalis persists relative to S. cerevisiae, while Brettanomyces naardenensis is removed. Despite these differences in persistence relative to S. cerevisiae, we find that all yeasts decrease in total abundance over time. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an important component of the D. melanogaster anti-microbial response and can inhibit S. cerevisiae growth in the intestine. To determine if sensitivity to ROS explains the differences in yeast persistence, we measured yeast growth in the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide. We find that B. naardenesis is completely inhibited by hydrogen peroxide, while H. occidentalis is not, which is consistent with yeast sensitivity to ROS affecting persistence within the D. melanogaster gastrointestinal tract. We also compared the feeding preference of D. melanogaster when given the choice between a naturally associated yeast and S. cerevisiae. We do not find a correlation between preferred yeasts and those that persist in the intestine. Notably, in no instances is S. cerevisiae preferred over the naturally associated strains. Overall, our results show that D. melanogaster-yeast interactions are more complex than might be revealed in experiments that use only S. cerevisiae. We propose that future research utilize other yeasts, and especially those that are naturally associated with Drosophila, to more fully understand the role of yeasts in Drosophila biology. Since the genetic basis of host-microbe interactions is shared across taxa and since many of these genes are initially discovered in D. melanogaster, a more realistic fly-yeast model system will benefit our understanding of host-microbe interactions throughout the animal kingdom.",2015,"Don Hoang, Artyom Kopp, James Angus Chandler"
Vesicle-Mediated Steroid Hormone Secretion in Drosophila melanogaster,26544939,10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.022,"Steroid hormones are a large family of cholesterol derivatives regulating development and physiology in both the animal and plant kingdoms, but little is known concerning mechanisms of their secretion from steroidogenic tissues. Here, we present evidence that in Drosophila, endocrine release of the steroid hormone ecdysone is mediated through a regulated vesicular trafficking mechanism. Inhibition of calcium signaling in the steroidogenic prothoracic gland results in the accumulation of unreleased ecdysone, and the knockdown of calcium-mediated vesicle exocytosis components in the gland caused developmental defects due to deficiency of ecdysone. Accumulation of synaptotagmin-labeled vesicles in the gland is observed when calcium signaling is disrupted, and these vesicles contain an ABC transporter that functions as an ecdysone pump to fill vesicles. We propose that trafficking of steroid hormones out of endocrine cells is not always through a simple diffusion mechanism as presently thought, but instead can involve a regulated vesicle-mediated release process.",2015,"Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo MarquÃ©s, Michael B O'Connor, Naoki Yamanaka, Guillermo MarquÃ©s, Michael B O'Connor"
The Host as the Driver of the Microbiota in the Gut and External Environment of Drosophila melanogaster,26150460,10.1128/AEM.01442-15,"Most associations between animals and their gut microbiota are dynamic, involving sustained transfer of food-associated microbial cells into the gut and shedding of microorganisms into the external environment with feces, but the interacting effects of host and microbial factors on the composition of the internal and external microbial communities are poorly understood. This study on laboratory cultures of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster reared in continuous contact with their food revealed time-dependent changes of the microbial communities in the food that were strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of Drosophila. When germfree Drosophila eggs were aseptically added to nonsterile food, the microbiota in the food and flies converged to a composition dramatically different from that in fly-free food, showing that Drosophila has microbiota-independent effects on the food microbiota. The microbiota in both the flies that developed from unmanipulated eggs (bearing microorganisms) and the associated food was dominated by the bacteria most abundant on the eggs, demonstrating effective vertical transmission via surface contamination of eggs. Food coinoculated with a four-species defined bacterial community of Acetobacter and Lactobacillus species revealed the progressive elimination of Lactobacillus from the food bearing few or no Drosophila, indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions between Acetobacter and Lactobacillus. Drosophila at high densities ameliorated the Acetobacter/Lactobacillus antagonism, enabling Lactobacillus to persist. This study with Drosophila demonstrates how animals can have major, coordinated effects on the composition of microbial communities in the gut and immediate environment.",2015,"Adam C-N Wong, Yuan Luo, Xiangfeng Jing, Soeren Franzenburg, Alyssa Bost, Angela E Douglas, Adam C-N Wong, Yuan Luo, Xiangfeng Jing, Soeren Franzenburg, Alyssa Bost, Angela E Douglas"

Since behaviors reflect dynamic interactions between organisms and their environments, they are central targets for adaptive evolution. Drosophila melanogaster presents a powerful system for dissecting the genetic basis of behavioral phenotypes, since both the genetic background and environmental conditions can be controlled and behaviors accurately quantified. Single gene mutational analyses can identify the roles of individual genes within cellular pathways, whereas systems genetic approaches that exploit natural variation can construct genetic networks that underlie phenotypic variation. Combining these approaches with emerging technologies, such as genome editing, is likely to yield a comprehensive understanding of the neurogenetic underpinnings that orchestrate the manifestation of behaviors.",2015,"Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C Mackay, Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C Mackay"

Experimental Evolution under Fluctuating Thermal Conditions Does Not Reproduce Patterns of Adaptive Clinal Differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,26655772,10.1086/683252,"Experimental evolution can be a useful tool for testing the impact of environmental factors on adaptive changes in populations, and this approach is being increasingly used to understand the potential for evolutionary responses in populations under changing climates. However, selective factors will often be more complex in natural populations than in laboratory environments and produce different patterns of adaptive differentiation. Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations. These findings highlight the complexity of factors affecting trait evolution in natural populations and indicate that caution is required when inferring likely evolutionary responses from the outcome of experimental evolution studies.",2015,"Vanessa Kellermann, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Volker Loeschcke, Vanessa Kellermann, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Neda Nasiri Moghadam, Volker Loeschcke"
Acp70A regulates Drosophila pheromones through juvenile hormone induction,25484200,10.1016/j.ibmb.2014.11.008,"Mated Drosophila melanogaster females show a decrease in mating receptivity, enhanced ovogenesis, egg-laying and activation of juvenile hormone (JH) production. Components in the male seminal fluid, especially the sex peptide ACP70A stimulate these responses in females. Here we demonstrate that ACP70A is involved in the down-regulation of female sex pheromones and hydrocarbon (CHC) production. Drosophila G10 females which express Acp70A under the control of the vitellogenin gene yp1, produced fewer pheromones and CHCs. There was a dose-dependent relationship between the number of yp1-Acp70A alleles and the reduction of these compounds. Similarly, a decrease in CHCs and diene pheromones was observed in da > Acp70A flies that ubiquitously overexpress Acp70A. Quantitative-PCR experiments showed that the expression of Acp70A in G10 females was the same as in control males and 5 times lower than in da > Acp70A females. Three to four days after injection with 4.8 pmol ACP70A, females from two different strains, exhibited a significant decrease in CHC and pheromone levels. Similar phenotypes were observed in ACP70A injected flies whose ACP70A receptor expression was knocked-down by RNAi and in flies which overexpress ACP70A N-terminal domain. These results suggest that the action of ACP70A on CHCs could be a consequence of JH activation. Female flies exposed to a JH analog had reduced amounts of pheromones, whereas genetic ablation of the corpora allata or knock-down of the JH receptor Met, resulted in higher amounts of both CHCs and pheromonal dienes. Mating had negligible effects on CHC levels, however pheromone amounts were slightly reduced 3 and 4 days post copulation. The physiological significance of ACP70A on female pheromone synthesis is discussed.",2015,"GwÃ©naÃ«lle Bontonou, Haq Abdul Shaik, BÃ©atrice Denis, Claude Wicker-Thomas, GwÃ©naÃ«lle Bontonou, Haq Abdul Shaik, BÃ©atrice Denis, Claude Wicker-Thomas"
Synergistic antitumor effect of adenovirus armed with Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase and nucleoside analogs for human breast carcinoma in vitro and in vivo,26203222,10.2147/DDDT.S81717,"Background:
      
    

    
      Suicide gene therapy in cancer can selectively kill tumors without damaging normal tissues. Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK), an original suicide kinase, makes use of the carcinomatous suicide gene therapy for broader substrate specificity and a higher catalytic rate.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      To enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of Dm-dNK and maintain its substrate specificity and safety control in the meantime, the conditionally replicative gene-viral system, ZD55-dNK (which contains the selective replication adenovirus, ZD55, encoded with Dm-dNK), was investigated in pushing a deeper development of this strategy. Selective replication, cell killing efficacy, and cytotoxicity, in combination with chemotherapy, were applied to two breast cell lines (MDA231 and MCF7 cells), two normal cell lines (WI38 and MRC5 cells), and the MCF7 xenograft model in vivo.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The preclinical study showed that ZD55-dNK, combined with 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (DFDC), synergistically inhibited adenovirus replication in vitro but maintained specifically cancer cell killing efficacy. ZD55-dNK also greatly improved the antineoplastic effect in vitro and in breast cancer xenograft in vivo.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The concomitant use of ZD55-dNK and DFDC is possibly a novel and promising approach to breast cancer treatment, and further investigation on the safe control of excessive virus replication and the efficacy of this approach in humans is warranted.",2015,"Miao Tang, Cong Zu, Anning He, Wenqian Wang, Bo Chen, Xinyu Zheng, Miao Tang, Cong Zu, Anning He, Wenqian Wang, Bo Chen, Xinyu Zheng"
Characterization of a Drosophila ortholog of the Cdc7 kinase: a role for Cdc7 in endoreplication independent of Chiffon,25451925,10.1074/jbc.M114.597948,"Cdc7 is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates components of the pre-replication complex during DNA replication initiation. Cdc7 is highly conserved, and Cdc7 orthologs have been characterized in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Cdc7 is activated specifically during late G1/S phase by binding to its regulatory subunit, Dbf4. Drosophila melanogaster contains a Dbf4 ortholog, Chiffon, which is essential for chorion amplification in Drosophila egg chambers. However, no Drosophila ortholog of Cdc7 has yet been characterized. Here, we report the functional and biochemical characterization of a Drosophila ortholog of Cdc7. Co-expression of Drosophila Cdc7 and Chiffon is able to complement a growth defect in yeast containing a temperature-sensitive Cdc7 mutant. Cdc7 and Chiffon physically interact and can be co-purified from insect cells. Cdc7 phosphorylates the known Cdc7 substrates Mcm2 and histone H3 in vitro, and Cdc7 kinase activity is stimulated by Chiffon and inhibited by the Cdc7-specific inhibitor XL413. Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells deficient for Cdc7 have a defect in two types of DNA replication, endoreplication and chorion gene amplification. However, follicle cells deficient for Chiffon have a defect in chorion gene amplification but still undergo endocycling. Our results show that Cdc7 interacts with Chiffon to form a functional Dbf4-dependent kinase complex and that Cdc7 is necessary for DNA replication in Drosophila egg chamber follicle cells. Additionally, we show that Chiffon is a member of an expanding subset of DNA replication initiation factors that are not strictly required for endoreplication in Drosophila.",2015,"Robert Stephenson, Marcus R Hosler, Navnath S Gavande, Arun K Ghosh, Vikki M Weake, Robert Stephenson, Marcus R Hosler, Navnath S Gavande, Arun K Ghosh, Vikki M Weake"
Context-specific comparison of sleep acquisition systems in Drosophila,26519516,10.1242/bio.013011,"Sleep is conserved across phyla and can be measured through electrophysiological or behavioral characteristics. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides an excellent model for investigating the genetic and neural mechanisms that regulate sleep. Multiple systems exist for measuring fly activity, including video analysis and single-beam (SB) or multi-beam (MB) infrared (IR)-based monitoring. In this study, we compare multiple sleep parameters of individual flies using a custom-built video-based acquisition system, and commercially available SB- or MB-IR acquisition systems. We report that all three monitoring systems appear sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in sleep duration associated with diet, age, and mating status. Our data also demonstrate that MB-IR detection appeared more sensitive than the SB-IR for detecting baseline nuances in sleep architecture, while architectural changes associated with varying life-history and environment were generally detected across all acquisition types. Finally, video recording of flies in an arena allowed us to measure the effect of ambient environment on sleep. These experiments demonstrate a robust effect of arena shape and size as well as light levels on sleep duration and architecture, and highlighting the versatility of tracking-based sleep acquisition. These findings provide insight into the context-specific basis for choosing between Drosophila sleep acquisition systems, describe a novel cost-effective system for video tracking, and characterize sleep analysis using the MB-IR sleep analysis.

Girdin-mediated interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton are required for epithelial morphogenesis in Drosophila,25968313,10.1242/dev.122002,"E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is fundamental for epithelial tissue morphogenesis, physiology and repair. E-cadherin is a core transmembrane constituent of the zonula adherens (ZA), a belt-like adherens junction located at the apicolateral border in epithelial cells. The anchorage of ZA components to cortical actin filaments strengthens cell-cell cohesion and allows for junction contractility, which shapes epithelial tissues during development. Here, we report that the cytoskeletal adaptor protein Girdin physically and functionally interacts with components of the cadherin-catenin complex during Drosophila embryogenesis. Fly Girdin is broadly expressed throughout embryonic development and enriched at the ZA in epithelial tissues. Girdin associates with the cytoskeleton and co-precipitates with the cadherin-catenin complex protein Î±-Catenin (Î±-Cat). Girdin mutations strongly enhance adhesion defects associated with reduced DE-cadherin (DE-Cad) expression. Moreover, the fraction of DE-Cad molecules associated with the cytoskeleton decreases in the absence of Girdin, thereby identifying Girdin as a positive regulator of adherens junction function. Girdin mutant embryos display isolated epithelial cell cysts and rupture of the ventral midline, consistent with defects in cell-cell cohesion. In addition, loss of Girdin impairs the collective migration of epithelial cells, resulting in dorsal closure defects. We propose that Girdin stabilizes epithelial cell adhesion and promotes morphogenesis by regulating the linkage of the cadherin-catenin complex to the cytoskeleton.",2015,"Elise Houssin, Ulrich Tepass, Patrick Laprise, Elise Houssin, Ulrich Tepass, Patrick Laprise"
The small G protein Arl5 contributes to endosome-to-Golgi traffic by aiding the recruitment of the GARP complex to the Golgi,25795912,10.1242/bio.201410975,"The small G proteins of the Arf family play critical roles in membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton organization. However, the function of some members of the family remains poorly understood including Arl5 which is widely conserved in eukaryotes. Humans have two closely related Arl5 paralogues (Arl5a and Arl5b), and both Arl5a and Arl5b localize to the trans-Golgi with Arl5b being involved in retrograde traffic from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. To investigate the function of Arl5, we have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. We find that the single Arl5 orthologue in Drosophila also localizes to the trans-Golgi, but flies lacking the Arl5 gene are viable and fertile. By using both liposome and column based affinity chromatography methods we find that Arl5 interacts with the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex that acts in the tethering of vesicles moving from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In Drosophila tissues the GARP complex is partially displaced from the Golgi when Arl5 is absent, and the late endosomal compartment is enlarged. In addition, in HeLa cells GARP also becomes cytosolic upon depletion of Arl5b. These phenotypes are consistent with a role in endosome-to-Golgi traffic, but are less severe than loss of GARP itself. Thus it appears that Arl5 is one of the factors that directs the recruitment of the GARP complex to the trans-Golgi, and this function is conserved in both flies and humans.",2015,"ClÃ¡udia Rosa-Ferreira, Chantal Christis, Isabel L Torres, Sean Munro, ClÃ¡udia Rosa-Ferreira, Chantal Christis, Isabel L Torres, Sean Munro"
Conservation of the ethanol-induced locomotor stimulant response among arthropods,25721420,10.1159/000370099,"Ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation has been variously described as reflective of the disinhibitory, euphoric, or reinforcing effects of ethanol and is commonly used as an index of acute ethanol sensitivity in rodents. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also shows a locomotor stimulant response to ethanol that is believed to occur via conserved, ethanol-sensitive neurobiological mechanisms, but it is currently unknown whether this response is conserved among arthropod species or is idiosyncratic to D. melanogaster. The current experiments surveyed locomotor responses to ethanol in a phylogenetically diverse panel of insects and other arthropod species. A clear ethanol-induced locomotor stimulant response was seen in 9 of 13 Drosophilidae species tested, in 8 of 10 other species of insects, and in an arachnid (wolf spider) and a myriapod (millipede) species. Given the diverse phylogenies of the species that showed the response, these experiments support the hypothesis that locomotor stimulation is a conserved behavioral response to ethanol among arthropod species. Further comparative studies are needed to determine whether the specific neurobiological mechanisms known to underlie the stimulant response in D. melanogaster are conserved among arthropod and vertebrate species.",2015,"Christopher L Kliethermes, Christopher L Kliethermes"
Choosing mates based on the diet of your ancestors: replication of non-genetic assortative mating in Drosophila melanogaster,26339551,10.7717/peerj.1173,"Assortative mating has been a focus of considerable research because of its potential to influence biodiversity at many scales. Sharon et al. (2010) discovered that an inbred strain of Drosophila melanogaster mated assortatively based on the diet of previous generations, leading to initial reproductive isolation without genetic evolution. This behavior was reproduced by manipulating the microbiome independently of the diet, pointing to extracellular bacterial symbionts as the assortative mating cue. To further investigate the biological significance of this result, we attempted to reproduce this phenomenon in an independent laboratory using different genotypes and additional mating assays. Supporting the previous result, we found that a different inbred strain also mated assortatively based on the diets of previous generations. However, we were unable to generate assortative mating in an outbred strain from North Carolina. Our results support the potential for non-genetic mechanisms to influence reproductive isolation, but additional work is needed to investigate the importance of this mechanism in natural populations of Drosophila.",2015,"Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner, Michael A Najarro, Matt Sumethasorn, Alexandra Lamoureux, Thomas L Turner"

The Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of TDP-43 (TBPH) shares many characteristics with the human protein. Using a TDP-43 aggregation inducer previously developed in human cells, we created a transgenic fly that shows an adult locomotive defect. Phenotype onset correlates with a physiologically age-related drop of TDP-43/TBPH mRNA and protein levels, seen both in mice and flies. Artificial reduction of mRNA levels, in vivo, anticipates the locomotion defect to the larval stage. Our study links, for the first time, aggregation and the age-related, evolutionary conserved reduction of TDP-43/TBPH levels with the onset of an ALS-like locomotion defect in a Drosophila model.

Context-dependent effects of Y chromosome and mitochondrial haplotype on male locomotive activity in Drosophila melanogaster,26201506,10.1111/jeb.12702,"Some regions of the genome exhibit sexual asymmetries in inheritance and are thus subjected to sex-biased evolutionary forces. Maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) enables mtDNA mutations harmful to males, but not females, to accumulate. In the face of male-harmful mtDNA mutation accumulation, selection will favour the evolution of compensatory modifiers in the nuclear genome that offset fitness losses to males. The Y chromosome is a candidate to host these modifiers, because it is paternally inherited, known to harbour an abundance of genetic variation for male fertility, and therefore likely to be under strong selection to uphold male viability. Here, we test for intergenomic interactions involving mtDNA and Y chromosomes in male Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we examine effects of each of these genomic regions, and their interaction, on locomotive activity, across different environmental contexts--both dietary and social. We found that both the mtDNA haplotype and Y chromosome haplotype affected activity in males assayed in an environment perceived as social. These effects, however, were not evident in males assayed in perceived solitary environments, and neither social nor solitary treatments revealed evidence for intergenomic interactions. Finally, the magnitude and direction of these genetic effects was further contingent on the diet treatment of the males. Thus, genes within the mtDNA and Y chromosome are involved in genotype-by-environment interactions. These interactions might contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation within these asymmetrically inherited gene regions and complicate the dynamics of genetic interactions between the mtDNA and the Y chromosome.",2015,"R Dean, B Lemos, D K Dowling, R Dean, B Lemos, D K Dowling"

The most common approach to reference-based genome assembly is a single round of alignment followed by quality filtering and variant detection. We evaluated variations and extensions of this approach and settled on an assembly strategy that utilizes two alignment programs and incorporates both substitutions and short indels to construct an updated reference for a second round of mapping prior to final variant detection. Utilizing this approach, we reassembled published D. melanogaster population genomic data sets and added unpublished genomes from several sub-Saharan populations. Most notably, we present aligned data from phase 3 of the Drosophila Population Genomics Project (DPGP3), which provides 197 genomes from a single ancestral range population of D. melanogaster (from Zambia). The large sample size, high genetic diversity, and potentially simpler demographic history of the DPGP3 sample will make this a highly valuable resource for fundamental population genetic research. The complete set of assemblies described here, termed the Drosophila Genome Nexus, presently comprises 623 consistently aligned genomes and is publicly available in multiple formats with supporting documentation and bioinformatic tools.

Octopamine mediates starvation-induced hyperactivity in adult Drosophila,25848004,10.1073/pnas.1417838112,"Starved animals often exhibit elevated locomotion, which has been speculated to partly resemble foraging behavior and facilitate food acquisition and energy intake. Despite its importance, the neural mechanism underlying this behavior remains unknown in any species. In this study we confirmed and extended previous findings that starvation induced locomotor activity in adult fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster. We also showed that starvation-induced hyperactivity was directed toward the localization and acquisition of food sources, because it could be suppressed upon the detection of food cues via both central nutrient-sensing and peripheral sweet-sensing mechanisms, via induction of food ingestion. We further found that octopamine, the insect counterpart of vertebrate norepinephrine, as well as the neurons expressing octopamine, were both necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced hyperactivity. Octopamine was not required for starvation-induced changes in feeding behaviors, suggesting independent regulations of energy intake behaviors upon starvation. Taken together, our results establish a quantitative behavioral paradigm to investigate the regulation of energy homeostasis by the CNS and identify a conserved neural substrate that links organismal metabolic state to a specific behavioral output.",2015,"Zhe Yang, Yue Yu, Vivian Zhang, Yinjun Tian, Wei Qi, Liming Wang, Zhe Yang, Yue Yu, Vivian Zhang, Yinjun Tian, Wei Qi, Liming Wang"
"Two inwardly rectifying potassium channels, Irk1 and Irk2, play redundant roles in Drosophila renal tubule function",26224687,10.1152/ajpregu.00148.2015,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channels play essential roles in renal physiology across phyla. Barium-sensitive K(+) conductances are found on the basolateral membrane of a variety of insect Malpighian (renal) tubules, including Drosophila melanogaster. We found that barium decreases the lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference in isolated perfused Drosophila tubules and decreases fluid secretion and transepithelial K(+) flux. In those insect species in which it has been studied, transcripts from multiple genes encoding inwardly rectifying K(+) channels are expressed in the renal (Malpighian) tubule. In Drosophila melanogaster, this includes transcripts of the Irk1, Irk2, and Irk3 genes. The role of each of these gene products in renal tubule function is unknown. We found that simultaneous knockdown of Irk1 and Irk2 in the principal cell of the fly tubule decreases transepithelial K(+) flux, with no additive effect of Irk3 knockdown, and decreases barium sensitivity of transepithelial K(+) flux by ??0%. Knockdown of any of the three inwardly rectifying K(+) channels individually has no effect, nor does knocking down Irk3 simultaneously with Irk1 or Irk2. Irk1/Irk2 principal cell double-knockdown tubules remain sensitive to the kaliuretic effect of cAMP. Inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain and Irk1/Irk2 double knockdown have additive effects on K(+) flux, and 75% of transepithelial K(+) transport is due to Irk1/Irk2 or ouabain-sensitive pathways. In conclusion, Irk1 and Irk2 play redundant roles in transepithelial ion transport in the Drosophila melanogaster renal tubule and are additive to Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-dependent pathways.",2015,"Yipin Wu, Michel Baum, Chou-Long Huang, Aylin R Rodan, Yipin Wu, Michel Baum, Chou-Long Huang, Aylin R Rodan"
A gene expression atlas of a bicoid-depleted Drosophila embryo reveals early canalization of cell fate,25605785,10.1242/dev.117796,"In developing embryos, gene regulatory networks drive cells towards discrete terminal fates, a process called canalization. We studied the behavior of the anterior-posterior segmentation network in Drosophila melanogaster embryos by depleting a key maternal input, bicoid (bcd), and measuring gene expression patterns of the network at cellular resolution. This method results in a gene expression atlas containing the levels of mRNA or protein expression of 13 core patterning genes over six time points for every cell of the blastoderm embryo. This is the first cellular resolution dataset of a genetically perturbed Drosophila embryo that captures all cells in 3D. We describe the technical developments required to build this atlas and how the method can be employed and extended by others. We also analyze this novel dataset to characterize the degree and timing of cell fate canalization in the segmentation network. We find that in two layers of this gene regulatory network, following depletion of bcd, individual cells rapidly canalize towards normal cell fates. This result supports the hypothesis that the segmentation network directly canalizes cell fate, rather than an alternative hypothesis whereby cells are initially mis-specified and later eliminated by apoptosis. Our gene expression atlas provides a high resolution picture of a classic perturbation and will enable further computational modeling of canalization and gene regulation in this transcriptional network.",2015,"Max V Staller, Charless C Fowlkes, Meghan D J Bragdon, Zeba Wunderlich, Javier Estrada, Angela H DePace, Max V Staller, Charless C Fowlkes, Meghan D J Bragdon, Zeba Wunderlich, Javier Estrada, Angela H DePace"
Recent progress and open questions in Drosophila dosage compensation,26213294,10.1080/19336934.2015.1074786,"Sexual dimorphism is observed in many traits across diverse taxa, and often it is quite extreme. Within a species, individuals of opposing sex can appear strikingly different, reflecting differences at the molecular level that may be similarly striking. Among the most extreme cases of such molecular sexual dimorphism is the quantity of sex chromosomes that each sex possesses. Hemizygous sex chromosomes are common to many species, and various mechanisms have evolved to regulate transcriptional activity to ensure appropriate sex chromosome-to-autosome gene expression stoichiometry. Among the most thoroughly investigated of these mechanisms is Drosophila melanogaster's male-specific lethal (MSL) complex-mediated dosage compensation. In Drosophila, the male X chromosome transcription is upregulated approximately two-fold in somatic tissues to counterbalance the effects of sex chromosome hemizygosity on transcript abundance. Despite dramatic advances in our understanding of the Drosophila dosage compensation, many questions remain unanswered, and our understanding of its molecular underpinnings remains incomplete. In this review, we synthesize recent progress in the field as a means to highlight open questions, including how the MSL complex targets the X chromosome, how dosage compensation has shaped evolution of X-linked genes, and the degree to which MSL complex-mediated dosage compensation varies in activity across somatic tissues.",2015,"Steven P Vensko 2nd, Eric A Stone, Steven P Vensko 2nd, Eric A Stone"

The Drosophila Zinc Finger Transcription Factor Ouija Board Controls Ecdysteroid Biosynthesis through Specific Regulation of spookier,26658797,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005712,"Steroid hormones are crucial for many biological events in multicellular organisms. In insects, the principal steroid hormones are ecdysteroids, which play essential roles in regulating molting and metamorphosis. During larval and pupal development, ecdysteroids are synthesized in the prothoracic gland (PG) from dietary cholesterol via a series of hydroxylation and oxidation steps. The expression of all but one of the known ecdysteroid biosynthetic enzymes is restricted to the PG, but the transcriptional regulatory networks responsible for generating such exquisite tissue-specific regulation is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we report identification and characterization of the C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor Ouija board (Ouib) necessary for ecdysteroid production in the PG in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of ouib is predominantly limited to the PG, and genetic null mutants of ouib result in larval developmental arrest that can be rescued by administrating an active ecdysteroid. Interestingly, ouib mutant animals exhibit a strong reduction in the expression of one ecdysteroid biosynthetic enzyme, spookier. Using a cell culture-based luciferase reporter assay, Ouib protein stimulates transcription of spok by binding to a specific ~15 bp response element in the spok PG enhancer element. Most remarkable, the developmental arrest phenotype of ouib mutants is rescued by over-expression of a functionally-equivalent paralog of spookier. These observations imply that the main biological function of Ouib is to specifically regulate spookier transcription during Drosophila development.",2015,"Tatsuya Komura-Kawa, Keiko Hirota, Yuko Shimada-Niwa, Rieko Yamauchi, MaryJane Shimell, Tetsuro Shinoda, Akiyoshi Fukamizu, Michael B O'Connor, Ryusuke Niwa, Tatsuya Komura-Kawa, Keiko Hirota, Yuko Shimada-Niwa, Rieko Yamauchi, MaryJane Shimell, Tetsuro Shinoda, Akiyoshi Fukamizu, Michael B O'Connor, Ryusuke Niwa"

We show that Tolloid, via its N-terminal CUB domains, interacts with Collagen IV, which enhances Tolloid activity towards its substrate Sog, and facilitates Tsg-dependent stimulation of cleavage. In contrast, the two most C-terminal Tld CUB domains mediate Sog interaction to facilitate its processing as, based on our structural data, Tolloid curvature positions bound Sog in proximity to the protease domain. Having ascribed functions to the Tolloid non-catalytic domains, we recapitulate embryonic BMP gradient formation in their absence, by artificially tethering the Tld protease domain to Sog.

Cultured neurons undergo a consistent developmental process, culminating in an elaborate neuronal network with distinct functional and morphological characteristics. Throughout this development, a time-dependent increase in intracellular expression levels of AÎ²42 was detected, followed by extracellular staining at a later time point. When compared to controls, AÎ²42 cultures exhibited enhanced levels of apoptosis, resulting in reduced cell viability. Moreover, as primary culture preparations enable high resolution monitoring of neuronal phenotypes, we were able to detect subtle morphological changes in neurons expressing AÎ²42, namely an enhancement in neurite outgrowth and arborization, which preceded the effect of neurodegeneration.

Functional genomics of odor-guided behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,11238254,10.1093/chemse/26.2.215,"The avoidance response to repellent odorants in Drosophila melanogaster, a response essential for survival, provides an advantageous model for studies on the genetic architecture of olfactory behavior. Transposon tagging in a highly inbred strain of flies in combination with a rapid and simple statistical behavioral assay enables the identification of not only large phenotypic effects, but also small aberrations from wild-type avoidance behavior. The recent completion of the sequence of the Drosophila genome facilitates the molecular characterization of transposon-tagged genes and correlation between gene expression and behavior in smell-impaired (smi) mutant lines. Quantitative genetic analyses of a collection of smi lines in a co-isogenic background revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions among genes that shape the olfactory avoidance response. Candidate genes for several of these transposon-tagged smi loci implicate genes that mediate odorant recognition, including a novel odorant binding protein; signal propagation, including a voltage-gated sodium channel; and a protein containing multiple leucine rich repeats and PDZ domains likely to be involved in postsynaptic organization in the olfactory pathway.

"Distinct binding specificity of the multiple PDZ domains of INADL, a human protein with homology to INAD from Drosophila melanogaster",11509564,10.1074/jbc.M104208200,"PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules that typically bind to short peptide sequences at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins. Proteins containing multiple PDZ domains often bind to different trans-membrane and intracellular proteins, playing a central role as organizers of multimeric complexes. To characterize the rules underlying the binding specificity of different PDZ domains, we have assembled a novel repertoire of random peptides that are displayed at high density at the carboxyl terminus of the capsid D protein of bacteriophage lambda. We have exploited this combinatorial library to determine the peptide binding preference of the seven PDZ domains of human INADL, a multi-PDZ protein that is homologous to the INAD protein of Drosophila melanogaster. This approach has permitted the determination of the consensus ligand for each PDZ domain and the assignment to class I, class II, and to a new specificity class, class IV, characterized by the presence of an acidic residue at the carboxyl-terminal position. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the involvement of specific residues at contact positions in determining the domain binding preference. However, these experiments failed to reveal simple rules that would permit the association of the chemical characteristics of any given residue in the peptide binding pocket to the preference for specific amino acid sequences in the ligand peptide. Rather, they suggested that to infer the binding preference of any PDZ domain, it is necessary to simultaneously take into account all contact positions by using computational procedures. For this purpose we extended the SPOT algorithm, originally developed for SH3 domains, to evaluate the probability that any peptide would bind to any given PDZ domain.",2001,"P Vaccaro, B Brannetti, L Montecchi-Palazzi, S Philipp, M Helmer Citterich, G Cesareni, L Dente, P Vaccaro, B Brannetti, L Montecchi-Palazzi, S Philipp, M Helmer Citterich, G Cesareni, L Dente"

Selectivity of protein oxidative damage during aging in Drosophila melanogaster,11696009,10.1042/0264-6021:3600209,"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether oxidation of various proteins during the aging process occurs selectively or randomly, and whether the same proteins are damaged in different species. Protein oxidative damage to the proteins, present in the matrix of mitochondria in the flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster and manifested as carbonyl modifications, was detected immunochemically with anti-dinitrophenyl-group antibodies. Aconitase was found to be the only protein in the mitochondrial matrix that exhibited an age-associated increase in carbonylation. The accrual of oxidative damage was accompanied by an approx. 50% loss in aconitase activity. An increase in ambient temperature, which elevates the rate of metabolism and shortens the life span of flies, caused an elevation in the amount of aconitase carbonylation and an accelerated loss in its activity. Exposure to 100% ambient oxygen showed that aconitase was highly susceptible to undergo oxidative damage and loss of activity under oxidative stress. Administration of fluoroacetate, a competitive inhibitor of aconitase activity, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the life span of the flies. Results of the present study demonstrate that protein oxidative damage during aging is a selective phenomenon, and might constitute a mechanism by which oxidative stress causes age-associated losses in specific biochemical functions.",2001,"N Das, R L Levine, W C Orr, R S Sohal, N Das, R L Levine, W C Orr, R S Sohal"

Eye stalks or no eye stalks: a structural comparison of pupal development in the stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodiopsis and in Drosophila,11304713,10.1002/cne.1155,"After emergence from the puparium, stalk-eyed flies of the family Diopsidae rapidly expand their head capsule so that the eyes and optic lobes are displaced at the ends of stalks that extend from the central head. Because the expansion takes place in only 15 minutes, we are especially interested in ontogenetic modifications that may facilitate such a rapid and dramatic change. To examine the pupal development of the brain, we used Bodian staining in the stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodiopsis whitei and compared it with development in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which serves as a ""typical"" dipteran example without eye stalks. Early in pupal development, the neuropil organization of the two species is fairly similar. In both species, columns are present in the outer medulla and giant fibers are discernible in the lobula plate. In contrast to D. melanogaster, C. whitei shows a small, neck-like constriction between the optic lobes and the rest of the brain. By 20% of pupal development, the divergence is more apparent, and by 30%, the future eye stalk and optic nerve of C. whitei has started to form. During the remaining 70% of development, the initially thick optic nerve narrows, and becomes gradually elongated, eventually coiling and folding throughout the short eye stalk. Similarly, the cuticle of the surrounding region becomes constricted, slightly elongated, and gradually appears more and more densely corrugated, like an accordion bellows. However, except for the formation of the optic nerve, the dense aggregation of cuticle around it, and a shift in orientation of the neuropils, the developmental programs of the two species are remarkably similar. This suggests that only a few aspects of development have been modified during the course of evolution to generate the stalk-eyed phenotype. At eclosion, the imago of C. whitei goes through a pumping process to inflate the eye stalks to their full length. Measurements of the diameter of the optic nerve before and after the expansion reveal only a small decrease. We propose that the cuticular folding of the eye stalk as well as the coiling of the optic nerve prepare the pupa well for the rapid and dramatic eye-stalk inflation after eclosion.",2001,"E K Buschbeck, J L Roosevelt, R R Hoy, E K Buschbeck, J L Roosevelt, R R Hoy"
Trap a gene and find out its function: toward functional genomics in Drosophila,12092900,10.3109/01677060109167373,"Many declared aims of the genome projects have been achieved. The total genomic sequences of several relatively noncomplex/complex organisms (such as E. coli, yeast, Caenorhabditis, Drosophila) are being determined, and the nucleotide sequencing of the entire human genome will be complete in the near future. However, this achievement is not the end of the road but rather the first step toward the functional understanding of the genome of humans and other organisms. The determined linear nucleotide sequences remain only lists of A, C, G and T, unless they are given functional significance. The coding sequences of genes can be identified in a relatively reliable manner by computational methods, but the exact function of their protein products can rarely be determined without obtaining much additional information, e.g., by biochemical or cell biological methods. Thus, following sequencing, the next step must be to assign functions to the identified genes. The final goal of genome research today may look futuristic, but the knowledge of the function of every single gene and the interactions between them will finally allow us to understand the development and functioning of an organism as a whole. Gene-trapping methodology is a powerful strategy for cloning and identifying functional genes, as it marks a gene with a tag and simultaneously generates a corresponding genetic variation for that particular locus. Therefore, gene trapping is an extremely useful tool for functional genomics, establishing a correlation between the physical and genetic maps of the genome. The relative simplicity of its genome and the availability of huge bodies of genetic and molecular information make Drosophila melanogaster one of the most important model organisms. Its genome will serve as a ""reference"" for the in-depth analysis of the organization of more complex eukaryotic genomes. Multifaceted approaches to Drosophila functional genomics and the dual-tagging gene trap system newly developed for functional analysis of Drosophila genes are discussed in this review.",2001,"T Lukacsovich, D Yamamoto, T Lukacsovich, D Yamamoto"
"Rapid evolution of a cyclin A inhibitor gene, roughex, in Drosophila",11606707,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003752,"The recent sequencing of the complete genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has yielded about 30% of the predicted genes with no obvious counterparts in other organisms. These rapidly evolving genes remain largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence for a striking variability in an important Drosophila cell cycle regulator encoded by the gene roughex (rux) in closely related fly species. The unusual level of Rux protein variability indicates that there are very low overall constraints on amino acid substitutions. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, certain common features, including the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal and a functionally important N-terminal RXL cyclin-binding motif, exist between Rux and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of the Cip/Kip family.

Mushroom bodies and post-mating behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster females,11895142,10.3109/01677060109066198,"After mating, Drosophila melanogaster females lay substantially more eggs and mate rarely. Central to these changes is Sex peptide (SP), a male peptide transferred into the female during copulation. Injected into virgins, SP induces the same post mating response as observed after mating. In this study we investigated the role of the mushroom body (MB) in the SP response system. The SP response of females with either chemically ablated or mutant MBs was analyzed. After injection of SP, females with chemically ablated MBs reduce their receptivity and increase their ovulation and oviposition to the level of females with intact MBs. Virgin females with ablated MBs, however, show a constitutively elevated oviposition rate. Hence in untreated females, MBs are not implicated in the SP-induced reduction of receptivity and increase of ovulation. However, they depress the oviposition rate of virgins. Thus, SP has two functions for oviposition: it de-represses the MB-dependent block on the egg laying activity of virgins and additionally stimulates oviposition. SP-injected mushroom body miniature (mbm) females lay fewer eggs, ovulate less frequently, and mate more often than wild-type females. A model of the putative role of MBs and the gene product of mbm in SP-induced oviposition is presented.",2001,"I Fleischmann, B Cotton, Y Choffat, M Spengler, E Kubli, I Fleischmann, B Cotton, Y Choffat, M Spengler, E Kubli"
"The acetylcholinesterase gene and organophosphorus resistance in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina",11378416,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00186-7,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), encoded by the Ace gene, is the primary target of organophosphorous (OP) and carbamate insecticides. Ace mutations have been identified in OP resistants strains of Drosophila melanogaster. However, in the Australian sheep blowfly, Lucilia cuprina, resistance in field and laboratory generated strains is determined by point mutations in the Rop-1 gene, which encodes a carboxylesterase, E3. To investigate the apparent bias for the Rop-1/E3 mechanism in the evolution of OP resistance in L. cuprina, we have cloned the Ace gene from this species and characterized its product. Southern hybridization indicates the existence of a single Ace gene in L. cuprina. The amino acid sequence of L. cuprina AChE shares 85.3% identity with D. melanogaster and 92.4% with Musca domestica AChE. Five point mutations in Ace associated with reduced sensitivity to OP insecticides have been previously detected in resistant strains of D. melanogaster. These residues are identical in susceptible strains of D. melanogaster and L. cuprina, although different codons are used. Each of the amino acid substitutions that confer OP resistance in D. melanogaster could also occur in L. cuprina by a single non-synonymous substitution. These data suggest that the resistance mechanism used in L. cuprina is determined by factors other than codon bias. The same point mutations, singly and in combination, were introduced into the Ace gene of L. cuprina by site-directed mutagenesis and the resulting AChE enzymes expressed using a baculovirus system to characterise their kinetic properties and interactions with OP insecticides. The K(m) of wild type AChE for acetylthiocholine (ASCh) is 23.13 microM and the point mutations change the affinity to the substrate. The turnover number of Lucilia AChE for ASCh was estimated to be 1.27x10(3) min(-1), similar to Drosophila or housefly AChE. The single amino acid replacements reduce the affinities of the AChE for OPs and give up to 8.7-fold OP insensitivity, while combined mutations give up to 35-fold insensitivity. However, other published studies indicate these same mutations yield higher levels of OP insensitivity in D. melanogaster and A. aegypti. The inhibition data indicate that the wild type form of AChE of L. cuprina is 12.4-fold less sensitive to OP inhibition than the susceptible form of E3, suggesting that the carboxylesterases may have a role in the protection of AChE via a sequestration mechanism. This provides a possible explanation for the bias towards the evolution of resistance via the Rop-1/E3 mechanism in L. cuprina.",2001,"Z Chen, R Newcomb, E Forbes, J McKenzie, P Batterham, Z Chen, R Newcomb, E Forbes, J McKenzie, P Batterham"
"Inferring parameters of mutation, selection and demography from patterns of synonymous site evolution in Drosophila",11139506,,"Selection acting on codon usage can cause patterns of synonymous evolution to deviate considerably from those expected under neutrality. To investigate the quantitative relationship between parameters of mutation, selection, and demography, and patterns of synonymous site divergence, we have developed a novel combination of population genetic models and likelihood methods of phylogenetic sequence analysis. Comparing 50 orthologous gene pairs from Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis and 27 from D. melanogaster and D. simulans, we show considerable variation between amino acids and genes in the strength of selection acting on codon usage and find evidence for both long-term and short-term changes in the strength of selection between species. Remarkably, D. melanogaster shows no evidence of current selection on codon usage, while its sister species D. simulans experiences only half the selection pressure for codon usage of their common ancestor. We also find evidence for considerable base asymmetries in the rate of mutation, such that the average synonymous mutation rate is 20-30% higher than in noncoding regions. A Bayesian approach is adopted to investigate how accounting for selection on codon usage influences estimates of the parameters of mutation.",2001,"G A McVean, J Vieira, G A McVean, J Vieira"
Genetic variation for preadult viability in Drosophila melanogaster,11580020,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb00680.x,"The extent of genetic variation in fitness and its components and genetic variation's dependence on environmental conditions remain key issues in evolutionary biology. We present measurements of genetic variation in preadult viability in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster, made at four different densities. By crossing flies heterozygous for a wild-type chromosome and one of two different balancers (TM1, TM2), we measure both heterozygous (TM1/+, TM2/+) and homozygous (+/+) viability relative to a standard genotype (TM1/TM2). Forty wild-type chromosomes were tested, of which 10 were chosen to be homozygous viable. The mean numbers produced varied significantly between chromosome lines, with an estimated between-line variance in log(e) numbers of 0.013. Relative viabilities also varied significantly across chromosome lines, with a variance in log(e) homozygous viability of 1.76 and of log(e) heterozygous viability of 0.165. The between-line variance for numbers emerging increased with density, from 0.009 at lowest density to 0.079 at highest. The genetic variance in relative viability increases with density, but not significantly. Overall, the effects of different chromosomes on relative viability were remarkably consistent across densities and across the two heterozygous genotypes (TM1, TM2). The 10 lines that carried homozygous viable wild-type chromosomes produced significantly more adults than the 30 lethal lines at low density and significantly fewer adults at the highest density. Similarly, there was a positive correlation between heterozygous viability and mean numbers at low density, but a negative correlation at high density.",2001,"M Gardner, K Fowler, L Partridge, N Barton, M Gardner, K Fowler, L Partridge, N Barton"

We were able to induce dominant suppressor alleles at the Su(P) locus by X-ray mutagenesis and hybrid dysgenesis, suggesting that null alleles of Su(P) confer the dominant suppressor phenotype.

In silico identification of novel selenoproteins in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,11493597,10.1093/embo-reports/kve151,"In selenoproteins, incorporation of the amino acid selenocysteine is specified by the UGA codon, usually a stop signal. The alternative decoding of UGA is conferred by an mRNA structure, the SECIS element, located in the 3'-untranslated region of the selenoprotein mRNA. Because of the non-standard use of the UGA codon, current computational gene prediction methods are unable to identify selenoproteins in the sequence of the eukaryotic genomes. Here we describe a method to predict selenoproteins in genomic sequences, which relies on the prediction of SECIS elements in coordination with the prediction of genes in which the strong codon bias characteristic of protein coding regions extends beyond a TGA codon interrupting the open reading frame. We applied the method to the Drosophila melanogaster genome, and predicted four potential selenoprotein genes. One of them belongs to a known family of selenoproteins, and we have tested experimentally two other predictions with positive results.

We found as wild type flies age, sensitivity to alcohol increases and circadian regulation of alcohol-induced behaviors weakens. Decreased circadian modulation is correlated with significantly greater alcohol sensitivity during the subjective day. The circadian clock modulates alcohol-induced mortality in younger flies with increased mortality following alcohol exposure at night. Older flies exhibit significantly longer recovery times following alcohol-induced sedation and increased mortality following binge-like or chronic alcohol exposure. Flies rendered arrhythmic either genetically or environmentally exhibit significantly increased alcohol sensitivity, longer recovery times and increased mortality.

Drosophila and genome-wide association studies: a review and resource for the functional dissection of human complex traits,28151408,10.1242/dmm.027680,"Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of susceptibility loci for common diseases with complex genetic etiologies. Although the susceptibility variants identified by GWAS usually have only modest effects on individual disease risk, they contribute to a substantial burden of trait variation in the overall population. GWAS also offer valuable clues to disease mechanisms that have long proven to be elusive. These insights could lead the way to breakthrough treatments; however, several challenges hinder progress, making innovative approaches to accelerate the follow-up of results from GWAS an urgent priority. Here, we discuss the largely untapped potential of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, for functional investigation of findings from human GWAS. We highlight selected examples where strong genomic conservation with humans along with the rapid and powerful genetic tools available for flies have already facilitated fine mapping of association signals, elucidated gene mechanisms, and revealed novel disease-relevant biology.

Biological phosphorylation of an Unnatural Base Pair (UBP) using a Drosophila melanogaster deoxynucleoside kinase (DmdNK) mutant,28323896,10.1371/journal.pone.0174163,"One research goal for unnatural base pair (UBP) is to replicate, transcribe and translate them in vivo. Accordingly, the corresponding unnatural nucleoside triphosphates must be available at sufficient concentrations within the cell. To achieve this goal, the unnatural nucleoside analogues must be phosphorylated to the corresponding nucleoside triphosphates by a cascade of three kinases. The first step is the monophosphorylation of unnatural deoxynucleoside catalyzed by deoxynucleoside kinases (dNK), which is generally considered the rate limiting step because of the high specificity of dNKs. Here, we applied a Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase (DmdNK) to the phosphorylation of an UBP (a pyrimidine analogue (6-amino-5-nitro-3-(1'-b-d-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, Z) and its complementary purine analogue (2-amino-8-(1'-b-d-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)-one, P). The results showed that DmdNK could efficiently phosphorylate only the dP nucleoside. To improve the catalytic efficiency, a DmdNK-Q81E mutant was created based on rational design and structural analyses. This mutant could efficiently phosphorylate both dZ and dP nucleoside. Structural modeling indicated that the increased efficiency of dZ phosphorylation by the DmdNK-Q81E mutant might be related to the three additional hydrogen bonds formed between E81 and the dZ base.

Genetics of alcohol consumption in Drosophila melanogaster,28627812,10.1111/gbb.12399,"Individual variation in alcohol consumption in human populations is determined by genetic, environmental, social and cultural factors. In contrast to humans, genetic contributions to complex behavioral phenotypes can be readily dissected in Drosophila, where both the genetic background and environment can be controlled and behaviors quantified through simple high-throughput assays. Here, we measured voluntary consumption of ethanol in ??000 individuals of each sex from an advanced intercross population derived from 37 lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel. Extreme quantitative trait loci mapping identified 385 differentially segregating allelic variants located in or near 291 genes at P < 10-8 . The effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with voluntary ethanol consumption are sex-specific, as found for other alcohol-related phenotypes. To assess causality, we used RNA interference knockdown or P{MiET1} mutants and their corresponding controls and functionally validated 86% of candidate genes in at least one sex. We constructed a genetic network comprised of 23 genes along with a separate trio and a pair of connected genes. Gene ontology analyses showed enrichment of developmental genes, including development of the nervous system. Furthermore, a network of human orthologs showed enrichment for signal transduction processes, protein metabolism and developmental processes, including nervous system development.

Parallel Activin and BMP signaling coordinates R7/R8 photoreceptor subtype pairing in the stochastic Drosophila retina,28853393,10.7554/eLife.25301,"Drosophila color vision is achieved by comparing outputs from two types of color-sensitive photoreceptors, R7 and R8.

Subtype specification is controlled by a stochastic decision in R7 and instructed to the underlying R8. We find that the Activin receptor Baboon is required in R8 to receive non-redundant signaling from the three Activin ligands, activating the transcription factor dSmad2. Concomitantly, two BMP ligands activate their receptor, Thickveins, and the transcriptional effector, Mad. The Amon TGFÎ² processing factor appears to regulate components of the TGFÎ² pathway specifically in pale R7.

The Evaluation of Geroprotective Effects of Selected Flavonoids in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans,29375370,10.3389/fphar.2017.00884,"Flavonoids is an intensively studied group of natural compounds with antioxidant, antineoplastic, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties. The present study intends to investigate the geroprotective action of three selected flavonoids (naringin, luteolin, chrysin) in two model organisms, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Luteolin and chrysin were shown to improve lifespan parameters when administered to both model organisms. The observed positive effects of these flavonoids in D. melanogaster were limited to females and were not associated with reduced fecundity or locomotor impairment. The life-extending effects of flavonoids were observed in N2 wild-type worms but absent in aak-2(gt33) mutants implying that these effects can be associated with AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Naringin improved lifespan parameters of C. elegans, but had no effect on D. melanogaster females; in some cases, naringin was found to decrease the lifespan of males. Compared to chrysin and luteolin, however, naringin more effectively activates Nrf2 target genes (particularly, GstD1) under oxidative stress. Then we compared molecular mechanisms of studied compounds and a well-known geroprotector rapamycin, using software tool GeroScope. There are no transcriptomic data on luteolin or chrysin provided by LINCS Project database. The bioinformatics comparison of transcriptomics data for A549 and MCF7 human cell lines treated with rapamycin or naringin revealed that these compounds share just a few common signaling pathways and quite distinct in their geroprotective action.

Mid-day siesta in natural populations of D. melanogaster from Africa exhibits an altitudinal cline and is regulated by splicing of a thermosensitive intron in the period clock gene,28114910,10.1186/s12862-017-0880-8,"Background:
      
    

    
      Many diurnal animals exhibit a mid-day 'siesta', generally thought to be an adaptive response aimed at minimizing exposure to heat on warm days, suggesting that in regions with cooler climates mid-day siestas might be a less prominent feature of animal behavior. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits thermal plasticity in its mid-day siesta that is partly governed by the thermosensitive splicing of the 3'-terminal intron (termed dmpi8) from the key circadian clock gene period (per). For example, decreases in temperature lead to progressively more efficient splicing, which increasingly favors activity over sleep during the mid-day. In this study we sought to determine if the adaptation of D. melanogaster from its ancestral range in the lowlands of tropical Africa to the cooler temperatures found at high altitudes involved changes in mid-day sleep behavior and/or dmpi8 splicing efficiency.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from different altitudes in tropical Africa we show that flies from high elevations have a reduced mid-day siesta and less consolidated sleep. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the per 3' untranslated region that has strong effects on dmpi8 splicing and mid-day sleep levels in both low and high altitude flies. Intriguingly, high altitude flies with a particular variant of this SNP exhibit increased dmpi8 splicing efficiency compared to their low altitude counterparts, consistent with reduced mid-day siesta. Thus, a boost in dmpi8 splicing efficiency appears to have played a prominent but not universal role in how African flies adapted to the cooler temperatures at high altitude.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Various Wolbachia genotypes differently influence host Drosophila dopamine metabolism and survival under heat stress conditions,29297293,10.1186/s12862-017-1104-y,"Background:
      
    

    
      One of the most widespread prokaryotic symbionts of invertebrates is the intracellular bacteria of Wolbachia genus which can be found in about 50% of insect species. Wolbachia causes both parasitic and mutualistic effects on its host that include manipulating the host reproductive systems in order to increase their transmission through the female germline, and increasing the host fitness. One of the mechanisms, promoting adaptation in biological organisms, is a non-specific neuroendocrine stress reaction. In insects, this reaction includes catecholamines, dopamine, serotonin and octopamine, which act as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neurohormones. The level of dopamine metabolism correlates with heat stress resistance in Drosophila adults.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To examine Wolbachia effect on Drosophila survival under heat stress and dopamine metabolism we used five strains carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 strain and cytoplasmic backgrounds with different genotype variants of Wolbachia (produced by 20 backcrosses of Bi90 males with appropriate source of Wolbachia). Non-infected Bi90 strain (treated with tetracycline for 3 generations) was used as a control group. We demonstrated that two of five investigated Wolbachia variants promote changes in Drosophila heat stress resistance and activity of enzymes that produce and degrade dopamine, alkaline phosphatase and dopamine-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase. What is especially interesting, wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia increases stress resistance and the intensity of dopamine metabolism, whereas wMelPop strain decreases them. wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on the survival under heat stress or dopamine metabolism. L-DOPA treatment, known to increase the dopamine content in Drosophila, levels the difference in survival under heat stress between all studied groups.

In cases where this assumption does not hold (e.g., when comparing cell types with different cell sizes) the expression data provide a distorted view of cellular events. Assuming constant numbers of total transcripts, increases in expression of some RNAs must be compensated for by decreases in expression of others. Therefore, we propose calibrating gene expression data to an external reference point, the number of cells in the sample, using whole-cell spike-ins. In a systematic dilution experiment, we mixed varying numbers of human cells with fixed numbers of Drosophila melanogaster cells and scaled the expression levels of the human genes relative to those of the Drosophila genes. This approach restored the original gene expression ratios generated by the dilutions. We then used Drosophila whole-cell spike-ins to uncover non-symmetric gene expression changes, in this case much larger numbers of induced than repressed genes, under perturbations of the human cell line P493-6. Drosophila whole-cell spike-ins are an experimentally and computationally easy and low-priced method to derive mRNA fold changes of absolute abundances from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) data.",2017,"Franziska Taruttis, Maren Feist, Phillip Schwarzfischer, Wolfram Gronwald, Dieter Kube, Rainer Spang, Julia C Engelmann, Franziska Taruttis, Maren Feist, Phillip Schwarzfischer, Wolfram Gronwald, Dieter Kube, Rainer Spang, Julia C Engelmann"
Idiothetic Path Integration in the Fruit Fly Drosophila melanogaster,28736164,10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.026,"After discovering a small drop of food, hungry flies exhibit a peculiar behavior in which they repeatedly stray from, but then return to, the newly discovered resource. To study this behavior in more detail, we tracked hungry Drosophila as they explored a large arena, focusing on the question of how flies remain near the food. To determine whether flies use external stimuli, we individually eliminated visual, olfactory, and pheromonal cues. In all cases, flies still exhibited a centralized search behavior, suggesting that none of these cues are absolutely required for navigation back to the food. To simultaneously eliminate visual and olfactory cues associated with the position of the food, we constructed an apparatus in which the food could be rapidly translated from the center of the arena. Flies continued to search around the original location, even after the food was moved to a new position. A random search model based on measured locomotor statistics could not reproduce the centered nature of the animal's trajectory. We conclude that this behavior is best explained by a form of path integration in which the flies use idiothetic cues to search near the location of the food. We argue that the use of path integration to perform a centered local search is not a specialization of Drosophila but rather represents an ancient behavioral mode that is homologous to the more elaborate foraging strategies of central place foragers such as ants.",2017,"Irene S Kim, Michael H Dickinson, Irene S Kim, Michael H Dickinson"
SMOC can act as both an antagonist and an expander of BMP signaling,28323621,10.7554/eLife.17935,"The matricellular protein SMOC (Secreted Modular Calcium binding protein) is conserved phylogenetically from vertebrates to arthropods. We showed previously that SMOC inhibits bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling downstream of its receptor via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, the most prominent effect of the Drosophila orthologue, pentagone (pent), is expanding the range of BMP signaling during wing patterning. Using SMOC deletion constructs we found that SMOC-?EC, lacking the extracellular calcium binding (EC) domain, inhibited BMP2 signaling, whereas SMOC-EC (EC domain only) enhanced BMP2 signaling. The SMOC-EC domain bound HSPGs with a similar affinity to BMP2 and could expand the range of BMP signaling in an in vitro assay by competition for HSPG-binding. Together with data from studies in vivo we propose a model to explain how these two activities contribute to the function of Pent in Drosophila wing development and SMOC in mammalian joint formation.",2017,"J Terrig Thomas, D Eric Dollins, Kristin R Andrykovich, Tehyen Chu, Brian G Stultz, Deborah A Hursh, Malcolm Moos, J Terrig Thomas, D Eric Dollins, Kristin R Andrykovich, Tehyen Chu, Brian G Stultz, Deborah A Hursh, Malcolm Moos"
Introduction of a male-harming mitochondrial haplotype via 'Trojan Females' achieves population suppression in fruit flies,28467301,10.7554/eLife.23551,"Pests are a global threat to biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health. Pest control approaches are thus numerous, but their implementation costly, damaging to non-target species, and ineffective at low population densities. The Trojan Female Technique (TFT) is a prospective self-perpetuating control technique that is species-specific and predicted to be effective at low densities. The goal of the TFT is to harness naturally occurring mutations in the mitochondrial genome that impair male fertility while having no effect on females. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for the TFT, by showing that introduction of a male fertility-impairing mtDNA haplotype into replicated populations of Drosophila melanogaster causes numerical population suppression, with the magnitude of effect positively correlated with its frequency at trial inception. Further development of the TFT could lead to establishing a control strategy that overcomes limitations of conventional approaches, with broad applicability to invertebrate and vertebrate species, to control environmental and economic pests.",2017,"Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Neil J Gemmell, Daniel M Tompkins, Damian K Dowling, Jonci Nikolai Wolff, Neil J Gemmell, Daniel M Tompkins, Damian K Dowling"
H2O2-Sensitive Isoforms of Drosophila melanogaster TRPA1 Act in Bitter-Sensing Gustatory Neurons to Promote Avoidance of UV During Egg-Laying,27932542,10.1534/genetics.116.195172,"The evolutionarily conserved TRPA1 channel can sense various stimuli including temperatures and chemical irritants. Recent results have suggested that specific isoforms of Drosophila TRPA1 (dTRPA1) are UV-sensitive and that their UV sensitivity is due to H2O2 sensitivity. However, whether such UV sensitivity served any physiological purposes in animal behavior was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that H2O2-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms promote avoidance of UV when adult Drosophila females are selecting sites for egg-laying. First, we show that blind/visionless females are still capable of sensing and avoiding UV during egg-laying when intensity of UV is high yet within the range of natural sunlight. Second, we show that such vision-independent UV avoidance is mediated by a group of bitter-sensing neurons on the proboscis that express H2O2-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms. We show that these bitter-sensing neurons exhibit dTRPA1-dependent UV sensitivity. Importantly, inhibiting activities of these bitter-sensing neurons, reducing their dTRPA1 expression, or reducing their H2O2-sensitivity all significantly reduced blind females' UV avoidance, whereas selectively restoring a H2O2-sensitive isoform of dTRPA1 in these neurons restored UV avoidance. Lastly, we show that specifically expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in these bitter-sensing neurons promotes egg-laying avoidance of red light, an otherwise neutral cue for egg-laying females. Together, these results demonstrate a physiological role of the UV-sensitive dTRPA1 isoforms, reveal that adult Drosophila possess at least two sensory systems for detecting UV, and uncover an unexpected role of bitter-sensing taste neurons in UV sensing.",2017,"Ananya R Guntur, Bin Gou, Pengyu Gu, Ruo He, Ulrich Stern, Yang Xiang, Chung-Hui Yang, Ananya R Guntur, Bin Gou, Pengyu Gu, Ruo He, Ulrich Stern, Yang Xiang, Chung-Hui Yang"
The Drosophila TRPA1 Channel and Neuronal Circuits Controlling Rhythmic Behaviours and Sleep in Response to Environmental Temperature,28972543,10.3390/ijms18102028,"trpA1 encodes a thermosensitive transient receptor potential channel (TRP channel) that functions in selection of preferred temperatures and noxious heat avoidance. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a role of TRPA1 in the control of rhythmic behaviours in Drosophila melanogaster. Activity levels during the afternoon and rhythmic temperature preference are both regulated by TRPA1. In contrast, TRPA1 is dispensable for temperature synchronisation of circadian clocks. We discuss the neuronal basis of TRPA1-mediated temperature effects on rhythmic behaviours, and conclude that they are mediated by partly overlapping but distinct neuronal circuits. We have previously shown that TRPA1 is required to maintain siesta sleep under warm temperature cycles. Here, we present new data investigating the neuronal circuit responsible for this regulation. First, we discuss the difficulties that remain in identifying the responsible neurons. Second, we discuss the role of clock neurons (s-LNv/DN1 network) in temperature-driven regulation of siesta sleep, and highlight the role of TRPA1 therein. Finally, we discuss the sexual dimorphic nature of siesta sleep and propose that the s-LNv/DN1 clock network could play a role in the integration of environmental information, mating status and other internal drives, to appropriately drive adaptive sleep/wake behaviour.",2017,"Sanne Roessingh, Ralf Stanewsky, Sanne Roessingh, Ralf Stanewsky"
Reactive oxygen species-dependent Toll/NF-ÎºB activation in the Drosophila hematopoietic niche confers resistance to wasp parasitism,29091025,10.7554/eLife.25496,"Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in the adult mammalian bone marrow ensure blood cell renewal. Their cellular microenvironment, called 'niche', regulates hematopoiesis both under homeostatic and immune stress conditions. In the Drosophila hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, the posterior signaling center (PSC) acts as a niche to regulate the hematopoietic response to immune stress such as wasp parasitism. This response relies on the differentiation of lamellocytes, a cryptic cell type, dedicated to pathogen encapsulation and killing. Here, we establish that Toll/NF-ÎºB pathway activation in the PSC in response to wasp parasitism non-cell autonomously induces the lymph gland immune response. Our data further establish a regulatory network where co-activation of Toll/NF-ÎºB and EGFR signaling by ROS levels in the PSC/niche controls lymph gland hematopoiesis under parasitism.

Olfactory detection of a bacterial short-chain fatty acid acts as an orexigenic signal in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,29079812,10.1038/s41598-017-14589-1,"Microorganisms inhabiting fermenting fruit produce chemicals that elicit strong behavioral responses in flies. Depending on their ecological niche, individuals confer a positive or a negative valence to a chemical and, accordingly, they trigger either attractive or repulsive behaviors. We studied the case of bacterial short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) that trigger opposite behaviors in adult and larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. We determined that SCFA-attractive responses depend on two larval exclusive chemoreceptors, Or30a and Or94b. Of those SCFA, propionic acid improves larval survival in suboptimal rearing conditions and supports growth. Olfactory detection of propionic acid specifically is sufficient to trigger feeding behaviors, and this effect requires the correct activity of Or30a+ and Or94b+ olfactory sensory neurons. Additionally, we studied the case of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii that lives on undamaged ripe fruit with less SCFA production. Contrary to D. melanogaster, D. suzukii larvae show reduced attraction towards propionic acid, which does not trigger feeding behavior in this invasive species. Our results demonstrate the relevance of propionic acid as an orexigenic signal in D. melanogaster larvae. Moreover, this study underlines that the changes on ecological niche are accompanied with alterations of olfactory preferences and vital olfactory driven behaviors.",2017,"Ana Depetris-Chauvin, Diego Galagovsky, Charlene Chevalier, Gerard Maniere, Yael Grosjean"
Genomic signatures of local adaptation in the Drosophila immune response,28586288,10.1080/19336934.2017.1337612,"As environments and pathogen landscapes shift, host defenses must evolve to remain effective. Due to this selection pressure, among-species comparisons of genetic sequence data often find immune genes to be among the fastest evolving genes across the genome. The full extent and nature of these immune adaptations, however, remain largely unexplored. In a recent study, we analyzed patterns of selection within distinct components of the Drosophila melanogaster immune pathway. While we found evidence of positive selection within some immune processes, immune genes were not universally characterized by signatures of strong selection. On the contrary, we even found that some immune functions show greater than expected constraint. Overall these results highlight 2 major factors that appear to play an outsize role in determining a gene's evolutionary rate: the type of pathogen the gene targets and the gene's position within the immune network. These results join a growing body of literature that highlight the complexity of immune adaptation. Rather than there being uniformly strong selection across all immune genes, a combination of pathogen-specificity and host genetic constraints appear to play key roles in determining each immune gene's individual evolutionary trajectory.",2017,"Angela M Early, Andrew G Clark, Angela M Early, Andrew G Clark"

However, little is known about how these life-history responses are mediated. In this study, we compared adult female flies fed an alternating diet (yoyo flies) with flies fed a constant low (CL) or high (CH) diet and tested how whole genome expression was affected by these diet regimes and how the transcriptional responses related to different life-history traits. We showed that flies were able to respond quickly to diet fluctuations throughout life span by drastically changing their transcription. Importantly, by measuring the response of multiple life-history traits we were able to decouple groups of genes associated with life span or reproduction, life-history traits that often covary with a diet change. A coexpression network analysis uncovered which genes underpin the separate and shared regulation of these life-history traits.

Characterization of dFOXO binding sites upstream of the Insulin Receptor P2 promoter across the Drosophila phylogeny,29200426,10.1371/journal.pone.0188357,"The insulin/TOR signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in determining such important traits as body and organ size, metabolic homeostasis and life span. Although this pathway is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the affected traits can exhibit important differences even between closely related species. Evolutionary studies of regulatory regions require the reliable identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here we have focused on the Insulin Receptor (InR) expression from its P2 promoter in the Drosophila genus, which in D. melanogaster is up-regulated by hypophosphorylated Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO). We have finely characterized this transcription factor binding sites in vitro along the 1.3 kb region upstream of the InR P2 promoter in five Drosophila species. Moreover, we have tested the effect of mutations in the characterized dFOXO sites of D. melanogaster in transgenic flies. The number of experimentally established binding sites varies across the 1.3 kb region of any particular species, and their distribution also differs among species. In D. melanogaster, InR expression from P2 is differentially affected by dFOXO binding sites at the proximal and distal halves of the species 1.3 kb fragment. The observed uneven distribution of binding sites across this fragment might underlie their differential contribution to regulate InR transcription.",2017,"Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Elvira Juan, Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Elvira Juan"

The distribution of mutation effects on viability in Drosophila melanogaster,7896110,,"Parameters of continuous distributions of effects and rates of spontaneous mutation for relative viability in Drosophila are estimated by maximum likelihood from data of two published experiments on accumulation of mutations on protected second chromosomes. A model of equal mutant effects gives a poor fit to the data of the two experiments; higher likelihoods are obtained with leptokurtic distributions or for models in which there is more than one class of mutation effect. Minimum estimates of mutation rates (events per generation) at polygenes affecting viability on chromosome 2 are 0.14 and 0.068, but estimates are strongly confounded with other parameters in the model. Separate information on rates of molecular divergence between Drosophila species and from rates of movement of transposable elements is used to infer the overall genomic mutation rate in Drosophila, and the viability data are analyzed with mutation rate as a known parameter. If, for example, a mutation rate for chromosome 2 of 0.4 is assumed, maximum likelihood estimates of mean mutant effect on relative viability are 0.4% and 1%, but the majority of mutations have very much smaller effects than these values as distributions are highly leptokurtic. The methodology is applied to estimate viability effects of single P element insertional mutations. The mean effect per insertion is found to be higher, and their distribution is found to be less leptokurtic than for spontaneous mutations. The equilibrium genetic variance of viability predicted by a mutation-selection balance model with parameters estimated from the mutation accumulation experiments is similar to laboratory estimates of genetic variance of viability from natural populations of Drosophila.",1994,"P D Keightley, P D Keightley"
The Drosophila micropia retrotransposon encodes a testis-specific antisense RNA complementary to reverse transcriptase,7509447,10.1128/mcb.14.3.1764,"The micropia transposable element of Drosophila hydei is a long terminal repeat-containing retrotransposon present in both the autosomes and the Y chromosome. micropia expression gives rise to a complex set of sense and antisense RNAs transcribed primarily during spermatogenesis. The most abundant sense RNAs constitute an assortment of heterogeneous high-molecular-weight transcripts expressed as constituents of the Y-chromosomal lampbrush loops of primary spermatocytes. In addition, micropia encodes a full-length RNA that extends between the two long terminal repeats of the element. The major 1.0-kb antisense RNA characterized is complementary to the reverse transcriptase and RNase H coding regions of micropia. It is expressed from a testis-specific promoter during the primary spermatocyte stages and is detectable until spermatid elongation stages. Sequence comparison of this promoter with the 5' region of other testis-specific genes allows the conception of a conserved sequence that is responsible for this pattern of expression. A 284-bp fragment containing this sequence is able to drive testis-specific expression of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This sequence is conserved in the micropia elements present in other Drosophila species that also encode an antisense RNA. The evolutionary conservation of micropia antisense RNA expression and the sequences responsible for its testis-specific transcription suggests a role for this antisense RNA in the control of germ line expression of the full-length transcript or transposon-encoded proteins.",1994,"S Lankenau, V G Corces, D H Lankenau, S Lankenau, V G Corces, D H Lankenau"
Gross chromosome rearrangements mediated by transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster,8031304,10.1002/bies.950160410,"A combination of cytogenetic and molecular analyses has shown that several different transposable elements are involved in the restructuring of Drosophila chromosomes. Two kinds of elements, P and hobo, are especially prone to induce chromosome rearrangements. The mechanistic details of this process are unclear, but, at least some of the time, it seems to involve ectopic recombination between elements inserted at different chromosomal sites; the available data suggest that these ectopic recombination events are much more likely to occur between elements in the same chromosome than between elements in different chromosomes. Other Drosophila transposons also appear to mediate chromosome restructuring by ectopic recombination; these include the retrotransposons BEL, roo, Doc and I and the foldback element FB. In addition, two retrotransposons, HeT-A and TART, have been found to be associated specifically with the ends of Drosophila chromosomes. Very limited data indicate that transposon-mediated chromosome restructuring is occurring in natural populations of Drosophila.

Regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila melanogaster varies with feeding regime and nutritional state,7852903,,"The regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila melanogaster includes such elements as ingestion responsiveness, volume ingested in a single meal, food storage in the crop and rate of defecation. Our results suggest that feeding behavior varies in a manner dependent on feeding regime (food-deprived or ad-libitum-fed) and nutritional state. Fed flies that are subsequently food-deprived become increasingly more responsive to food stimuli over time and, when offered 1% agar diets containing different concentrations of sucrose, ingest greater amounts of diets that have higher sucrose concentrations. When fed ad libitum for 72 h on these same diets, D. melanogaster maintained much smaller crops on average than food-deprived flies fed a single meal. Additionally, ad-libitum-fed flies are grouped into two categories depending on the concentration of sucrose in the diet. Flies fed for 72 h on 1% agar diets having 50 mmoll-1 sucrose or more are not affected by the concentration of sucrose in the diet, while flies fed on diets of 15 or 25 mmoll-1 sucrose increase ingestion responsiveness, crop size and the rate of defecation with decreasing concentrations of sucrose in the diet. Flies fed on even lower sucrose concentrations (5 or 10 mmoll-1 sucrose) for 27-72 h exhibit both a shift over time to larger crop sizes and increased mortality over those of flies fed 15 mmoll-1 sucrose.

Retrotransposon-induced ectopic expression of cut causes the Om(1A) mutant in Drosophila ananassae,8056307,,"Optic morphology (Om) mutations in Drosophila ananassae map to at least 22 loci scattered throughout the genome.

Three of the eight alleles of Om(1A) examined have insertion of the tom element within a putative cut region. The gamma-ray-induced revertants of Om(1A) are accompanied with cut lethal mutations and rearrangements within the cut coding region. In the eye imaginal discs of the Om(1A) mutants, differentiation of photoreceptor clusters is suppressed, abnormal cell death occurs in the center and the cut protein is expressed ectopically. D. melanogaster flies transformed with a chimeric cut gene under the control of a heat-inducible promoter show excessive cell death in the region anterior to the morphogenetic furrow, suppressed differentiation to photoreceptor clusters and defect in the imaginal eye morphology when subjected to temperature elevation. These findings suggest that the tom element inserted within the Om(1A) region induces ectopic cut expression in the eye imaginal discs, thus resulting in the Om(1A) mutant phenotype.",1994,"T Awasaki, N Juni, T Hamabata, K Yoshida, M Matsuda, Y N Tobari, S H Hori, T Awasaki, N Juni, T Hamabata, K Yoshida, M Matsuda, Y N Tobari, S H Hori"

Transgenic Drosophila melanogaster flies carrying an additional copy of the EF-1 alpha gene under control of a heat-inducible promoter have an extended lifespan, further indicating that the EF-1 alpha gene may play an important role in determining longevity. To test this hypothesis, we have quantitated EF-1 alpha mRNA, EF-1 alpha protein, and the EF-1 alpha complex-formation activity in these transgenic flies. Furthermore, we have tested whether the transgene construct is functional--i.e., whether transgenic mRNA is induced when flies are grown at higher temperature. The results show that although there is a clear difference in mean lifespan between the EF-1 alpha transgenic (E) flies and the control transgenic (C) flies, E flies do not express more EF-1 alpha protein or mRNA than C flies kept at the same experimental conditions. Although the transgene can be induced when E flies are heat-shocked at 37 degrees C, transgenic mRNA is not detectable in E flies aged at 29 degrees C. In both lines, the loss in catalytic activity with age is the same. We conclude that the E flies examined here do not live longer because of overexpressing the EF-1 alpha gene.",1994,"N Shikama, R Ackermann, C Brack, N Shikama, R Ackermann, C Brack"

Of the 1063 nucleotides examined, two synonymous sites were polymorphic and no amino acid variation was detected. Three statistical tests were used to detect departures from an equilibrium neutral model. Two tests failed to reject a neutral model of molecular evolution because of low statistical power associated with low levels of genetic variation (Tajima/Fu and Li). The Hudson, Kreitman, and Aguade test rejected a neutral model when the tra region was compared to the 5'-flanking region of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh). The lack of variability in the tra gene is consistent with a recent selective sweep of a beneficial allele in or near the tra locus.",1994,"C S Walthour, S W Schaeffer, C S Walthour, S W Schaeffer"
The basis for germline specificity of the hobo transposable element in Drosophila melanogaster,8157003,,"Previous results suggested that the hobo transposable element is active predominantly in the germline of Drosophila. We investigate germline restriction of hobo transposition by testing in vitro modified elements for their ability to mobilize marked elements in vivo. Although intact hobo elements are germline specific, an hsp70 promoter-hobo transposase fusion is active in the soma. Analysis of the hsp70-promoted transcript does not provide evidence for splicing. Moreover, the hobo promoter confers germline bias to a highly sensitive reporter, delta 2-3 P transposase. These results indicate that hobo transposition is germline specific due to regulation of transposase production at the level of transcription. Thus, although hobo is similar to the P transposable element in organization and tissue specificity, it differs in the underlying mechanism governing germline specific activity.",1994,"B R Calvi, W M Gelbart, B R Calvi, W M Gelbart"
Egalitarian and the choice of cell fates in Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,7835153,,"Oogenesis in Drosophila females begins with the formation of a cyst of 16 interconnected sister cells, one of which eventually becomes the definitive oocyte. The other 15 become nurse cells, performing nutritive roles for the oocyte. There are four alternative developmental pathways in each cyst: winning pro-oocyte, losing pro-oocyte and cells with three ring canals, all of which enter meiosis, and the twelve obligate pro-nurse cells, which do not. In flies homozygous for the female-sterile mutation egalitarian (egl) all 16 cells follow the same intermediate pathway. All nuclei enter meiosis (shown by their attainment of synaptonemal complex of at least mid-zygotene levels and by their attainment of pachytene numbers and locations of recombination nodules), then all exit it and become morphologically indistinguishable from nurse cells in wild-type flies. The wild-type allele of egl therefore performs two active but opposite roles in cell fate choice. Early on it is necessary for inhibition of meiotic entry in the 'obligate' pro-nurse cells; later it is necessary for meiotic maintenance in the 'winning' pro-oocyte. One can account for both roles from a single function by invoking gradients through the early cyst; the egl+ function appears to be required for the normal function of these gradients.",1994,"A T Carpenter, A T Carpenter"
Delta-notch signaling and Drosophila cell fate choice,7813766,10.1006/dbio.1994.1326,"Delta and Notch encode cell surface proteins that function in a wide variety of cell fate specification events during oogenesis, embryogenesis, and metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster. Various lines of evidence imply that Delta and Notch proteins function as signal and receptor in cellular interactions required for the partitioning of fates among cells within equivalence groups in many developmental contexts. Molecular and genetic observations provide a framework for the formulation of hypotheses concerning the mechanisms by which the Delta ligand and Notch receptor interact and the Delta-Notch signal is transduced in a manner that can affect the adoption of distinct fates by different cells. In particular, emerging evidence regarding the expression and function of Delta and Notch during development also raise possible alternatives to the currently favored hypothesis that Delta-Notch interactions generate instructive signals that mediate a process termed lateral inhibition.",1994,"M A Muskavitch, M A Muskavitch"

We examined the complex array of internal structures of the embryonic Drosophila melanogaster head such as the sensory structures and nerves of the peripheral and stomatogastric nervous systems, and we used embryonic head mutations causing a lack of overlapping segment anlagen to unravel the segmental identity and the sequence of the neural elements. Our results provide evidence for seven distinct segments in the Drosophila head, each characterized by a specific set of sensory neurons, consistent with the proposal that insects, myriapods, and crustaceans share a monophyletic evolutionary tree from a common annelid-like ancestor.",1994,"U Schmidt-Ott, M GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n, H JÃ¤ckle, G M Technau, U Schmidt-Ott, M GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n, H JÃ¤ckle, G M Technau"

Interspecific comparisons reveal conserved features of the Drosophila Toll protein,8112609,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90760-9,"The Toll gene of Drosophila melanogaster produces a transmembrane cell adhesion protein that is required to establish the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo.

Here, we report amino-acid (aa) sequences encoded by the Toll genes of D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis, and two distinct Toll-like genes of the grasshopper, Schistocerca americana. Interspecific comparisons show a Toll-specific subfamily of LRR, and a strikingly high degree of conservation in the cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, many aa residues conserved among the insect Toll-like cytoplasmic domains are also conserved in mammalian and avian type-I interleukin-1 receptors and the hypothetical product of a transcript, MyD88, found in murine myeloid cells. Thus, we identify a set of conserved aa in the cytoplasmic domain which might be used in a signal-transduction pathway shared by invertebrates and vertebrates.",1994,"M Yamagata, J P Merlie, J R Sanes, M Yamagata, J P Merlie, J R Sanes"

The Drosophila homeotic mutation Nasobemia (AntpNs) and its revertants: an analysis of mutational reversion,7851768,,"The homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) controls determination of many different cell types in the thorax and abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster. The spontaneous mutant allele Nasobemia (AntpNs) and its revertants have been widely used to infer normal Antp gene function but have not themselves been thoroughly characterized. Our analysis reveals that AntpNs consists of an internal 25-kb partial duplication of the Antp gene as well as a complex insertion of > 40 kb of new DNA including two roo transposons. The duplication gives the mutant gene three Antp promoters, and transcripts from each of these are correctly processed to yield functional ANTP proteins. At least two of the promoters are ectopically active in the eye-antenna imaginal discs, leading to homeotic transformation of the adult head. A molecular and genetic description of several AntpNs revertants shows them to be diverse in structure and activity, including a restoration of the wild type, rearrangements separating two of the AntpNs promoters from the coding sequences, and protein nulls and hypomorphs affecting expression from all three of the promoters. Finally, one revertant has a suppressing lesion in the osa locus far away from Antp. These features explain the unusual homozygous viable nature of AntpNs, suggest a mechanism by which its homeotic transformation occurs, and exemplify the diversity of ways in which mutational reversion can take place.",1994,"P B Talbert, R L Garber, P B Talbert, R L Garber"
"Cloning, expression, and localization of a chloride-facilitated, cocaine-sensitive serotonin transporter from Drosophila melanogaster",8197200,10.1073/pnas.91.11.5158,"We report here on the isolation and characterization of a serotonin (5HT) transporter from Drosophila melanogaster. A 3.1-kb complementary DNA clone (dSERT) was found to encode a protein of 622 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 69 kDa and a putative transmembrane topology characteristic of cloned members of the mammalian Na+/Cl- neurotransmitter cotransporter gene family. dSERT displays highest overall amino acid sequence identity with the mammalian 5HT (51%), norepinephrine (47%), and dopamine (47%) transporters and shares with all transporters 104 absolutely conserved amino acid residues. Upon transient expression in HeLa cells, dSERT exhibited saturable, high-affinity, and sodium-dependent [3H]5HT uptake with estimated Km and Vmax values of approximately 500 nM and 5.2 x 10(-18) mol per cell per min, respectively. In marked contrast to the human SERT (hSERT), 5HT-mediated transport by dSERT was not absolutely dependent on extracellular Cl-, while the sodium-dependent uptake of 5HT was facilitated by increased extracellular Cl- concentrations. dSERT displays a pharmacological profile and rank order of potency consistent with, but not identical to, mammalian 5HT transporters. Comparison of the affinities of various compounds for the inhibition of 5HT transport by both dSERT and hSERT revealed that antidepressants were 3- to 300-fold less potent on dSERT than on hSERT, while mazindol displayed approximately 30-fold greater potency for dSERT. Both cocaine and RTI-55 inhibited 5HT uptake by dSERT with estimated inhibition constants of approximately 500 nM, while high concentrations (> 10 microM) of dopamine, norepinephrine, octopamine, tyramine, and histamine failed to inhibit transport. In situ hybridization reveals the selective expression of dSERT mRNA to specific cell bodies in the ventral ganglion of the embryonic and larval Drosophila nervous system with a distribution pattern virtually identical to that of 5HT-containing neurons. The dSERT gene was mapped to position 60C on chromosome 2. The availability of the gene encoding the unique ion dependence and pharmacological characteristics of dSERT may allow for identification of those amino acid residues and structural motifs that confer the pharmacologic specificity and genetic regulation of the 5HT transport process.",1994,"L L Demchyshyn, Z B Pristupa, K S Sugamori, E L Barker, R D Blakely, W J Wolfgang, M A Forte, H B Niznik, L L Demchyshyn, Z B Pristupa, K S Sugamori, E L Barker, R D Blakely, W J Wolfgang, M A Forte, H B Niznik"
A Drosophila gene promoter is subject to glucose repression in yeast cells,7526389,10.1073/pnas.91.23.11109,"Previous work has shown that the alpha-amylase gene of Drosophila melanogaster is subject to repression by dietary glucose. Moreover, glucose repression of this gene is mediated by promoter elements that lie upstream of the transcriptional start site. In this study, we examined the activity of the glucose-repressible Drosophila promoter in transformed yeast cells. We show that the amylase promoter region can mediate glucose repression of a heterologous reporter gene in yeast. The implication of this result is that the yeast regulatory machinery can recognize the Drosophila promoter signals. This, in turn, implies an unexpectedly high degree of evolutionary conservation in the mechanism of glucose repression among eukaryotes. It also shows that genes that have acquired complex patterns of developmental regulation-e.g., the Drosophila amylase gene, can still retain, intact, more primitive forms of regulation, such as glucose repression.",1994,"D A Hickey, K I Benkel, Y Fong, B F Benkel, D A Hickey, K I Benkel, Y Fong, B F Benkel"

The infection status of 266 lines from 12 populations along the eastern coast of Australia was determined by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining of embryos. All populations contained both infected and uninfected flies. Infection frequencies varied between populations but there was no discernible geographical pattern. Laboratory experiments indicated that the infection was not associated with a reduction in fecundity as in Drosophila simulans. Incompatibility levels could not be increased by laboratory selection on isofemale lines.

With a view to discovering whether the inactive mutation impairs learning, I describe the effect of the inactive mutation on experience-dependent courtship modification (EDCM). Wild-type males rapidly condition to immature males and modify their behaviour toward subsequent target flies. The weaker EDCM phenotype of inactive males is similar to that of dunce males. Using time-sampling, habituation is most rapid for wild-type males and slowest for dunce males, with inactive males showing an intermediate phenotype. These results support the notion that octopamine plays a significant role in the manifestation of Drosophila learning behavior.",1994,"K M O'Dell, K M O'Dell"
P element transformation vectors for studying Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis and early embryogenesis,8125300,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90804-4,"We have constructed six new P-element-based Drosophila melanogaster transformation vectors that specifically allow for the high-level accumulation of any RNA of interest in the developing egg and pre-blastoderm embryo. Such specificity results, in part, from the inclusion in the vectors of an enhancer active exclusively in nurse cells, the principal providers of RNA to the egg and early embryo. The nurse cell enhancer was derived from the hsp26 heat-shock (HS) gene, but its activity was neither dependent on nor sensitive to HS. In addition to the nurse cell enhancer, two of the vectors contain sequences from the K10 gene that promote the early transfer of RNAs from nurse cells into the oocyte; RNAs that contain the K10 sequence are transferred into the oocyte during the early to middle stages of oogenesis (i.e., during stages 2-9), while RNAs that lack such sequences are stored in nurse cells until stage 11. All of the vectors contain a tsp and a multiple cloning site (MCS) immediately downstream from the hsp26 nurse cell enhancer. In three of the vectors, the MCS is preceded by an ATG start codon. A wild-type copy of the white gene is included in all of the vectors as a selectable marker for transformation.

The evolution of abdominal reduction and the recent origin of distinct Abdominal-B transcript classes in Diptera,16686635,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00095.x,"In insects, the Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) governs the development of the posterior-most segments, the number and fate of which differ within and between orders. A striking feature of insect evolution is a trend toward the reduction of posterior abdominal segments which is most pronounced in higher Diptera. In Drosophila melanogaster, two distinct Abd-B transcript classes and protein isoforms are expressed in non-overlapping domains and have discrete functions in patterning the posterior abdomen. It has been proposed that evolutionary changes in Abd-B structure and expression are responsible for the reduction of the dipteran abdomen. We have investigated the relationship between the evolution of the Abd-B gene and abdominal reduction by analyzing the structure and expression of homologs from four additional dipterans representing distinct clades within the order. The lower dipteran mosquito Anopheles gambiae expresses a single Abd-B transcript class, as do two species phylogenetically intermediate to mosquitoes and drosophilids. These results delimit the evolution of distinct functional Abd-B isoforms to within the dipteran radiation after the origin of the reduced abdominal morphology. Furthermore, we found that the spatial distribution of Abd-B transcripts in non-drosophilid Diptera is identical to the combined domains of the two D. melanogaster Abd-B transcripts. Therefore, neither the structural evolution nor changes in the spatial regulation of Abd-B account for the derived abdomen of higher Diptera. The recent subfunctionalization of this Hox gene has occurred without any apparent morphological correlate. We conclude that regulatory modifications to developmental programs downstream of or parallel to Abd-B are responsible for the evolutionary reduction of the higher dipteran postabdomen.",2006,"John H Yoder, Sean B Carroll, John H Yoder, Sean B Carroll"

Drosophila SPF45: a bifunctional protein with roles in both splicing and DNA repair,17154718,10.1371/journal.pgen.0020178,"The sequence of the SPF45 protein is significantly conserved, yet functional studies have identified it as a splicing factor in animal cells and as a DNA-repair protein in plants. Using a combined genetic and biochemical approach to investigate this apparent functional discrepancy, we unify and validate both of these studies by demonstrating that the Drosophila melanogaster protein is bifunctional, with independent functions in DNA repair and splicing. We find that SPF45 associates with the U2 snRNP and that mutations that remove the C-terminal end of the protein disrupt this interaction. Although animals carrying this mutation are viable, they are nevertheless compromised in their ability to regulate Sex-lethal splicing, demonstrating that Sex-lethal is an important physiological target of SPF45. Furthermore, these mutant animals exhibit phenotypes diagnostic of difficulties in recovering from exogenously induced DNA damage. The conclusion that SPF45 functions in the DNA-repair pathway is strengthened by finding both genetic and physical interactions between SPF45 and RAD201, a previously uncharacterized member of the RecA/Rad51 protein family. Together with our finding that the fly SPF45 protein increases the survival rate of mutagen-treated bacteria lacking the RecG helicase, these studies provide the tantalizing suggestion that SPF45 has an ancient and evolutionarily conserved role in DNA repair.",2006,"Ahmad Sami Chaouki, Helen K Salz, Ahmad Sami Chaouki, Helen K Salz"
The bHLH transcription factor Hand is regulated by Alk in the Drosophila embryonic gut,17094947,10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.10.117,"During embryonic development the midgut visceral muscle is formed by fusion of cells within the visceral mesoderm, a process initiated by the specification of a specialised cell type, the founder cell, within this tissue.

In this paper, we have investigated downstream components which are regulated by this novel signalling pathway. Here we show that Alk-mediated signal transduction drives the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand in vivo. Loss of Alk function results in a complete lack of Hand expression in this tissue, whereas Alk gain of function results in an expansion of Hand expression.

Mechanisms underlying the sperm quality advantage in Drosophila melanogaster,17133863,,"Contrary to early predictions of sperm competition theory, postcopulatory sexual selection favoring increased investment per sperm (e.g., sperm size, sperm quality) has been demonstrated in numerous organisms. We empirically demonstrate for Drosophila melanogaster that both sperm quality and sperm quantity independently contribute to competitive male fertilization success. In addition to these independent effects, there was a significant interaction between sperm quality and quantity that suggests an internal positive reinforcement on selection for sperm quality, with selection predicted to intensify as investment per sperm increases and the number of sperm competing declines. The mechanism underlying the sperm quality advantage is elucidated through examination of the relationship between female sperm-storage organ morphology and the differential organization of different length sperm within the organ.

There are two clades of GABA receptor subunits that include both vertebrate and invertebrate orthologues. In addition, I identified nine clades of anion channel subunits found only in invertebrates, including three that are specific to C. elegans and two found only in Drosophila. One well-defined clade of vertebrate cation channel subunits, the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (nAChR), includes invertebrate orthologues. There are two clades of invertebrate nAChRs, one of alpha-type subunits and one of non-alpha subunits, that are most similar to the two clades of vertebrate neuronal and muscle alpha and non-alpha subunits. There is a large group of divergent C. elegans nAChR-like subunits partially resolved into clades but no orthologues of 5HT3-type serotonin receptors in the invertebrates. The topology of the trees suggests that most of the invertebrate-specific Cys-loop LGIC clades were present in the common ancestor of chordates and ecdysozoa.

Global analysis of X-chromosome dosage compensation,16507155,10.1186/jbiol30,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster females have two X chromosomes and two autosome sets (XX;AA), while males have a single X chromosome and two autosome sets (X;AA). Drosophila male somatic cells compensate for a single copy of the X chromosome by deploying male-specific-lethal (MSL) complexes that increase transcription from the X chromosome. Male germ cells lack MSL complexes, indicating that either germline X-chromosome dosage compensation is MSL-independent, or that germ cells do not carry out dosage compensation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To investigate whether dosage compensation occurs in germ cells, we directly assayed X-chromosome transcripts using DNA microarrays and show equivalent expression in XX;AA and X;AA germline tissues. In X;AA germ cells, expression from the single X chromosome is about twice that of a single autosome. This mechanism ensures balanced X-chromosome expression between the sexes and, more importantly, it ensures balanced expression between the single X chromosome and the autosome set. Oddly, the inactivation of an X chromosome in mammalian females reduces the effective X-chromosome dose and means that females face the same X-chromosome transcript deficiency as males. Contrary to most current dosage-compensation models, we also show increased X-chromosome expression in X;AA and XX;AA somatic cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Drosophila germ cells compensate for X-chromosome dose. This occurs by equilibrating X-chromosome and autosome expression in X;AA cells.

In transgenic mice, typical neuropathologic inclusions formed concomitant with behavioral deficits, reminiscent of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Neuronal degeneration was cell-autonomous in the Lewy body disease models, whereas gliotic changes accompanied neurodegeneration caused by (oligodendro)glial cytoplasmic inclusions.

Phylogeny of the sex-determining gene Sex-lethal in insects,16604108,10.1139/g05-107,"The Sex-lethal (SXL) protein belongs to the family of RNA-binding proteins and is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. SXL has undergone an obvious change of function during the evolution of the insect clade. The gene has acquired a pivotal role in the sex-determining pathway of Drosophila, although it does not act as a sex determiner in non-drosophilids. We collected SXL sequences of insect species ranging from the pea aphid (Acyrtho siphom pisum) to Drosophila melanogaster by searching published articles, sequencing cDNAs, and exploiting homology searches in public EST and whole-genome databases. The SXL protein has moderately conserved N- and C-terminal regions and a well-conserved central region including 2 RNA recognition motifs. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that a single orthologue of the Drosophila Sex-lethal (Sxl) gene is present in the genomes of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the honeybee Apis mellifera, the silkworm Bombyx mori, and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. The D. melanogaster, D. erecta, and D. pseudoobscura genomes, however, contain 2 paralogous genes, Sxl and CG3056, which are orthologous to the Anopheles, Apis, Bombyx, and Tribolium Sxl. Hence, a duplication in the fly clade generated Sxl and CG3056. Our hypothesis maintains that one of the genes, Sxl, adopted the new function of sex determiner in Drosophila, whereas the other, CG3056, continued to serve some or all of the yet-unknown ancestral functions.",2006,"Walther Traut, Teruyuki Niimi, Kazuho Ikeo, Ken Sahara, Walther Traut, Teruyuki Niimi, Kazuho Ikeo, Ken Sahara"
The association between inversion In(3R)Payne and clinally varying traits in Drosophila melanogaster,17028965,10.1007/s10709-006-7375-7,"In Drosophila melanogaster, inversion In(3R)Payne increases in frequency towards low latitudes and has been putatively associated with variation in size and thermal resistance, traits that also vary clinally. To assess the association between size and inversion, we obtained isofemale lines of inverted and standard karyotype of In(3R)Payne from the ends of the Australian D. melanogaster east coast cline. In the northern population, there was a significant association between In(3R)Payne and body size, with standard lines from this population being relatively larger than inverted lines. In contrast, the inversion had no influence on development time or cold resistance. We strengthened our findings further in a separate study with flies from populations from the middle of the cline as well as from the cline ends. These flies were scored for wing size and the presence of In(3R)Payne using a molecular marker. In females, the inversion accounted for around 30% of the size difference between cline ends, while in males the equivalent figure was 60%. Adaptive shifts in size but not in the other traits are therefore likely to have involved genes closely associated with In(3R)Payne. Because the size difference between karyotypes was similar in different populations, there was no evidence for coadaptation within populations.",2006,"L Rako, A R Anderson, C M SgrÃ², A J Stocker, A A Hoffmann, L Rako, A R Anderson, C M SgrÃ², A J Stocker, A A Hoffmann"
Expression of the UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase family is spatially and temporally regulated during Drosophila development,16251381,10.1093/glycob/cwj051,"The UDP-GalNAc : polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (ppGaNTase or ppGalNAcT or pgant) enzyme family is responsible for the first committed step in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans on protein substrates. Previous work from our group has demonstrated both sequence and functional conservation between members of this family in mammals and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. One member of this family in Drosophila has been shown to be essential for viability and development. In an effort to understand the developmental stages and processes in which O-glycosylation is involved, we have determined the expression pattern of each functional family member as well as putative isoforms during Drosophila development. Our studies indicate that isoforms are expressed in discrete spatial and temporal fashions during development, with some isoforms being found uniquely in restricted areas of the developing embryo (brain, trachea, pharynx, esophagus, proventriculus, and amnioserosa), whereas others are found in multiple regions and overlap with the expression of other isoforms (salivary glands, posterior midgut, anterior midgut, and the fore-/hindgut) during embryogenesis. Additionally, we examined expression patterns in imaginal discs from third instar larvae, which will become the adult structures. Most isoforms are also expressed in the imaginal discs, with some showing unique transcript localization and spatial regulatory control. Thus, this report provides insight into the specific regions during Drosophila development that may require O-linked glycosylation in vivo as well as which isoforms may act cooperatively in certain tissues and which may be uniquely responsible for glycosylation in others.",2006,"E Tian, Kelly G Ten Hagen, E Tian, Kelly G Ten Hagen"
Drosophila melanogaster gamma-TuRC is dispensable for targeting gamma-tubulin to the centrosome and microtubule nucleation,16476773,10.1083/jcb.200511071,"In metazoans, gamma-tubulin acts within two main complexes, gamma-tubulin small complexes (gamma-TuSCs) and gamma-tubulin ring complexes (gamma-TuRCs). In higher eukaryotes, it is assumed that microtubule nucleation at the centrosome depends on gamma-TuRCs, but the role of gamma-TuRC components remains undefined. For the first time, we analyzed the function of all four gamma-TuRC-specific subunits in Drosophila melanogaster: Dgrip75, Dgrip128, Dgrip163, and Dgp71WD. Grip-motif proteins, but not Dgp71WD, appear to be required for gamma-TuRC assembly. Individual depletion of gamma-TuRC components, in cultured cells and in vivo, induces mitotic delay and abnormal spindles. Surprisingly, gamma-TuSCs are recruited to the centrosomes. These defects are less severe than those resulting from the inhibition of gamma-TuSC components and do not appear critical for viability. Simultaneous cosilencing of all gamma-TuRC proteins leads to stronger phenotypes and partial recruitment of gamma-TuSC. In conclusion, gamma-TuRCs are required for assembly of fully functional spindles, but we suggest that gamma-TuSC could be targeted to the centrosomes, which is where basic microtubule assembly activities are maintained.",2006,"Christel VÃ©rollet, Nathalie ColombiÃ©, Thomas Daubon, Henri-Marc Bourbon, Michel Wright, Brigitte Raynaud-Messina, Christel VÃ©rollet, Nathalie ColombiÃ©, Thomas Daubon, Henri-Marc Bourbon, Michel Wright, Brigitte Raynaud-Messina"
"Environmental stress and reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster: starvation resistance, ovariole numbers and early age egg production",16848899,10.1186/1471-2148-6-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      The Y model of resource allocation predicts a tradeoff between reproduction and survival. Environmental stress could affect a tradeoff between reproduction and survival, but the physiological mechanisms underlying environmental mediation of the tradeoff are largely unknown. One example is the tradeoff between starvation resistance and early fecundity. One goal of the present study was to determine if reduced early age fecundity was indeed a robust indirect response to selection for starvation resistance, by investigation of a set of D. melanogaster starvation selected lines which had not previously been characterized for age specific egg production. Another goal of the present study was to investigate a possible relationship between ovariole number and starvation resistance. Ovariole number is correlated with maximum daily fecundity in outbred D. melanogaster. Thus, one might expect that a negative genetic correlation between starvation resistance and early fecundity would be accompanied by a decrease in ovariole number.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Selection for early age female starvation resistance favored survival under food deprivation conditions apparently at the expense of early age egg production. The total number of eggs produced by females from selected and control lines was approximately the same for the first 26 days of life, but the timing of egg production differed such that selected females produced fewer eggs early in adult life. Females from lines selected for female starvation resistance exhibited a greater number of ovarioles than did unselected lines. Moreover, maternal starvation resulted in progeny with a greater number of ovarioles in both selected and unselected lines.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Reduced early age egg production is a robust response to laboratory selection for starvation survival. Ovariole numbers increased in response to selection for female starvation resistance indicating that ovariole number does not account for reduced early age egg production. Further, ovariole number increased in a parallel response to maternal starvation, suggesting an evolutionary association between maternal environment and the reproductive system of female progeny.",2006,"Marta L Wayne, Usha Soundararajan, Lawrence G Harshman, Marta L Wayne, Usha Soundararajan, Lawrence G Harshman"
Retrogene movement within- and between-chromosomes in the evolution of Drosophila genomes,17101240,10.1016/j.gene.2006.04.033,"Recent genomic analyses in Drosophila and mammals of inter-chromosomal retroposition have revealed that during evolution the retroposed genes that show male-biased expression tend to leave the X chromosome and opt for autosomal positions. Such a phenomenon may be a process of general, genomic and evolutionary relevance. It contributed to the unexpected overrepresentation of male-biased genes on the autosomes recently observed in microarray expression experiments. In this paper, we report our genomic analysis of within-chromosomal retroposition in Drosophila melanogaster, and compare it with the previously identified pattern of the between-chromosomal retroposition. We find that a surfeit of autosomal retroposed genes originated from parental genes located on the same chromosome, in contrast to the X chromosome in which only few genes retroposed in cis. Such an autosomal proximity effect implicates a role of the mutation process for retroposition in determining chromosomal locations of autosome-derived retroposed genes. Furthermore, this phenomenon supports the hypothesis that natural selection favors the retroposition of genes out of the X chromosome. Analyses of a large expression database for D. melanogaster genes revealed that the vast majority of the X-derived autosomal retroposed genes had evolved testis expression functions, consistent with other previous genomic analyses.",2006,"Hongzheng Dai, Toshio F Yoshimatsu, Manyuan Long, Hongzheng Dai, Toshio F Yoshimatsu, Manyuan Long"
Genetic variation in Drosophila melanogaster resistance to infection: a comparison across bacteria,16888344,10.1534/genetics.105.054593,"Insects use a generalized immune response to combat bacterial infection. We have previously noted that natural populations of D. melanogaster harbor substantial genetic variation for antibacterial immunocompetence and that much of this variation can be mapped to genes that are known to play direct roles in immunity. It was not known, however, whether the phenotypic effects of variation in these genes are general across the range of potentially infectious bacteria. To address this question, we have reinfected the same set of D. melanogaster lines with Serratia marcescens, the bacterium used in the previous study, and with three additional bacteria that were isolated from the hemolymph of wild-caught D. melanogaster. Two of the new bacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Lactococcus lactis, are gram positive. The third, Providencia burhodogranaria, is gram negative like S. marcescens. Drosophila genotypes vary highly significantly in bacterial load sustained after infection with each of the four bacteria, but mean loads are largely uncorrelated across bacteria. We have tested statistical associations between immunity phenotypes and nucleotide polymorphism in 21 candidate immunity genes. We find that molecular variation in some genes, such as Tehao, contributes to phenotypic variation in the suppression of only a subset of the pathogens. Variation in SR-CII and 18-wheeler, however, has effects that are more general. Although markers in SR-CII and 18-wheeler explain >20% of the phenotypic variation in resistance to L. lactis and E. faecalis, respectively, most of the molecular polymorphisms tested explain <10% of the total variance in bacterial load sustained after infection.",2006,"Brian P Lazzaro, Timothy B Sackton, Andrew G Clark, Brian P Lazzaro, Timothy B Sackton, Andrew G Clark"

To identify the biochemical reaction catalyzed by tafazzin, we expressed the full-length isoform of Drosophila melanogaster tafazzin in a baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell system. Tafazzin expression induced a new enzymatic function in Sf9 cell mitochondria, namely 1-palmitoyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine:monolysocardiolipin linoleoyltransferase. We also found evidence for the reverse reaction, because tafazzin expression caused transfer of acyl groups from phospholipids to 1-[14C]palmitoyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine. An affinity-purified tafazzin construct, tagged with the maltose-binding protein, catalyzed both forward and reverse transacylations between cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine, but was unable to utilize CoA or acyl-CoA as substrates. Whereas tafazzin supported transacylations between various phospholipid-lysophospholipid pairs, it showed the highest rate for the phosphatidylcholine-cardiolipin transacylation. Transacylation activities were about 10-fold higher for linoleoyl groups than for oleoyl groups, and they were negligible for arachidonoyl groups. The data show that Drosophila tafazzin is a CoA-independent, acyl-specific phospholipid transacylase with substrate preference for cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine.",2006,"Yang Xu, Ashim Malhotra, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame, Yang Xu, Ashim Malhotra, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame"

We have studied some of the ProtoBee findings and suggest their biological relevance. Examples include novel opsin genes and intriguing nuclear matches of mitochondrial genes. The organization of bee sequences into functional clusters suggests a natural way of automatically inferring functional annotation.

Comparing thyroid and insect hormone signaling,21672784,10.1093/icb/icl034,"Transitions between different states of development, physiology, and life history are typically mediated by hormones.

In vertebrates and some marine invertebrates, the lipophilic thyroid hormones (THs) affect metamorphosis and other life history transitions. Interestingly, when applied to insects, THs can physiologically mimic many facets of JH action, suggesting that the molecular actions of THs and JH/20E might be similar. Here we discuss functional parallels between TH and JH/20E signaling in insects, with a particular focus on the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a genetically and physiologically tractable model system.

Maintenance of transposable element copy number in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,9440269,,"To investigate the main forces controlling the containment of transposable elements (TE) in natural populations, we analyzed the copia, mdg1, and 412 elements in various populations of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. A lower proportion of insertion sites on the X chromosome in comparison with the autosomes suggests that selection against the detrimental effects of TE insertions is the major force containing TE copies in populations of Drosophila. This selection effect hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of the negative correlation between recombinaiton rate and TE copy number along the chromosomes, which was expected under the alternative ectopic exchange model (selection against the deleterious rearrangements promoted by recombination between TE insertions). A cline in 412 copy number in relation to latitude was observed among the natural populations of D. simulans, with very high numbers existing in some local populations (around 60 copies in a sample from Canberra, Australia). An apparent absence of selection effects in this Canberra sample and a value of transposition rate equal to 1-2 x 10(-3) whatever the population and its copy number agree with the idea of recent but temporarily drastic TE movements in local populations.

Lesions induced by gamma-rays are repaired slowly in mu2a oocytes, but become ""fixed"" as terminal deficiencies upon fertilization. A few lesions induced in wild-type females also produce terminal deficiencies. Mutator males do not exhibit an increase in terminal deletions, regardless of the germ cell stage irradiated. In addition, there is no increase in the mutant frequency when mature sperm are irradiated and fertilize eggs produced by mu2a females.

Drosophila embryonic pattern repair: how embryos respond to bicoid dosage alteration,9118810,,"The product of the maternal effect gene, bicoid (bcd), is a transcription factor that acts in a concentration-dependent fashion to direct the establishment of anterior fates in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Embryos laid by mothers with fewer or greater than the normal two copies of bcd show initial alterations in the expression of the gap, segmentation and segment polarity genes, as well as changes in early morphological markers. In the absence of a fate map repair system, one would predict that these initial changes would result in drastic changes in the shape and size of larval and adult structures. However, these embryos develop into relatively normal larvae and adults. This indicates that there is plasticity in Drosophila embryonic development along the anterior-posterior axis. Embryos laid by mothers with six copies of bcd have reduced viability, indicating a threshold for repairing anterior-posterior mispatterning. We show that cell death plays a major role in correcting expanded regions of the fate map. There is a concomitant decrease of cell death in compressed regions of the fate map. We also show that compression of the fate map does not appear to be repaired by the induction of new cell divisions. In addition, some tissues are more sensitive to fate map compression than others.",1997,"R Namba, T M Pazdera, R L Cerrone, J S Minden, R Namba, T M Pazdera, R L Cerrone, J S Minden"
Molecular characterization of a novel human PDZ domain protein with homology to INAD from Drosophila melanogaster,9280290,10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00877-6,"PDZ domains are thought to act as protein-binding modules mediating the clustering of membrane and membrane-associated proteins.

The predicted 516-residue human protein shows strong homology (51% amino acid sequence identity) to the D. melanogaster protein, indicating that this new human gene may encode proline oxidase. Northern analysis shows that the gene is expressed in human lung, skeletal muscle and brain, to a lesser extent in heart and kidney, and weakly in liver, placenta and pancreas. The gene was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization and by in situ hybridization with a [3H]-labelled DNA probe to chromosome 22q11.2, a region previously implicated in type-I hyperprolinaemia in a case of CATCH 22 syndrome, a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving 22q11. Taken together, the evidence indicates that this new human gene is a good candidate gene for type-I hyperprolinaemia. In view of the neurological phenotype of the D. melanogaster sluggish-A mutant, it is of interest that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder susceptibility genes also map in this region.",1997,"H D Campbell, G C Webb, I G Young, H D Campbell, G C Webb, I G Young"

Twist-mediated activation of the NK-4 homeobox gene in the visceral mesoderm of Drosophila requires two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory elements,9211899,10.1074/jbc.272.28.17531,"NK-4, also called msh2 and tinman, encodes a homeodomain transcription factor that is required for the development of the dorsal mesoderm and its derivatives in the Drosophila embryo. Genetic analyses indicate that NK-4 resides downstream of the mesodermal determinant twist, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factor. However, the regulation of NK-4 by twist remains poorly understood. Using expression assays in cultured cells and transgenic flies, we show that two distinct clusters of E-box regulatory sequences, present upstream of the NK-4 gene, mediate NK-4 expression in the visceral mesoderm. These elements are conserved between the Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis NK-4 genes and serve as binding sites for Twist (E1 cluster) and NK-4 (E2 cluster) proteins. In cultured cells, Twist and NK-4 binding results in activation of NK-4 gene expression. In transgenic animals, the E1 and E2 clusters are functionally connected, and both elements are required for NK-4 activation in cells of the visceral mesoderm and also for NK-4 repression in cells of the somatic musculature. These results demonstrate that NK-4 is a direct transcriptional target for Twist and its own gene product in visceral mesodermal cells, supporting the idea that twist and NK-4 function in the subdivision of the mesoderm during Drosophila embryogenesis.",1997,"Y M Lee, T Park, R A Schulz, Y Kim, Y M Lee, T Park, R A Schulz, Y Kim"

The Drosophila gene was localized by chromosome in-situ hybridization to region 83AB of the third chromosome. The methyltransferase coding sequence is distributed among four exons within a 1.4-kb segment of the genome; it predicts a polypeptide of 226 amino acids that is 55% identical to the mouse enzyme. When expressed in bacteria, the Drosophila protein exhibits PCMT activity. A single 1.4-kb Pcmt transcript is detected in RNA preparations from embryos, larvae, pupae and adults. The abundance of the transcript, which is lowest in larvae and highest in adults, parallels the specific activity of the enzyme measured in extracts from the same developmental stages. It has been proposed that the PCMT initiates the repair of structurally damaged cellular proteins. The constitutive expression of PCMT and the relatively high level of expression in postmitotic adult cells suggest that PCMT activity is required through development, but acquires additional significance in aging tissues.",1997,"M B O'Connor, A Galus, M Hartenstine, M Magee, F R Jackson, C M O'Connor, M B O'Connor, A Galus, M Hartenstine, M Magee, F R Jackson, C M O'Connor"

The giant chromosomes are defective in somatic pairing, indicating that a functional component of the chromosomes is influenced. Genes at different sites are affected, but the similarity of the phenotypes and complex complementation pattern reveals that their functions are interrelated. In the brain of malignant brain tumor recombinants and mutants in proliferative genes, polytene cells appear; wildtype does not amplify DNA in brain tissue cells.

A screen for fast evolving genes from Drosophila,9275195,10.1073/pnas.94.18.9746,"In an attempt to quantify the rates of protein sequence divergence in Drosophila, we have devised a screen to differentiate between slow and fast evolving genes. We find that over one-third of randomly drawn cDNAs from a Drosophila melanogaster library do not cross-hybridize with Drosophila virilis DNA, indicating that they evolve with a very high rate. To determine the evolutionary characteristics of such protein sequences, we sequenced their homologs from a more closely related species (Drosophila yakuba). The amino acid substitution rates among these cDNAs are among the fastest known and several are only about 2-fold lower than the corresponding values for silent substitutions. An analysis of within-species polymorphisms for one of these sequences reveals an exceptionally high number of polymorphic amino acid positions, indicating that the protein is not under strong negative selection.

Identification of trans-acting genes necessary for centromere function in Drosophila melanogaster using centromere-defective minichromosomes,9055083,,"Deletions in the Drosophila minichromosome Dp1187 were used to investigate the genetic interactions of trans-acting genes with the centromere. Mutations in several genes known to have a role in chromosome inheritance were shown to have dominant effects on the stability of minichromosomes with partially defective centromeres. Heterozygous mutations in the ncd and klp3A kinesin-like protein genes strongly reduced the transmission of minichromosomes missing portions of the genetically defined centromere but had little effect on the transmission of minichromosomes with intact centromeres. Using this approach, ncd and klp3A were shown to require only the centromeric region of the chromosome for their roles in chromosome segregation. Increased gene dosage also affected minichromosome transmission and was used to demonstrate that the nod kinesin-like protein gene interacts genetically with the centro mere, in addition to interacting with extracentromeric regions as demonstrated previously. The results presented in this study strongly suggest that dominant genetic interactions between mutations and centromere-defective minichromosomes could be used effectively to identify novel genes necessary for centromere function.",1997,"K R Cook, T D Murphy, T C Nguyen, G H Karpen, K R Cook, T D Murphy, T C Nguyen, G H Karpen"

It was concluded that there is a possibility to incorporate nerve cells of insects into the brain of vertebrates. Morphological and functional contacts can be established between the transplanted cells and host brain tissues. Transplanted Drosophila cells preserve their viability for a long time, so that a prolonged influence of the transplant upon the recipient can be predicted, which may be used in medical practice.

Developmental constraints and wing shape variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,9418265,10.1038/hdy.1997.201,"The body sizes and shapes of poikilothermic animals generally show clinal variation with latitude. Among the environmental factors responsible for the cline, temperature seems to be the most probable candidate. In the present work we analysed natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected at different geographical localities to determine whether the same selective forces acting on wing development in the laboratory are also at work in the wild. We show that the temperature selection acting on wing development in the laboratory is only one of the selective forces operating in the wild. The size differences between natural populations seem to depend exclusively on cell number whereas they depend on cell area in the laboratory. The two wing compartments behave as distinct units of selection subjected to different genetic control, confirming our previous observations on laboratory populations. In addition, subunits of development defined as regions of cell proliferation centres restricted within longitudinal veins can, in turn, be considered as subunits of selection. Their interaction during development and continuous natural selection around an optimum could explain the high wing shape stability generally found in natural populations.",1997,"M C Pezzoli, D Guerra, G Giorgi, F Garoia, S Cavicchi, M C Pezzoli, D Guerra, G Giorgi, F Garoia, S Cavicchi"
Comparison of chromosomal DNA composing timeless in Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis suggests a new conserved structure for the TIMELESS protein,9365248,10.1093/nar/25.23.4710,"Two proteins, TIM and PER, physically interact to control circadian cycles of tim and per transcription in Drosophila melanogaster. In the present study the structure of TIM protein expressed by D. virilis was determined by isolation and sequence analysis of genomic DNA (gDNA) corresponding to the D. virilis tim locus (v tim ). Comparison of v tim and m tim gDNA revealed high conservation of the TIM protein. This contrasts with poor sequence conservation previously observed for the TIM partner protein PER in these species. Inspection of the v tim sequence suggests an alternative structure for most TIM proteins. Sequences forming an intron in a previously characterized D. melanogaster tim cDNA appear to be most often translated to produce a longer TIM protein in both species. The N-terminal sequence of vTIM and sequence analysis of genomic DNA from several strains of D. melanogaster suggest that only one of two possible translation initiation sites found in tim mRNA is sufficient to generate circadian rhythms in D. melanogaster. TIM translation may be affected by multiple AUG codons that appear to have been conserved in sequences composing the 5'-untranslated tim mRNA leader.",1997,"M P Myers, A Rothenfluh, M Chang, M W Young"
Physiological mechanisms of evolved desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,9225453,,"We investigated physiological characters associated with water balance in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to desiccating conditions for over 100 generations. Five replicate, outbred, desiccation-selected (D) populations were compared with their control (C) populations. Water loss rates of female D flies were approximately 40% lower than those of C females. Although excretory water loss was reduced in desiccation-selected flies, it comprised less than 10% of total water loss, indicating that the D populations have evolved reduced cuticular and/or respiratory water loss rates. Total surface lipid amounts did not differ between the C and D flies. Cuticular hydrocarbons from D flies were longer than those from C flies and melted at slightly higher temperatures, possibly contributing to reduced water loss rates. Desiccation-selected flies contained approximately 30% more bulk water than controls, as well as more glycogen. However, total metabolic water stores did not differ between the stocks owing to higher lipid levels in the C populations. The ability to tolerate water loss, as measured by water content at the time of death, did not differ between D and C flies. Thus, evolution of increased desiccation resistance has occurred by multiple physiological mechanisms, but some potential adaptive differences have not evolved.",1997,"A G Gibbs, A K Chippindale, M R Rose, A G Gibbs, A K Chippindale, M R Rose"
"Selection and methionine accumulation in the fat body protein 2 gene (FBP2), a duplicate of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene",9010133,10.1007/pl00006118,"The Drosophila fat body protein 2 gene (Fbp2) is an ancient duplication of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene (Adh) which encodes a protein that differs substantially from ADH in its methionine content. In D. melanogaster, there is one methionine in ADH, while there are 51 (20% of all amino acids) in FBP2. Methionine is involved in 46% of amino acid replacements when Fbp2 DNA sequences are compared between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Methionine accumulation does not affect conserved residues of the ADH-ADHr-FBP2 multigene family. The multigene family has evolved by replacement of mildly hydrophobic amino acids by methionine with no apparent reversion. Its short-term evolution was compared between two Drosophila species, while its long-term evolution was compared between two genera belonging respectively to acalyptrate and calyptrate Diptera, Drosophila and Sarcophaga. The pattern of nucleotide substitution was consistent with an independent accumulation of methionines at the Fbp2 locus in each lineage. Under a steady-state model, the rate of methionine accumulation was constant in the lineage leading to Drosophila, and was twice as fast as that in the calyptrate lineage. Substitution rates were consistent with a slight positive selective advantage for each methionine change in about one-half of amino acid sites in Drosophila. This shows that selection can potentially account for a large proportion of amino acid replacements in the molecular evolution of proteins.",1997,"G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille, G K Meghlaoui, M Veuille"

At all developmental stages CA neurons were distributed widely throughout the CNS but represented only a small fraction of all CNS neurons. Catecholamine-containing processes were confined to the CNS. The CA neurons are first discerned at about 18 hours of embryonic development. We suggest that these larval CA neurons are maintained throughout the ontogeny of the fly and that the adult CA pattern is composed of embryonic neurons and neurons that differentiate during metamorphosis.,1988,"V Budnik, K White, V Budnik, K White"

Association of the Drosophila melanogaster engrailed protein with specific soluble nuclear protein complexes,2907478,,"The Drosophila engrailed protein which contains a homeobox domain and specific DNA binding activity is believed to function in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis.

The engrailed complexes have molecular masses between 10(7) and 10(8) which suggests they contain a polymeric protein component. The complex is able to bind reversibly to DNA and a definitive purification shows it to be constituted of 12 distinct protein species, two of which are predominant. Purified, bacterially produced engrailed protein can be reconstituted with both culture cell and embryo nuclear protein fractions to form complexes of the same and related composition respectively.

Multiple repeated units in Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal DNA spacer stimulate rRNA precursor transcription,2840664,10.1073/pnas.85.15.5502,"Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcriptional units are separated by nontranscribed spacer (NTS) segments consisting of tandemly arranged repeats 95, 330, and 240 base pairs long. NTS sequences stimulate transcription from the rRNA precursor (pre-rRNA) promoter. Primer extension analysis of RNA from cells cotransfected with plasmids carrying NTS sequences of various lengths shows that the activity of the pre-rRNA promoter is directly correlated with the number of 240-base-pair repeats; NTS sequences upstream of these units also stimulate pre-rRNA transcription. The NTS effect might depend upon transcription from duplicated promoters present within the 240- and 330-base-pair repeats. The strength of the pre-RNA promoter correlates in each construct with the level of spacer transcription. The action of spacer sequences, although able to take place over a large distance, is not independent of orientation: stimulation of pre-rRNA transcription is abolished in plasmids carrying inverted NTS segments. Removal of a putative transcription termination site located upstream of the pre-rRNA promoter has no effect on pre-rRNA initiation nor does it substantially alter spacer enhancement.",1988,"G Grimaldi, P P Di Nocera, G Grimaldi, P P Di Nocera"
Induction of alcohol dehydrogenase by ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster,3127555,10.1093/jn/118.3.398,"When Drosophila melanogaster larvae were fed a defined fat-free, low sucrose medium, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was increased to a higher activity with a moderate, nontoxic level of ethanol (2.5% vol/vol) within 5 h. Ethanol-stimulated increases in ADH activity and cross-reacting material in late third-instar larvae were paralleled by increases in the larval ADH mRNA as indicated by dot blot analysis. Northern blot observations indicated that both adult and larval ADH messages were increased by dietary ethanol. The increased levels of the ADH mRNA transcribed from the proximal and distal promoters of ethanol-fed larvae argue that the induction is a consequence of elevated levels of mRNA, not a result of changes in enzyme stability or synthesis. To determine whether the induction is of nutritional significance to larvae, the rate of flux from ethanol to lipid was estimated in control larvae and larvae that were pre-fed ethanol. Flux changes occurred; the rate of incorporation of [14C]ethanol into body lipid showed a strong association with larval ADH activity. Because the induced increase in larval ADH activity did not extend into the adult stage and attempts to stimulate ADH activity by exposing adults to ethanol were unsuccessful, the modulation of ADH activity by dietary ethanol may be a mechanism by which larvae utilize environmental ethanol as a resource, especially when free sugar levels are low. In addition, ADH in larvae is postulated to perform a second, nonethanol function that expedites the conversion of sugars to lipid when habitats are low in fats, low in ethanol and high in sugars.",1988,"B W Geer, S W McKechnie, M M Bentley, J G Oakeshott, E M Quinn, M L Langevin, B W Geer, S W McKechnie, M M Bentley, J G Oakeshott, E M Quinn, M L Langevin"
Sequence signature analysis of chromosome identity in three Drosophila species,15975141,10.1186/1471-2105-6-158,"Background:
      
    

    
      All eukaryotic organisms need to distinguish each of their chromosomes. A few protein complexes have been described that recognise entire, specific chromosomes, for instance dosage compensation complexes and the recently discovered autosome-specific Painting of Fourth (POF) protein in Drosophila. However, no sequences have been found that are chromosome-specific and distributed over the entire length of the respective chromosome. Here, we present a new, unbiased, exhaustive computational method that was used to probe three Drosophila genomes for chromosome-specific sequences.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      By combining genome annotations and cytological data with multivariate statistics related to three Drosophila genomes we found sequence signatures that distinguish Muller's F-elements (chromosome 4 in D. melanogaster) from all other chromosomes in Drosophila that are not attributable to differences in nucleotide composition, simple sequence repeats or repeated elements. Based on these signatures we identified complex motifs that are strongly overrepresented in the F-elements and found indications that the D. melanogaster motif may be involved in POF-binding to the F-element. In addition, the X-chromosomes of D. melanogaster and D. yakuba can be distinguished from the other chromosomes, albeit to a lesser extent. Surprisingly, the conservation of the F-element sequence signatures extends not only between species separated by approximately 55 Myr, but also linearly along the sequenced part of the F-elements.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Identification and characterization of a Drosophila proteasome regulatory network,15899868,10.1128/MCB.25.11.4662-4675.2005,"Maintaining adequate proteasomal proteolytic activity is essential for eukaryotic cells. For metazoan cells, little is known about the composition of genes that are regulated in the proteasome network or the mechanisms that modulate the levels of proteasome genes. Previously, two distinct treatments have been observed to induce 26S proteasome levels in Drosophila melanogaster cell lines, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of the 26S proteasome subunit Rpn10/S5a and suppression of proteasome activity through treatment with active-site inhibitors. We have carried out genome array profiles from cells with decreased Rpn10/S5a levels using RNAi or from cells treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and have thereby identified candidate genes that are regulated as part of a metazoan proteasome network. The profiles reveal that the majority of genes that were identified to be under the control of the regulatory network consisted of 26S proteasome subunits. The 26S proteasome genes, including three new subunits, Ubp6p, Uch-L3, and Sem1p, were found to be up-regulated. A number of genes known to have proteasome-related functions, including Rad23, isopeptidase T, sequestosome, and the genes for the segregase complex TER94/VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 were also found to be up-regulated. RNAi-mediated inhibition against the segregase complex genes demonstrated pronounced stabilization of proteasome substrates throughout the Drosophila cell. Finally, transcriptional reporter assays and deletion mapping studies in Drosophila demonstrate that proteasome mRNA induction is dependent upon the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Transfer of the 5' UTR from the proteasome subunit Rpn1/S2 to a noninducible promoter was sufficient to confer transcriptional upregulation of the reporter mRNA after proteasome inhibition.",2005,"Josefin Lundgren, Patrick Masson, Zahra Mirzaei, Patrick Young, Josefin Lundgren, Patrick Masson, Zahra Mirzaei, Patrick Young"
A measure of the within-chromosome synergistic epistasis for Drosophila viability,16033587,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00892.x,"In order to detect possible synergistic epistasis for viability in Drosophila melanogaster we assayed the relative viability of chromosomes II in: (i) panmixia, (ii) forced total homozygosity, and (iii) homozygosity for, on the average, half of their loci. As these genotypes were constructed using exactly the same set of chromosomes in the three cases, the design allows us to estimate the inbreeding depression rate at two different inbreeding levels in the absence of purging natural selection. Overall, no consistent synergistic epistasis was found. However, there was a small fraction of chromosomes whose severely deleterious effect when homozygous was almost significantly larger than expected from their viability when homozygous for half of their loci. This suggests occasional but important synergistic epistasis, which might confer evolutionary advantage to recombination in tightly linked genomes. Nevertheless, such epistasis is unlikely to be an evolutionary advantage driving the evolution of sexual anisogamous reproduction, as its contribution to overall viability is small when compared with the two-fold cost of anisogamy.",2005,"J M Rosa, S Camacho, A GarcÃ­a-Dorado, J M Rosa, S Camacho, A GarcÃ­a-Dorado"
Neurodegenerative mutants in Drosophila: a means to identify genes and mechanisms involved in human diseases?,16187075,10.1007/s10158-005-0005-8,"There are 50 ways to leave your lover (Simon 1987) but many more to kill your brain cells. Several neurodegenerative diseases in humans, like Alzheimer's disease, have been intensely studied but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown for most of them. For those syndromes where associated gene products have been identified their biochemistry and physiological as well as pathogenic function is often still under debate. This is in part due to the inherent limitations of genetic analyses in humans and other mammals and therefore experimentally accessible invertebrate in vivo models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have recently been introduced to investigate neurodegenerative syndromes. Several laboratories have used transgenic approaches in Drosophila to study the human genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This has added substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The isolation and characterization of Drosophila mutants, which display a variety of neurodegenerative phenotypes, also provide valuable insights into genes, pathways, and mechanisms causing neurodegeneration. So far only about two dozen such mutants have been described but already their characterization reveals an involvement of various cellular functions in neurodegeneration, ranging from preventing oxidative stress to RNA editing. Some of the isolated genes can already be associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and hopefully the isolation and characterization of more of these mutants, together with an analysis of homologous genes in vertebrate models, will provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of human neurodegenerative diseases.",2005,"Doris Kretzschmar, Doris Kretzschmar"

We analyzed the protein content of these tissues and found that it strongly differed between virulent and avirulent parasitoid strains. Four protein bands present in virulent long glands were eluted and their immune suppressive effect was assessed in vivo, allowing demonstrating a major effect of one of these proteins. The corresponding cDNA encodes a predicted 30 kDa subunit containing a Ras homologous GTPase Activating Protein (RhoGAP) domain, suggesting a possible involvement in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton changes. Using Western-blot experiments, we showed that this protein is abundant in virulent female long glands but is undetectable in virulent females deprived of long glands or in long glands from avirulent wasps.

"Rates of divergence in gene expression profiles of primates, mice, and flies: stabilizing selection and variability among functional categories",15792233,,"The extent to which natural selection shapes phenotypic variation has long been a matter of debate among those studying organic evolution. We studied the patterns of gene expression polymorphism and divergence in several datasets that ranged from comparisons between two very closely related laboratory strains of mice to comparisons across a considerably longer time scale, such as between humans and chimpanzees, two species of mice, and two species of Drosophila. The results were analyzed and interpreted in view of neutral models of phenotypic evolution. Our analyses used a number of metrics to show that most mRNA levels are evolutionary stable, changing little across the range of taxonomic distances compared. This implies that, overall, widespread stabilizing selection on transcription levels has prevented greater evolutionary changes in mRNA levels. Nevertheless, the range of rates of divergence is large with highly significant differences in the rate and patterns of transcription divergence across functional classes defined on the basis of the gene ontology annotation (primates and mice datasets) or on the basis of the pattern of sex-biased gene expression (Drosophila). Moreover, rates of divergence of sex-biased genes in the contrast between Drosophila species show a distinct pattern from that observed in the contrast between populations of D. melanogaster. Hence, we discuss the time scale of the changes observed and its consequences for the relationship between variation in gene expression within and between species. Finally, we argue that differences in mRNA levels of the magnitudes observed herein could be explained by a remarkably small number of generations of directional selection.",2005,"Bernardo Lemos, Colin D Meiklejohn, Mario CÃ¡ceres, Daniel L Hartl, Bernardo Lemos, Colin D Meiklejohn, Mario CÃ¡ceres, Daniel L Hartl"

Elevated polymorphism and divergence in the class C scavenger receptors of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans,15716507,10.1534/genetics.104.034249,"Scavenger receptor proteins are involved in the cellular internalization of a broad variety of foreign material, including pathogenic bacteria during phagocytosis. I find here that nonsynonymous divergence in three class C scavenger receptors (Sr-C's) between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans and between each of these species and D. yakuba is approximately four times the typical genome average. These genes also exhibit unusually high levels of segregating nonsynonymous polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans populations. A fourth Sr-C is comparatively conserved. McDonald-Kreitman tests reveal a significant excess of replacement fixations between D. melanogaster and D. simulans in the Sr-C's, but tests of polymorphic site frequency spectra do not support models of directional selection. It is possible that the molecular functions of SR-C proteins are sufficiently robust to allow exceptionally high amino acid substitution rates without compromising organismal fitness. Alternatively, SR-Cs may evolve under diversifying selection, perhaps as a result of pressure from pathogens. Interestingly, Sr-CIII and Sr-CIV are polymorphic for premature stop codons. Sr-CIV is also polymorphic for an in-frame 101-codon deletion and for the absence of one intron.",2005,"Brian P Lazzaro, Brian P Lazzaro"

PIP2 hydrolysis and calcium release are required for cytokinesis in Drosophila spermatocytes,16085493,10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.060,"The role of calcium (Ca(2+)) in cytokinesis is controversial, and the precise pathways that lead to its release during cleavage are not well understood. Ca(2+) is released from intracellular stores by binding of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) to the IP3 receptor (IP3R), yet no clear role in cytokinesis has been established for the precursor of IP3, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Here, using transgenic flies expressing PLCdelta-PH-GFP, which specifically binds PIP2, we identify PIP2 in the plasma membrane and cleavage furrows of dividing Drosophila melanogaster spermatocytes, and we establish that this phospholipid is required for continued ingression but not for initiation of cytokinesis. In addition, by inhibiting phospholipase C, we show that PIP2 must be hydrolyzed to maintain cleavage furrow stability. Using an IP3R antagonist and a Ca(2+) chelator to examine the roles of IP3R and Ca(2+) in cytokinesis, we demonstrate that both of these factors are required for cleavage furrow stability, although Ca(2+) is dispensable for cleavage plane specification and initiation of furrowing. Strikingly, providing cells with Ca(2+) obviates the need to hydrolyze PIP2. Thus, PIP2, PIP2 hydrolysis, and Ca(2+) are required for the normal progression of cytokinesis in these cells.",2005,"Raymond Wong, Irene Hadjiyanni, Ho-Chun Wei, Gordon Polevoy, Rachel McBride, Kai-Ping Sem, Julie A Brill, Raymond Wong, Irene Hadjiyanni, Ho-Chun Wei, Gordon Polevoy, Rachel McBride, Kai-Ping Sem, Julie A Brill"

The confidence interval around the estimated position of selection is reasonably narrow.

cis-regulatory logic of short-range transcriptional repression in Drosophila melanogaster,15831448,10.1128/MCB.25.9.3411-3420.2005,"Bioinformatics analysis of transcriptional control is guided by knowledge of the characteristics of cis-regulatory regions or enhancers. Features such as clustering of binding sites and co-occurrence of binding sites have aided enhancer identification, but quantitative predictions of enhancer function are not yet generally feasible. To facilitate the analysis of regulatory sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified quantitative parameters that affect the activity of short-range transcriptional repressors, proteins that play key roles in development. In addition to the previously noted distance dependence, repression is strongly influenced by the stoichiometry, affinity, spacing, and arrangement of activator binding sites. Repression is insensitive to the type of activation domain, suggesting that short-range repression may primarily affect activators at the level of DNA binding. The activity of several short-range, but not long-range, repressors is circumscribed by the same quantitative parameters. This cis-regulatory ""grammar"" may aid the identification of enhancers regulated by short-range repressors and facilitate bioinformatic prediction of the functional output of transcriptional regulatory sequences.",2005,"Meghana M Kulkarni, David N Arnosti, Meghana M Kulkarni, David N Arnosti"
Genetic variation for dorsal-ventral patterning of the Drosophila melanogaster eggshell,15733305,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05009.x,"Patterning of the insect eggshell is an excellent system for exploring the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In Drosophila melanogaster, two dorsal-anterior respiratory appendages are produced in response to signaling through the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr). Previous work implicates Egfr pathway function in both intraspecific variation for dorsal appendage spacing (DAS) on the eggshell, as well as interspecific differences in dorsal appendage number and location. To test the hypothesis that genetic variation in Egfr contributes to variation in eggshell patterning, we have made use of naturally occurring intraspecific variation for DAS as a model quantitative trait. We found that there is substantial segregating genetic variation for DAS in D. melanogaster, and have tested for associations with 289 common polymorphisms in the Egfr locus. A marginal association was seen with two polymorphic sites in Egfr; however, we failed to replicate these findings in a second population, or in a modified quantitative complementation test designed to specifically test the effects of the putative polymorphisms. Therefore, we conclude that the polymorphisms we have identified in Egfr do not contribute to variation in DAS, and further work is required to understand the genetic architecture of this trait.",2005,"Lisa M Goering, Greg Gibson, Lisa M Goering, Greg Gibson"

Drosophila melanogaster NEP2 is a new soluble member of the neprilysin family of endopeptidases with implications for reproduction and renal function,15554877,10.1042/BJ20041753,"The mammalian neprilysin (NEP) family members are typically type II membrane endopeptidases responsible for the activation/inactivation of neuropeptides and peptide hormones. Differences in substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the seven mammalian NEPs contribute to their functional diversity. The sequencing of the Drosophila melanogaster genome has revealed a large expansion of this gene family, resulting in over 20 fly NEP-like genes, suggesting even greater diversity in structure and function than seen in mammals. We now report that one of these genes (Nep2) codes for a secreted endopeptidase with a highly restricted pattern of expression. D. melanogaster NEP2 is expressed in the specialized stellate cells of the renal tubules and in the cyst cells that surround the elongating spermatid bundles in adult testis, suggesting roles for the peptidase in renal function and in spermatogenesis. D. melanogaster NEP2 was found in vesicle-like structures in the syncytial cytoplasm of the spermatid bundles, suggesting that the protein was acquired by endocytosis of protein secreted from the cyst cells. Expression of NEP2 cDNA in D. melanogaster S2 cells confirmed that the peptidase is secreted and is only weakly inhibited by thiorphan, a potent inhibitor of human NEP. D. melanogaster NEP2 also differs from human NEP in the manner in which the peptidase cleaves the tachykinin, GPSGFYGVR-amide. Molecular modelling suggests that there are important structural differences between D. melanogaster NEP2 and human NEP in the S1' and S2' ligand-binding subsites, which might explain the observed differences in inhibitor and substrate specificities. A soluble isoform of a mouse NEP-like peptidase is strongly expressed in spermatids, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for a soluble endopeptidase in spermatogenesis.",2005,"Josie E Thomas, Caroline M Rylett, Ahmet Carhan, Nicholas D Bland, Richard J Bingham, Alan D Shirras, Anthony J Turner, R Elwyn Isaac"

At 98 +/- 2 h, the anterior midgut from control and treated larvae were dissected out, single-cell suspensions were prepared and Comet assay was performed. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in DNA damage with all the four alkylating agents, in comparison to control. The lower concentration (0.05 mM) of the test chemicals, except MMS, did not induce any DNA damage in the gut cells of the exposed larvae. When comparison of Comet parameters was made among the chemicals, MMS was found to be the most potent genotoxicant and ENU the least.

Expression of defective proventriculus during head capsule development is conserved in Drosophila and stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae),15834584,10.1007/s00427-005-0488-7,"Hypercephaly, in the form of lateral extensions of the head capsule, is observed in several families of Diptera. A particularly exaggerated form is found in Diopsid stalk-eyed flies, in which both eyes and antennae are laterally displaced at the end of stalks. The processes of early development and specification of the head capsule in stalk-eyed flies are similar to those in Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila the homeobox gene ocelliless (oc) shows a mediolateral gradient of expression across the region of the eye-antennal imaginal disc that gives rise to the head capsule and specifies the development of different head structures. The genes and developmental mechanisms that subsequently define head shape in Drosophila and produce hypercephaly in stalk-eyed flies remain unclear. To address this, we performed an enhancer trap screen for Drosophila genes expressed in the same region as oc and identified the homeobox gene defective proventriculus (dve). In the eye-antennal imaginal disc, dve is coexpressed with oc in the region that gives rise to the head capsule and is active along the medial edge of the antennal disc and in the first antennal segment. Analyses of dve expression in mutant eye-antennal discs are consistent with it acting downstream of oc in the development of the head capsule. We confirm that orthologues of dve are present in a diverse panel of five stalk-eyed fly species and analyse patterns of dve sequence variation within the clade.

However, the expression of essential heterochromatic genes within these apparently repressive regions of the genome presents a paradox, an understanding of which could provide key insights into the effects of chromatin structure on gene expression. To date, very few of these resident heterochromatic genes have been characterized to any extent, and their expression and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two proximal heterochromatic genes in D. melanogaster, located deep within the centric heterochromatin of the left arm of chromosome 3. One of these genes, RpL15, is uncharacteristically small, is highly expressed, and encodes an essential ribosomal protein. Its expression appears to be compromised in a genetic background deficient for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a protein associated with gene silencing in these regions. The second gene in this study, Dbp80, is very large and also appears to show a transcriptional dependence upon HP1; however, it does not correspond to any known lethal complementation group and is likely to be a nonessential gene.",2005,"Sandra R Schulze, Donald A R Sinclair, Kathleen A Fitzpatrick, Barry M Honda, Sandra R Schulze, Donald A R Sinclair, Kathleen A Fitzpatrick, Barry M Honda"

Tum/RacGAP50C provides a critical link between anaphase microtubules and the assembly of the contractile ring in Drosophila melanogaster,16280552,10.1242/jcs.02652,"A central question in understanding cytokinesis is how the cleavage plane is positioned. Although the positioning signal is likely to be transmitted via the anaphase microtubule array to the cell cortex, exactly how the microtubule array determines the site of contractile ring formation remains unresolved. By analysing tum/RacGAP50C mutant Drosophila embryos we show that cells lacking Tum do not form furrows and fail to localise the key cytokinetic components Pebble (a RhoGEF), Aurora B kinase, Diaphanous, Pav-KLP and Anillin. The GAP activity of Tum is required for cytokinesis: in its absence cytokinesis fails early even though Tum is present on microtubules at the cell equator where the furrow should form.

The conserved histidine 106 of large thioredoxin reductases is likely to have a structural role but not a base catalyst function,15670839,10.1016/j.febslet.2005.01.001,"The catalytic activity of selenocysteine-containing thioredoxin reductases can be mimicked by cysteine-variants if the local environment at the C-terminal redox center supports thiol activation. This concept of a linear catalytic site was challenged by structural data suggesting that the invariant residue His106 functions as a base catalyst for the dithiol-disulphide exchange reaction between enzyme and substrate. As reported here, we changed His106 to asparagine, glutamine, and phenylalanine in various C-terminal mutants of Drosophila melanogaster thioredoxin reductase. The catalytic activity dropped considerably, yet pH-profiles did not reveal differences, rendering a function for His106 as a base catalyst unlikely. Interestingly, the phenylalanine-mutants, designed as negative controls were the most active mutants which suggests rather a structural role of His106.",2005,"Judit Jacob, R Heiner Schirmer, Stephan Gromer, Judit Jacob, R Heiner Schirmer, Stephan Gromer"
Evolution of the chromosomal location of rDNA genes in two Drosophila species subgroups: ananassae and melanogaster,15726113,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800612,"The evolution of the chromosomal location of ribosomal RNA gene clusters and the organization of heterochromatin in the Drosophila melanogaster group were investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and DAPI staining to mitotic chromosomes. The investigation of 18 species (11 of which were being examined for the first time) belonging to the melanogaster and ananassae subgroups suggests that the ancestral configuration consists of one nucleolus organizer (NOR) on each sex chromosome. This pattern, which is conserved throughout the melanogaster subgroup, except in D. simulans and D. sechellia, was observed only in the ercepeae complex within the ananassae subgroup. Both sex-linked NORs must have been lost in the lineage leading to D. varians and in the ananassae and bipectinata complexes, whereas new sites, characterized by intra-species variation in hybridization signal size, appeared on the fourth chromosome related to heterochromatic rearrangements. Nucleolar material is thought to be required for sex chromosome pairing and disjunction in a variety of organisms including Drosophila. Thus, either remnant sequences, possibly intergenic spacer repeats, are still present in the sex chromosomes which have lost their NORs (as observed in D. simulans and D. sechellia), or an alternative mechanism has evolved.",2005,"V Roy, L Monti-Dedieu, N Chaminade, S Siljak-Yakovlev, S Aulard, F Lemeunier, C Montchamp-Moreau, V Roy, L Monti-Dedieu, N Chaminade, S Siljak-Yakovlev, S Aulard, F Lemeunier, C Montchamp-Moreau"

The functions of these isoforms have never been addressed in vivo. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to examine their functions in a fully integrated system. First, we established that the human c-Myc protein can rescue lethal mutations of the Drosophila myc ortholog, dmyc, demonstrating the biological relevance of this model. Then, we characterized a new lethal dmyc insertion allele, which permits expression of human c-Myc in place of dMyc and used it to compare physiological activities of these isoforms in whole-organism rescue, transcription, cell growth, and apoptosis. These isoforms differ both quantitatively and qualitatively. Most remarkably, while the small c-MycS form truncated for much of its N-terminal trans-activation domain efficiently rescued viability and cell growth, it did not induce detectable programmed cell death. Our data indicate that the main functional difference between c-Myc isoforms resides in their apoptotic properties and that the N-terminal region, containing the conserved MbI motif, is decisive in governing the choice between growth and death.",2005,"C Benassayag, L Montero, N ColombiÃ©, P Gallant, D Cribbs, D Morello, C Benassayag, L Montero, N ColombiÃ©, P Gallant, D Cribbs, D Morello"
Pairing between gypsy insulators facilitates the enhancer action in trans throughout the Drosophila genome,16227580,10.1128/MCB.25.21.9283-9291.2005,"The Suppressor of the Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] binding region within the gypsy retrotransposon is the best known chromatin insulator in Drosophila melanogaster. According to previous data, two copies of the gypsy insulator inserted between an enhancer and a promoter neutralize each other's actions, which is indicative of an interaction between the protein complexes bound to the insulators. We have investigated the role of pairing between the gypsy insulators located on homologous chromosomes in trans interaction between yellow enhancers and a promoter. It has been shown that trans activation of the yellow promoter strongly depends on the site of the transposon insertion, which is evidence for a role of surrounding chromatin in homologous pairing. The presence of the gypsy insulators in both homologous chromosomes even at a distance of 9 kb downstream from the promoter dramatically improves the trans activation of yellow. Moreover, the gypsy insulators have proved to stabilize trans activation between distantly located enhancers and a promoter.

Hormonal pleiotropy and the juvenile hormone regulation of Drosophila development and life history,16163709,10.1002/bies.20290,"Understanding how traits are integrated at the organismal level remains a fundamental problem at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology. Hormones, regulatory signaling molecules that coordinate multiple developmental and physiological processes, are major determinants underlying phenotypic integration. The probably best example for this is the lipid-like juvenile hormone (JH) in insects. Here we review the manifold effects of JH, the most versatile animal hormone, with an emphasis on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism amenable to both genetics and endocrinology. JH affects a remarkable number of processes and traits in Drosophila development and life history, including metamorphosis, behavior, reproduction, diapause, stress resistance and aging. While many molecular details underlying JH signaling remain unknown, we argue that studying ""hormonal pleiotropy"" offers intriguing insights into phenotypic integration and the mechanisms underlying life history evolution.

Conservation of regulatory sequences and gene expression patterns in the disintegrating Drosophila Hox gene complex,15867430,10.1101/gr.3468605,"Homeotic (Hox) genes are usually clustered and arranged in the same order as they are expressed along the anteroposterior body axis of metazoans. The mechanistic explanation for this colinearity has been elusive, and it may well be that a single and universal cause does not exist. The Hox-gene complex (HOM-C) has been rearranged differently in several Drosophila species, producing a striking diversity of Hox gene organizations. We investigated the genomic and functional consequences of the two HOM-C splits present in Drosophila buzzatii. Firstly, we sequenced two regions of the D. buzzatii genome, one containing the genes labial and abdominal A, and another one including proboscipedia, and compared their organization with that of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura in order to map precisely the two splits. Then, a plethora of conserved noncoding sequences, which are putative enhancers, were identified around the three Hox genes closer to the splits. The position and order of these enhancers are conserved, with minor exceptions, between the three Drosophila species. Finally, we analyzed the expression patterns of the same three genes in embryos and imaginal discs of four Drosophila species with different Hox-gene organizations. The results show that their expression patterns are conserved despite the HOM-C splits. We conclude that, in Drosophila, Hox-gene clustering is not an absolute requirement for proper function. Rather, the organization of Hox genes is modular, and their clustering seems the result of phylogenetic inertia more than functional necessity.",2005,"BÃ¡rbara Negre, SÃ²nia Casillas, Magali Suzanne, Ernesto SÃ¡nchez-Herrero, Michael Akam, Michael Nefedov, Antonio Barbadilla, Pieter de Jong, Alfredo Ruiz, BÃ¡rbara Negre, SÃ²nia Casillas, Magali Suzanne, Ernesto SÃ¡nchez-Herrero, Michael Akam, Michael Nefedov, Antonio Barbadilla, Pieter de Jong, Alfredo Ruiz"

Multilocus patterns of nucleotide variability and the demographic and selection history of Drosophila melanogaster populations,15930491,10.1101/gr.3541005,"Uncertainty about the demographic history of populations can hamper genome-wide scans for selection based on population genetic models. To obtain a portrait of the effects of demographic history on genome variability patterns in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we surveyed noncoding DNA polymorphism at 10 X-linked loci in large samples from three African and two non-African populations. All five populations show significant departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We detect weak but significant differentiation between East (Kenya and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and significant heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the Gabon sample suggest that this population is further from mutation-drift equilibrium than the two Eastern African populations. Both non-African populations harbor significantly higher levels of LD, a large excess of high-frequency-derived mutations and extreme heterogeneity among loci in levels of polymorphism and divergence. Rejections of the neutral model in D. melanogaster populations using these and similar features have been interpreted as evidence for an important role for natural selection in shaping genome variability patterns. Based on simulations, we conclude that simple bottleneck models are sufficient to account for most, if not all, polymorphism features of both African and non-African populations. In contrast, we show that a steady-state recurrent hitchhiking model fails to account for several aspects of the data. Demographic departures from equilibrium expectations in both ancestral and derived populations thus represent a serious challenge to detecting positive selection in genome-wide scans using current methodologies.",2005,"Penelope R Haddrill, Kevin R Thornton, Brian Charlesworth, Peter Andolfatto, Penelope R Haddrill, Kevin R Thornton, Brian Charlesworth, Peter Andolfatto"

We identified QTL responsible for natural variation for wing shape and analyzed their interactions with developmental genetic signaling pathways important for vein positioning. The QTL analysis indicated that the total number of QTL segregating in this population is likely to be very large. The locations of putative QTL identified in this study were compared to those identified in previous studies and, while there is more correspondence across studies than expected by chance on the third chromosome, the studies appear to have identified different QTL. Using a complementation design, we tested for interactions among these QTL with the Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic signaling pathways, which are important for the development and position of vein pairs L3-L4 and L2-L5. Three QTL showed strong interactions with these two pathways, supporting the hypothesis that these QTL are involved in these pathways.

Despite intense characterization of mammalian Vav proteins both biochemically and genetically, there is little information regarding the conservation of their biological properties in lower organisms. To approach this issue, we have performed a characterization of the regulatory, catalytic, and functional properties of the single Vav family member of Drosophila melanogaster. These analyses have shown that the intramolecular mechanisms controlling the enzyme activity of mammalian Vav proteins are already present in Drosophila, suggesting that such properties have been set up before the divergence between protostomes and deuterostomes during evolution. We also show that Drosophila and mammalian Vav proteins have similar catalytic specificities. As a consequence, Drosophila Vav can trigger oncogenic transformation, morphological change, and enhanced cell motility in mammalian cells. Gain-of-function studies using transgenic flies support the implication of this protein in cytoskeletal-dependent processes such as embryonic dorsal closure, myoblast fusion, tracheal development, and the migration/guidance of different cell types. These results highlight the important roles of Vav proteins in the signal transduction pathways regulating cytoskeletal dynamics.

Dpp is divided into three regions: Hin, including the protein-coding exons; disk, including 3' cis-regulatory sequences; and shortvein (shv), including noncoding exons and 5' cis-regulatory sequences. We analyzed the cis-regulatory structure of the shortvein region using a nested series of rearrangement breakpoints and rescue constructs. We delimit the molecular regions responsible for three mutant phenotypes: larval lethality, wing venation defects, and head capsule defects. Multiple overlapping elements are responsible for larval lethality and wing venation defects. However, the area regulating head capsule formation is distinct, and resides 5' to these elements.

The evolutionary history of Drosophila buzzatii. XXXIV.

In Iberian populations, Osvaldo insertion sites do not follow a Poisson distribution, most probably due to eight euchromatic sites with high occupancy, found in all populations. The estimated alpha and beta parameters, which measure the relative importance of drift and negative selection in shaping frequency distributions, indicate that drift is the main force acting upon the distribution of Osvaldo in natural populations of D. buzzatii in the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, Osvaldo distribution in populations from Argentina is similar to the distribution of elements with low copy numbers, such as those described for Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans: there are no indications for deviation from a Poisson distribution, there is a low occupancy per insertion site, and genetic drift has no apparent effect on the frequency distribution. We propose that the unusual distribution found in the populations from the Iberian Peninsula is a consequence of the colonization process. Iberian Peninsula populations suffered a genomic redistribution of Osvaldo, most probably after a founder effect. Consequently, certain copies that arrived at high frequencies are showing a high occupancies today, and the mean copy number of Osvaldo is higher in Iberian Peninsula populations than in populations from Argentina.

Results of these tests are known to be influenced, in an undetermined manner, by the mating propensity of competitors and by discriminatory factors during courtship. We have approached the problem by measuring male and female propensities in separate, independent tests, and by examining whether these estimates could explain the results of the choice tests. First, male and female choice tests were used to measure sexual isolation between populations of Drosophila melanogaster and between populations of D. simulans. Significant deviations from random mating occurred in 31 out of 48 tests, in agreement with the propensity values of the tested genotypes. We conclude that mating propensity instead of discrimination is directly involved in the estimation of sexual isolation in our populations, and advise against the application of male and female choice tests to assess intraspecific isolation without a proper knowledge of the mating propensities of competing individuals. Second, multiple choice tests were used to assess isolation between D. melanogaster populations. In examining the dynamics of matings throughout the test, we show that if competing individuals differ in mating propensities and tests are long enough to allow most matings to happen, a spurious sexual isolation can appear. We recommend that multiple choice tests be terminated once 50 percent of matings had been observed.",1998,"Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros, Pelayo Casares, Maria C Carracedo, Beatriz Del Rio, Rafael Pineiro, Lucia Garcia-Florez, Ana R Barros"

As an approach toward understanding the contributions of particular conductances to olfactory neuron excitability and odor discrimination, we have investigated the role of the putative cyclic nucleotide-modulated K+ channel subunit encoded by the ether a go-go (eag) gene in odorant responsiveness in Drosophila melanogaster. Four independent mutant eag alleles exhibited reduced antennal sensitivity to a subset of nine odorants, all having short aliphatic side chains: ethyl butyrate (EB), propionic acid, 2-butanone, and ethyl acetate. Significantly fewer eag antennal neurons responded to EB compared with control neurons; the proportion sensitive to 2-heptanone was similar to controls. Two aspects of the character of EB-induced excitability were affected by mutations in eag. First, fewer EB-induced inhibitory responses were observed in eag mutants, and second, fewer excitatory odorant responses dependent on extracellular Ca2+ were observed. Furthermore, modulation of neuronal excitability by membrane-permeant cyclic nucleotide analogs was largely eag dependent. Focal application of high K+ saline to sensillae altered the excitability of the majority of neurons from wild-type but not eag antennae, suggesting that Eag may have a dendritic localization.",1998,"A E Dubin, M M Liles, G L Harris, A E Dubin, M M Liles, G L Harris"

A cytological phenotype was observed in the salivary gland chromosomes of larvae homozygous and hemizygous for Su(UR)ES: (i) in the IH regions, that normally are incompletely polytenized and so they often break to form ""weak points,"" underreplication is suppressed, breaks and ectopic contacts disappear; (ii) the degree of polytenization in PH grows higher. That is why the regions in chromosome arm basements, normally beta-heterochromatic, acquire a distinct banding pattern, i. e., become euchromatic by morphological criteria; (iii) an additional bulk of polytenized material arises between the arms of chromosome 3 to form a fragment with a typical banding pattern.

Cis-acting sequences contributing to expression of the Drosophila affinidisjuncta Adh gene in both larvae and adults,9818387,10.1016/s0965-1748(98)00072-1,"To characterize the cis-acting sequences required for expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene of the Hawaiian picture-winged fruit fly Drosophila affinidisjuncta, germ-line transformation was used to introduce altered forms of this gene into Drosophila melanogaster. Genes were constructed lacking regions corresponding to known or putative regulatory elements within the D. melanogaster gene as well as to sequences previously shown to be required for expression of the D. affinidisjuncta gene in the larval fat body as assayed by transient transformation. Measurement of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) activity levels produced by the transfected genes indicates that multiple elements in both the 5' and 3' regions of the gene contribute to expression. The dispersed elements appear to function redundantly to ensure high levels of expression. Moreover, in contrast to what has been reported for other Drosophila Adh genes, some of the regulatory elements influence expression in both larvae and adults. In total, these results reveal a regulatory system in which the transcribed region in imbedded in an extended genomic segment rich in cisacting regulatory information.",1998,"R W McKenzie, M D Brennan, R W McKenzie, M D Brennan"
Interaction between Drosophila EGF receptor and vnd determines three dorsoventral domains of the neuroectoderm,9716528,,"Neurogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster starts by an ordered appearance of neuroblasts arranged in three columns (medial, intermediate and lateral) in each side of the neuroectoderm. Here we show that, in the intermediate column, the receptor tyrosine kinase DER represses expression of proneural genes, achaete and scute, and is required for the formation of neuroblasts. Most of the early function of DER is likely to be mediated by the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway, which is activated in the intermediate column, since a loss of a component of this pathway leads to a phenotype identical to that in DER mutants. MAP-kinase activation was also observed in the medial column where esg and proneural gene expression is unaffected by DER. We found that the homeobox gene vnd is required for the expression of esg and scute in the medial column, and show that vnd acts through the negative regulatory region of the esg enhancer that mediates the DER signal, suggesting the role of vnd is to counteract DER-dependent repression. Thus nested expression of vnd and the DER activator rhomboid is crucial to subdivide the neuroectoderm into the three dorsoventral domains.",1998,"Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi, Y Yagi, T Suzuki, S Hayashi"
CYTOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PREMEIOTIC VERSUS POSTMEIOTIC DEFECTS PRODUCING HYBRID MALE STERILITY AMONG SIBLING SPECIES OF THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER COMPLEX,28565214,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb01834.x,"In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybridizations between species of the Drosophila simulans clade produce fertile females but sterile males. In this study, a comprehensive characterization was undertaken on the six types of F1 males that were the result of the crosses between D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. With the use of light and electron microscopy, it was shown that while each particular hybrid genotype exhibited a specific sterility phenotype, these phenotypes fell into two distinct classes. The two hybrid genotypes that possessed D. mauritiana X-chromosomes contained spermatogenic defects that caused arrests in premeiotic spermatogenic stages. The other four F1 hybrids possessed postmeiotic spermatogenic defects. Nonsynchronous cell divisions, underdeveloped mitochondrial derivative-axonemal associations, and microtubule abnormalities were common to all of these hybrids. Each particular postmeiotically defective hybrid genotype demonstrated characteristically distinct profiles in sperm bundle number in addition to characteristic spermiogenic arrests in the furthest developed spermatids. These results in species hybrids contrast with the absence of significant differences in spermatogenic characters between species of this clade. In addition, by utilizing an attached-X cross, we investigated the influence of maternal effects and cytoplasmic factors on the sterility of D. simulans F1 hybrids and found none. However, we discovered a strain of D. simulans (2119) that caused a large shift in sterility from postmeiotic to premeiotic when crossed to D. sechellia. This suggests that D. simulans is polymorphic for genes involving premeiotic and postmeiotic sterility and that the two types of sterilities between species may have a simple genetic basis.",1998,"Rob Kulathinal, Rama S Singh, Rob Kulathinal, Rama S Singh"
An analysis of maleless and histone H4 acetylation in Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis,9507080,10.1016/s0925-4773(98)00009-4,"Maleless (mle) is essential in Drosophila melanogaster males both in somatic cells and in germ cells. In somatic cells mle is necessary for X-chromosome dosage compensation. The role of mle in the germline is unknown. We have analyzed the expression pattern and localization of MLE, the other MSLs and acetylated isoforms of histone H4 in male germ cells to address whether dosage compensation and/or X inactivation occur in the Drosophila germline. We observed that MLE is the only MSL expressed in the male germ cells and it is not localized to the X chromosome. We conclude that in the germline mle is not involved in chromosomal dosage compensation but may be involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. We also observed that the acetylation pattern of histone H4 is very dynamic during spermatogenesis. While the pattern is not compatible with dosage compensation or X inactivation, it is consistent with all premeiotic chromosomes being in an active configuration that is replaced in post-meiotic stages with an inactive chromatin constitution.",1998,"L Rastelli, M I Kuroda, L Rastelli, M I Kuroda"
Metabolic reserves and evolved stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,9754535,10.1086/515963,"We have examined starvation and desiccation resistance in 43 outbred populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have diverged from a common ancestral population as a result of a variety of defined selection protocols. The populations differ up to 8.5-fold in desiccation resistance and up to 10-fold in starvation resistance. We used these populations to search for evolved physiological changes that might explain the differences in stress resistance. We examined two hypotheses for increased stress resistance that had been proposed previously in the literature: (1) that increments in starvation resistance are principally the result of differential lipid accumulation, and (2) that changes in glycogen accumulation play a role in evolved increases in resistance to desiccation stress. By quantifying desiccation resistance, starvation resistance, lipid content, and carbohydrate content in each of our populations of flies, we were able to demonstrate strong correlations between the capacity of the flies to resist starvation and the quantity of lipid or carbohydrate that the flies had stored. The strongest correlation (R2 = 0.99) was observed when the total energy content of both the lipid and carbohydrate stores was regressed against starvation resistance. These results demonstrate that the flies responded to selection for starvation resistance through a genetically determined increase in both lipid and carbohydrate storage. Similar analyses of the correlation between lipid storage or total energy storage and desiccation resistance revealed no significant correlations. Carbohydrate storage was significantly correlated with desiccation resistance in female but not in male flies. These results suggest that different forms of stress are resisted with distinct physiological mechanisms and that the evolutionary response of the flies to stress selection is specific to the stress imposed.",1998,"M Djawdan, A K Chippindale, M R Rose, T J Bradley, M Djawdan, A K Chippindale, M R Rose, T J Bradley"

Potentially active copies of the gypsy retroelement are confined to the Y chromosome of some strains of Drosophila melanogaster possibly as the result of the female-specific effect of the flamenco gene,9541538,10.1007/pl00006323,"Gypsy is an endogenous retrovirus present in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. This element is mobilized only in the progeny of females which contain active gypsy elements and which are homozygous for permissive alleles of a host gene called flamenco (flam). Some data strongly suggest that gypsy elements bearing a diagnostic HindIII site in the central region of the retrovirus body represent a subfamily that appears to be much more active than elements devoid of this site. We have taken advantage of this structural difference to assess by the Southern blotting technique the genomic distribution of active gypsy elements. In some of the laboratory Drosophila stocks tested, active gypsy elements were found to be restricted to the Y chromosome. Further analyses of 14 strains tested for the permissive vs. restrictive status of their flamenco alleles suggest that the presence of permissive alleles of flam in a stock tends to be associated with the confinement of active gypsy elements to the Y chromosome. This might be the result of the female-specific effect of flamenco on gypsy activity.",1998,"F Chalvet, C di Franco, A Terrinoni, A Pelisson, N Junakovic, A Bucheton, F Chalvet, C di Franco, A Terrinoni, A Pelisson, N Junakovic, A Bucheton"
Nucleotide variation in the triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi) locus of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans,9615457,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025979,"DNA sequence variation in a 1.1-kb region including the coding portion of the Tpi locus was examined in 25 homozygous third-chromosome lines of Drosophila melanogaster, nine lines of Drosophila simulans, and one line of Drosophila yakuba. Our data show that the widespread allozyme polymorphism observed in cosmopolitan D. melanogaster is due to a glutamic acid substitution occurring in a phylogenetically conserved lysine that has been identified as part of the ""hinged-lid"" active site of the enzyme. This observation suggests that the replacement polymorphism may have important functional consequences. One replacement polymorphism was also observed in D. simulans, although its functional relevance is more difficult to assess, since it affects a site that is not strongly conserved. This amino acid change in D. simulans is associated with a single lineage possessing seven unique silent substitutions, which may be indicative of balancing selection or population subdivision. The absence of fixed amino acid differences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans and only a single difference with D. yakuba suggests that triose phosphate isomerase is under strong functional constraint. Silent variation is slightly higher for D. melanogaster than for D. simulans. Finally, we outline the general lack of evidence for old balanced polymorphisms at allozyme loci in D. melanogaster.",1998,"E Hasson, I N Wang, L W Zeng, M Kreitman, W F Eanes"

Silent molecular variation in the Slow allele was very different between standard chromosomes and chromosomes bearing the In(2L)t inversion. Within populations, inverted Slow haplotypes were more variable than standard Slow haplotypes. Between populations, geographical structure was almost nonexistent for inverted Slow haplotypes and highly significant for standard Slow. All Fast haplotypes occurred on standard chromosomes. They showed little variation within and between populations. They were highly significantly closer to standard Slow haplotypes from Europe. These results suggest that the current range of Fast and In(2L)t Slow haplotypes is recent and that an older genetic differentiation between populations was followed by allele-specific gene flow.",1998,"M Veuille, V BÃ©nassi, S Aulard, F Depaulis, M Veuille, V BÃ©nassi, S Aulard, F Depaulis"
High production of nondisjunction mutants in the offspring of Drosophila melanogaster females exposed to carbon dioxide at meiosis I,9544196,,"Drosophila melanogaster females homozygous for X-linked recessive markers, y and wi, were exposed to CO2 and mated with y+ w+/Y males. The progeny were sampled and inspected for y wi/y wi/Y (XXY) and y+ w+/O (XO) mutants. The frequency of nondisjunction XXY mutants after a 90-min exposure to CO2 increased 100-fold above the control level in the first-day brood but did not increase above the control level in the second to sixth broods, showing that CO2 is an extremely potent inducer of nondisjunction in mature oocytes during meiotic metaphase I but is not harmful to immature oocytes. Nondisjunction-causing damage induced by CO2 in mature oocytes disappeared completely within one day after CO2 treatment, as evidenced by a reduction of the number of XXY mutants to the control level when the mating of CO2-treated females was delayed by one day. CO2-induced nondisjunction is probably due to damage to spindle microtubules in mature oocytes at metaphase I. N2 is a less potent inducer of nondisjunction than CO2. Maternal X-irradiation with 4 Gy did not induce XXY mutants, showing that medium-level radiation does not induce nondisjunction. The results support Gaulden's hypothesis that oxygen deficits and CO2 increases in the microenvironment of mature oocytes can be potent inducers of nondisjunction.

N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea predominantly induces mutations at AT base pairs in pre-meiotic germ cells of Drosophila males,9717174,10.1093/mutage/13.4.375,"Molecular mutation spectra induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea have been obtained in several organisms and test systems, frequently showing different results. In Drosophila melanogaster this spectrum has been analyzed in postmeiotic stages, resulting in good agreement between the adduct spectrum and mutational events, the majority being GC-->AT transitions (61%). However, when collecting data about in vivo ENU-induced mutations in mouse germ cell stages mostly damage at A:T sites (89%) was observed. In this work we analyze the molecular spectrum induced with ENU in pre-meiotic repair-active male germ cells of D.melanogaster, using the specific locus test (SLT) with the vermilion locus as target. Results show that the most mutagenic sites in spermatogonial stem cells of Drosophila are A:T pairs (85%), with AT-->TA transversions (50%) and AT-->GC transitions (35%) as the most frequent mutations. Differences from the post-meiotic spectrum may be explained by the active repair of some adducts, such as O6-ethylguanine and N-alkyl-induced abasic sites. In addition, these results show the relevance of the minor lesions O4-ethylthymine and O2-ethylthymine in the production of mutations, as a consequence of their poor repair. Finally, since there is a striking similarity to the ENU-induced mutation spectrum in mouse, these results reveal that Drosophila continues to be an excellent model system.",1998,"L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Tosal, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"

RESOURCE ACQUISITION AND THE EVOLUTION OF STRESS RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565385,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02016.x,"Resistance to environmental stress is one of the most important forces molding the distribution and abundance of species. We investigated the evolution of desiccation stress resistance using 20 outbred Drosophila melanogaster populations directly selected in the laboratory for adult desiccation resistance (D), postponed senescence (O), and their respective controls (C and B). Both aging and desiccation selection increased desiccation resistance relative to their controls, creating a spectrum of desiccation resistance levels across selection treatments. We employed an integrative approach, merging data on the life histories of these populations with a detailed physiology of water balance. The physiological basis of desiccation resistance may be mechanisms enhancing either resource conservation or resource acquisition and allocation. Desiccation-resistant populations had increased water and carbohydrate stores, and showed age-specific patterns of desiccation resistance consistent with the resource accumulation mechanism. A significant proportion of the resources relevant to resistance of the stress were accumulated in the larval stage. Males and females of desiccation-selected lines exhibited distinctly different patterns of desiccation resistance and resource acquisition, in a manner suggesting intersexual antagonism in the evolution of stress resistance. Preadult viability of stress-selected populations was lower than that of controls, and development was slowed. Our results suggest that there is a cost to preadult resource acquisition, pointing out a complex trade-off architecture involving characters distributed across distinct life-cycle stages.",1998,"Adam K Chippindale, Allen G Gibbs, Mani Sheik, Kandice J Yee, Minou Djawdan, Timothy J Bradley, Michael R Rose, Adam K Chippindale, Allen G Gibbs, Mani Sheik, Kandice J Yee, Minou Djawdan, Timothy J Bradley, Michael R Rose"

A signaling protease required for melanization in Drosophila affects resistance and tolerance of infections,19071960,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060305,"Organisms evolve two routes to surviving infections-they can resist pathogen growth (resistance) and they can endure the pathogenesis of infection (tolerance). The sum of these two properties together defines the defensive capabilities of the host. Typically, studies of animal defenses focus on either understanding resistance or, to a lesser extent, tolerance mechanisms, thus providing little understanding of the relationship between these two mechanisms. We suggest there are nine possible pairwise permutations of these traits, assuming they can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in an independent manner. Here we show that by making a single mutation in the gene encoding a protease, CG3066, active in the melanization cascade in Drosophila melanogaster, we observe the full spectrum of changes; these mutant flies show increases and decreases in their resistance and tolerance properties when challenged with a variety of pathogens. This result implicates melanization in fighting microbial infections and shows that an immune response can affect both resistance and tolerance to infections in microbe-dependent ways. The fly is often described as having an unsophisticated and stereotypical immune response where single mutations cause simple binary changes in immunity. We report a level of complexity in the fly's immune response that has strong ecological implications. We suggest that immune responses are highly tuned by evolution, since selection for defenses that alter resistance against one pathogen may change both resistance and tolerance to other pathogens.",2008,"Janelle S Ayres, David S Schneider, Janelle S Ayres, David S Schneider"

How Drosophila melanogaster Forms its Mechanoreceptors,19471605,10.2174/138920208785133271,"A strictly determined number of external sensory organs, macrochaetes, acting as mechanoreceptors, are orderly located on drosophila head and body. Totally, they form the bristle pattern, which is a species-specific characteristic of drosophila.Each mechanoreceptor comprises four specialized cells derived from the single sensory organ precursor (SOP) cell. The conserved bristle pattern combined with a comparatively simple structure of each mechanosensory organ makes macrochaetes a convenient model for studying the formation spatial structures with a fixed number of elements at certain positions and the mechanism underlying cell differentiation.The macrochaete morphogenesis consists of three stages. At the first stage, the proneural clusters segregate from the massive of ectodermal cells of the wing imaginal disc. At the second stage, the SOP cell is determined and its position in the cluster is specified. At the third stage, the SOP cell undergoes two asymmetric divisions, and the daughter cells differentiate into the components of mechanoreceptor: shaft, socket, bipolar neuron, and sheath.The critical factor determining the neural pathway of cell development is the content of proneural proteins, products of the achaete-scute (AS-C) gene complex, reaching its maximum in the SOP cell.The experimental data on the main genes and their products involved in the control of bristle pattern formation are systematized. The roles of achaete-scute complex, EGFR and Notch signaling pathways, and selector genes in these processes are considered.

Drosophila egg-laying site selection as a system to study simple decision-making processes,18356529,10.1126/science.1151842,"The ability to select a better option from multiple acceptable ones is important for animals to optimize their resources. The mechanisms that underlie such decision-making processes are not well understood. We found that selection of egg-laying site in Drosophila melanogaster is a suitable system to probe the neural circuit that governs simple decision-making processes. First, Drosophila females pursue active probing of the environment before depositing each egg, apparently to evaluate site quality for every egg. Second, Drosophila females can either accept or reject a sucrose-containing medium, depending on the context. Last, communication of the ""acceptability"" of the sucrose-containing medium as an egg-laying option to the reproductive system depends on the function of a group of insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)-producing neurons.

In vivo detection of DNA adducts induced by cisplatin using capillary HPLC-ICP-MS and their correlation with genotoxic damage in Drosophila melanogaster,17932658,10.1007/s00216-007-1634-z,"The antitumoral effect of cisplatin [cis-diamminodichloroplatinum(II)] in mammals is related to its binding to DNA components. However, there is a lack of specific chemical methods to selectively detect those adducts formed in vivo at low concentrations. In this work, a new sensitive and selective method of determining cisplatin-DNA adducts based on the use of element-selective mass spectrometry is proposed, and the method is then applied to detect cisplatin adducts induced in vivo in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The bioanalytical strategy proposed here allows the determination of the most important DNA adduct formed between adjacent guanine units of the same DNA strand with cisplatin, and it is based on the coupling of capillary liquid chromatography (cap-LC) to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This set-up allows the simultaneous monitoring of the Pt (from the drug) and P (from the DNA components) present in these adducts, once they have been cleaved by enzymatic hydrolysis of the DNA samples. Using this instrumental set-up, the adducts of cisplatin formed in vivo when D. melanogaster flies are exposed to different cisplatin concentrations can be detected and their concentration determined. The results obtained show a direct correlation between the concentration of cisplatin adducts, the induced genotoxic damage (measured as DNA strand breaks using the Comet assay) and the cisplatin concentration.

"A role for Acp29AB, a predicted seminal fluid lectin, in female sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster",18757944,10.1534/genetics.108.092106,"Females of many animal species store sperm for taxon-specific periods of time, ranging from a few hours to years. Female sperm storage has important reproductive and evolutionary consequences, yet relatively little is known of its molecular basis. Here, we report the isolation of a loss-of-function mutation of the Drosophila melanogaster Acp29AB gene, which encodes a seminal fluid protein that is transferred from males to females during mating. Using this mutant, we show that Acp29AB is required for the normal maintenance of sperm in storage. Consistent with this role, Acp29AB localizes to female sperm storage organs following mating, although it does not appear to associate tightly with sperm. Acp29AB is a predicted lectin, suggesting that sugar-protein interactions may be important for D. melanogaster sperm storage, much as they are in many mammals. Previous association studies have found an effect of Acp29AB genotype on a male's sperm competitive ability; our findings suggest that effects on sperm storage may underlie these differences in sperm competition.

Developmental stage and level of codon usage bias in Drosophila,18755761,10.1093/molbev/msn189,"Codon usage bias (CUB) is a ubiquitous observation in molecular evolution. As a model, Drosophila has been particularly well-studied and indications show that selection at least partially controls codon usage, probably through selection for translational efficiency. Although many aspects of Drosophila CUB have been studied, this is the first study relating codon usage to development in this holometabolous insect with very different life stages. Here we ask the question: What developmental stage of Drosophila melanogaster has the greatest CUB? Genes with maximum expression in the larval stage have the greatest overall CUB when compared with embryos, pupae, and adults. (The same pattern was observed in Drosophila pseudoobscura, see Supplementary Material online.) We hypothesize this is related to the very rapid growth of larvae, placing increased selective pressure to produce large amounts of protein: a 300-fold increase requiring an approximate doubling of protein content every 10 h. Genes with highest expression in adult males and early embryos, stages with the least de novo protein synthesis, display the least CUB. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CUB is caused (at least in part) by selection for efficient protein production. This seems to hold on the individual gene level (highly expressed genes are more biased than lowly expressed genes) as well as on a more global scale where genes with maximum expression during times of very rapid growth and protein synthesis are more biased than genes with maximum expression during times of low growth.",2008,"Saverio Vicario, Christopher E Mason, Kevin P White, Jeffrey R Powell, Saverio Vicario, Christopher E Mason, Kevin P White, Jeffrey R Powell"
Molecular basis of dendritic arborization,18511961,,"The pattern of dendritic branching along with the receptor and channel composition and density of synapses regulate the electrical properties of neurons. Abnormalities in dendritic tree development lead to serious dysfunction of neuronal circuits and, consequently, the whole nervous system.

Identifying candidate genes affecting developmental time in Drosophila melanogaster: pervasive pleiotropy and gene-by-environment interaction,18687152,10.1186/1471-213X-8-78,"Background:
      
    

    
      Understanding the genetic architecture of ecologically relevant adaptive traits requires the contribution of developmental and evolutionary biology. The time to reach the age of reproduction is a complex life history trait commonly known as developmental time. In particular, in holometabolous insects that occupy ephemeral habitats, like fruit flies, the impact of developmental time on fitness is further exaggerated. The present work is one of the first systematic studies of the genetic basis of developmental time, in which we also evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the expression of the trait.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We analyzed 179 co-isogenic single P[GT1]-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster to identify novel genes affecting developmental time in flies reared at 25 degrees C. Sixty percent of the lines showed a heterochronic phenotype, suggesting that a large number of genes affect this trait. Mutant lines for the genes Merlin and Karl showed the most extreme phenotypes exhibiting a developmental time reduction and increase, respectively, of over 2 days and 4 days relative to the control (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line). In addition, a subset of 42 lines selected at random from the initial set of 179 lines was screened at 17 degrees C. Interestingly, the gene-by-environment interaction accounted for 52% of total phenotypic variance. Plastic reaction norms were found for a large number of developmental time candidate genes.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We identified components of several integrated time-dependent pathways affecting egg-to-adult developmental time in Drosophila. At the same time, we also show that many heterochronic phenotypes may arise from changes in genes involved in several developmental mechanisms that do not explicitly control the timing of specific events. We also demonstrate that many developmental time genes have pleiotropic effects on several adult traits and that the action of most of them is sensitive to temperature during development. Taken together, our results stress the need to take into account the effect of environmental variation and the dynamics of gene interactions on the genetic architecture of this complex life-history trait.",2008,"JuliÃ¡n Mensch, NicolÃ¡s Lavagnino, Valeria Paula Carreira, Ana Massaldi, Esteban Hasson, Juan JosÃ© Fanara, JuliÃ¡n Mensch, NicolÃ¡s Lavagnino, Valeria Paula Carreira, Ana Massaldi, Esteban Hasson, Juan JosÃ© Fanara"
The MSL3 chromodomain directs a key targeting step for dosage compensation of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome,19029895,10.1038/nsmb.1520,"The male-specific lethal (MSL) complex upregulates the single male X chromosome to achieve dosage compensation in Drosophila melanogaster. We have proposed that MSL recognition of specific entry sites on the X is followed by local targeting of active genes marked by histone H3 trimethylation (H3K36me3). Here we analyze the role of the MSL3 chromodomain in the second targeting step. Using ChIP-chip analysis, we find that MSL3 chromodomain mutants retain binding to chromatin entry sites but show a clear disruption in the full pattern of MSL targeting in vivo, consistent with a loss of spreading. Furthermore, when compared to wild type, chromodomain mutants lack preferential affinity for nucleosomes containing H3K36me3 in vitro. Our results support a model in which activating complexes, similarly to their silencing counterparts, use the nucleosomal binding specificity of their respective chromodomains to spread from initiation sites to flanking chromatin.",2008,"Tuba H Sural, Shouyong Peng, Bing Li, Jerry L Workman, Peter J Park, Mitzi I Kuroda, Tuba H Sural, Shouyong Peng, Bing Li, Jerry L Workman, Peter J Park, Mitzi I Kuroda"
Regulation of Abd-B expression by Cyclin G and Corto in the abdominal epithelium of Drosophila,18667003,10.1111/j.0018-0661.2008.02067.x,"Polycomb-group (PcG) and trithorax-group (trxG) genes encode important regulators of homeotic genes, repressors and activators, respectively. They act through epigenetic mechanisms that maintain chromatin structure. The corto gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a co-factor of these regulators belonging to the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb class. We have previously shown that Corto maintains the silencing of the homeotic gene Abdominal-B in the embryo and that it interacts with a cyclin, Cyclin G, suggesting that it could be a major actor in the connection between Polycomb/Trithorax function and the cell cycle. We show here that inactivation of Cyclin G by RNA interference leads to rotated genitalia and cuticle defects in the posterior abdomen of pupae and that corto genetically interacts with Cyclin G for generating these phenotypes. Examination of these pupae shows that development of the dorsal histoblast nests that will give rise to the adult epithelium is impaired in the posterior segments which identity is specified by Abdominal-B. Using a line that expresses LacZ in the Abdominal-B domain, we show that corto maintains Abdominal-B repression in the pupal epithelium whereas Cyclin G maintains its activation. These results prompt us to propose that the interaction between the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb Corto and Cyclin G is involved in regulating the balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation during abdominal epithelium development.",2008,"Juliette Salvaing, EmmanuÃ¨le Mouchel-Vielh, SÃ©bastien Bloyer, Anette Preiss, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Peronnet, Juliette Salvaing, EmmanuÃ¨le Mouchel-Vielh, SÃ©bastien Bloyer, Anette Preiss, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Peronnet"
Courtship initiation is stimulated by acoustic signals in Drosophila melanogaster,18802468,10.1371/journal.pone.0003246,"Finding a mating partner is a critical task for many organisms. It is in the interest of males to employ multiple sensory modalities to search for females. In Drosophila melanogaster, vision is thought to be the most important courtship stimulating cue at long distance, while chemosensory cues are used at relatively short distance. In this report, we show that when visual cues are not available, sounds produced by the female allow the male to detect her presence in a large arena. When the target female was artificially immobilized, the male spent a prolonged time searching before starting courtship. This delay in courtship initiation was completely rescued by playing either white noise or recorded fly movement sounds to the male, indicating that the acoustic and/or seismic stimulus produced by movement stimulates courtship initiation, most likely by increasing the general arousal state of the male. Mutant males expressing tetanus toxin (TNT) under the control of Gr68a-GAL4 had a defect in finding active females and a delay in courtship initiation in a large arena, but not in a small arena. Gr68a-GAL4 was found to be expressed pleiotropically not only in putative gustatory pheromone receptor neurons but also in mechanosensory neurons, suggesting that Gr68a-positive mechanosensory neurons, not gustatory neurons, provide motion detection necessary for courtship initiation. TNT/Gr68a males were capable of discriminating the copulation status and age of target females in courtship conditioning, indicating that female discrimination and formation of olfactory courtship memory are independent of the Gr68a-expressing neurons that subserve gustation and mechanosensation. This study suggests for the first time that mechanical signals generated by a female fly have a prominent effect on males' courtship in the dark and leads the way to studying how multimodal sensory information and arousal are integrated in behavioral decision making.",2008,"Aki Ejima, Leslie C Griffith, Aki Ejima, Leslie C Griffith"
Elevated levels of expression associated with regions of the Drosophila genome that lack crossing over,18782733,10.1098/rsbl.2008.0376,"The recombinational environment influences patterns of molecular evolution through the effects of Hill-Robertson interference. Here, we examine genome-wide patterns of gene expression with respect to recombinational environment in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that regions of the genome lacking crossing over exhibit elevated levels of expression, and this is most pronounced for genes on the entirely non-crossing over fourth chromosome. We find no evidence for differences in the patterns of gene expression between regions of high, intermediate and low crossover frequencies. These results suggest that, in the absence of crossing over, selection to maintain control of expression may be compromised, perhaps due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations in regulatory regions. Alternatively, higher gene expression may be evolving to compensate for defective protein products or reduced translational efficiency.",2008,"Penelope R Haddrill, Fergal M Waldron, Brian Charlesworth, Penelope R Haddrill, Fergal M Waldron, Brian Charlesworth"
Genomic analysis of adaptive differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,18493064,10.1534/genetics.107.083659,"Drosophila melanogaster shows clinal variation along latitudinal transects on multiple continents for several phenotypes, allozyme variants, sequence variants, and chromosome inversions. Previous investigation suggests that many such clines are due to spatially varying selection rather than demographic history, but the genomic extent of such selection is unknown. To map differentiation throughout the genome, we hybridized DNA from temperate and subtropical populations to Affymetrix tiling arrays. The dense genomic sampling of variants and low level of linkage disequilibrium in D. melanogaster enabled identification of many small, differentiated regions. Many regions are differentiated in parallel in the United States and Australia, strongly supporting the idea that they are influenced by spatially varying selection. Genomic differentiation is distributed nonrandomly with respect to gene function, even in regions differentiated on only one continent, providing further evidence for the role of selection. These data provide candidate genes for phenotypes known to vary clinally and implicate interesting new processes in genotype-by-environment interactions, including chorion proteins, proteins regulating meiotic recombination and segregation, gustatory and olfactory receptors, and proteins affecting synaptic function and behavior.

Plasticity in mRNA expression and localization of orthodenticle within higher Diptera,19021740,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2008.00283.x,"orthodenticle (otd) genes are found throughout the animal kingdom and encode well-studied homeodomain transcription factors that share conserved functions in cephalization, head segmentation, brain patterning, and the differentiation of photoreceptors. Otd proteins have been proposed as ancestral key players in anterior determination despite a high level of variation in gene expression at early developmental stages: otd is expressed strictly zygotically in the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster, while otd1 mRNA is contributed maternally to the embryo in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum and maternal otd1 mRNA is localized to the anterior and posterior pole of the oocyte in the hymopteran Nasonia vitripennis. Here we demonstrate that such changes in otd mRNA expression and localization do not need to represent large phylogenetic distances but can occur even within closely related taxa.

Here we have investigated the translation mechanism of the dicistronic Adh-Adhr mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster. The data indicate that the full-length intergenic spacer strongly enhances translation of the internal ORF of dicistronic reporters, both in S2 cells and adult flies. Interestingly, transcripts derived from intron-containing constructs gave rise to higher translation yields, suggesting a link between pre-mRNA splicing and efficient internal translation initiation.",2008,"Preethi Ramanathan, Jiannan Guo, Rebekah N Whitehead, Saverio Brogna, Preethi Ramanathan, Jiannan Guo, Rebekah N Whitehead, Saverio Brogna"
"Interactions between injury, stress resistance, reproduction, and aging in Drosophila melanogaster",18053668,10.1016/j.exger.2007.10.006,"An important aspect of the aging process in Drosophila melanogaster is the natural loss of antennae, legs, bristles, and parts of wings with age. These injuries lead to a loss of hemolymph, which contains water and nutrients. Stress-resistant lines of D. melanogaster are sometimes longer-lived than the populations from which they are derived. One hypothesis tested here is that increased stress-resistance fosters longevity because it allows fruit flies to cope with the loss of hemolymph due to injury to the aging fly. We tested the effects of surgically induced injury on the aging and reproduction of five replicate populations. We then tested the effects of injury on populations that had been selected for different levels of stress resistance and on control populations. Injury affected aging more in males than in females, in part because of a counter-balancing reduction in female reproduction brought about by injury. More specifically, injury reduced female fecundity and male virility. Injury significantly reduced the starvation resistance in some groups of flies, but not in others. These findings undermine any simple interpretation of the interactions between injury, reproduction, and aging based on stress resistance. But they do indicate the existence of significant interactions between these biological processes, interactions that should be resolved in greater mechanistic detail than has been managed here.",2008,"Sean Sepulveda, Parvin Shojaeian, Casandra L Rauser, Mahtab Jafari, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose, Sean Sepulveda, Parvin Shojaeian, Casandra L Rauser, Mahtab Jafari, Laurence D Mueller, Michael R Rose"
Identification and characterization of the nuclear isoform of Drosophila melanogaster CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase,18922025,10.1021/bi801161s,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyzes the conversion of phosphocholine and cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) to CDP-choline for the eventual synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC). The enzyme is regulated by reversible association with cellular membranes, with the rate of catalysis increasing following membrane association. Two isoforms of CCT appear to be present in higher eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster, which contains the tandem genes Cct1 and Cct2. Before this study, the CCT1 isoform had not been characterized and the cellular location of each enzyme was unknown. In this investigation, the cDNA encoding the CCT1 isoform from D. melanogaster has been cloned and the recombinant enzyme purified and characterized to determine catalytic properties and the effect of lipid vesicles on activity. CCT1 exhibited a V max of 23904 nmol of CDP-choline min (-1) mg (-1) and apparent K m values for phosphocholine and CTP of 2.29 and 1.21 mM, respectively, in the presence of 20 muM PC/oleate vesicles. Cytidylyltransferases require a divalent cation for catalysis, and the cation preference of CCT1 was found to be as follows: Mg (2+) > Mn (2+) = Co (2+) > Ca (2+) = Ni (2+) > Zn (2+). The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by a variety of lipids, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, diphosphatidylglycerol, and the fatty acid oleate. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid, however, did not have a significant effect on CCT1 activity.

Mating frequency and inclusive fitness in Drosophila melanogaster,18171147,10.1086/523944,"In many species, increased mating frequency reduces maternal survival and reproduction. In order to understand the evolution of mating frequency, we need to determine the consequences of increased mating frequency for offspring. We conducted an experiment in Drosophila melanogaster in which we manipulated the mating frequency of mothers and examined the survival and fecundity of the mothers and their daughters. We found that mothers with the highest mating frequency had accelerated mortality and more rapid reproductive senescence. On average, they had 50% shorter lives and 30% lower lifetime reproductive success (LRS) than did mothers with the lowest mating frequency. However, mothers with the highest mating frequency produced daughters with 28% greater LRS. This finding implies that frequent mating stimulates cross-generational fitness trade-offs such that maternal fitness is reduced while offspring fitness is enhanced. We evaluate these results using a demographic metric of inclusive fitness. We show that the costs and benefits of mating frequency depend on the growth rate of the population. In an inclusive fitness context, there was no evidence that increased mating frequency results in fitness costs for mothers. These results indicate that cross-generational fitness trade-offs have an important role in sexual selection and life-history evolution.",2008,"Nicholas K Priest, Laura F Galloway, Deborah A Roach, Nicholas K Priest, Laura F Galloway, Deborah A Roach"

During this period we sampled flies every 6h and measured their ability to survive heat and cold shock. There was a significant positive correlation between field temperature and heat shock survival and a significant negative correlation between field temperature and cold shock survival indicating that D. melanogaster are constantly adapting to their surrounding environment.

Circadian regulation of a limited set of conserved microRNAs in Drosophila,18284684,10.1186/1471-2164-9-83,"Background:
      
    

    
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that target mRNAs to control gene expression by attenuating the translational efficiency and stability of transcripts. They are found in a wide variety of organisms, from plants to insects and humans. Here, we use Drosophila to investigate the possibility that circadian clocks regulate the expression of miRNAs.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used a microarray platform to survey the daily levels of D. melanogaster miRNAs in adult heads of wildtype flies and the arrhythmic clock mutant cyc01. We find two miRNAs (dme-miR-263a and -263b) that exhibit robust daily changes in abundance in wildtype flies that are abolished in the cyc01 mutant. dme-miR-263a and -263b reach trough levels during the daytime, peak during the night and their levels are constitutively elevated in cyc01 flies. A similar pattern of cycling is also observed in complete darkness, further supporting circadian regulation. In addition, we identified several miRNAs that appear to be constitutively expressed but nevertheless differ in overall daily levels between control and cyc01 flies.

      The circadian clock regulates miRNA expression in Drosophila, although this appears to be highly restricted to a small number of miRNAs.

Our results suggest that cycling miRNAs contribute to daily changes in mRNA and/or protein levels in Drosophila.

An exciting new study examines metazoan mRNA export from a global perspective through the use of a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster. This screen identified several novel factors that contribute to mRNA export while reaffirming the strong evolutionary conservation that exists between Drosophila and yeast homologs that are essential for mRNA export.

In this study, we tested (1) whether SP-induced changes in gene expression affect the ability of females to kill injected non-pathogenic bacteria and (2) how the injection process per se affects the expression of AMP genes relative to SP. The ability of virgin females and females mated to SP lacking or control males to clear bacteria was assayed using an established technique in which Escherichia coli are injected directly into the fly body and the rate of clearance of the injected bacteria is determined. We found no repeatable differences in clearance rates between virgin females and females mated to SP producing or SP lacking males. However, we found that the piercing of the integument, as occurs during injection, up-regulates AMP gene expression much more strongly than SP.

      The study of P element repression in Drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of the telomeric Trans-Silencing Effect (TSE), a homology-dependent repression mechanism by which a P-transgene inserted in subtelomeric heterochromatin (Telomeric Associated Sequences, ""TAS"") has the capacity to repress in trans, in the female germline, a homologous P-lacZ transgene located in euchromatin. TSE can show variegation in ovaries, displays a maternal effect as well as an epigenetic transmission through meiosis and involves heterochromatin and RNA silencing pathways.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      Here, we analyze phenotypic and genetic properties of TSE. We report that TSE does not occur in the soma at the adult stage, but appears restricted to the female germline. It is detectable during development at the third instar larvae where it presents the same tissue specificity and maternal effect as in adults. Transgenes located in TAS at the telomeres of the main chromosomes can be silencers which in each case show the maternal effect. Silencers located at non-homologous telomeres functionally interact since they stimulate each other via the maternally-transmitted component. All germinally-expressed euchromatic transgenes tested, located on all major chromosomes, were found to be repressed by a telomeric silencer: thus we detected no TSE escaper. The presence of the euchromatic target transgene is not necessary to establish the maternal inheritance of TSE, responsible for its epigenetic behavior. A single telomeric silencer locus can simultaneously repress two P-lacZ targets located on different chromosomal arms.
    

    
  


        Conclusions and significance:
      
    

    
      Therefore TSE appears to be a widespread phenomenon which can involve different telomeres and work across the genome.

While the addition of negatively charged residues in the N-terminal extension could partially rationalize the improvement in the solubility of these constructs, conventional parameters like the proportion of order promoting residues or aliphatic index did not correlate with the improved biochemical characteristics.

[Molecular and genetic description of a new hypomorphic mutation of Trithorax-like gene and analysis of its effect on Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis],18669295,,"The Trithorax-like (Trl) gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes the multifunctional protein GAGA involved in many cellular processes. We have isolated and described a new hypomorphic mutation of the Trl gene--Trl(en82). The mutation is the insertion of a 1.4 kb P-element into the 5' untranslated region. Trl expression decreased in the ovaries of mutant flies by about 30%; however, it caused abnormalities. The Trl(en82) mutation combined with the null allele of Trl caused female sterility: the females laid a few small eggs with abnormal shape. Many egg chambers demonstrated abnormalities in the Trl(en82) mutants: the oocyte had a regular shape and intruded into the egg chamber region with nurse cells; the rapid transport of nurse cell cytoplasm into the oocyte was disturbed, which resulted in the ""dumpless"" phenotype of the chambers in mutants; follicular cells often did not completely cover the oocyte and concentrated on its posterior end; and the migration of centripetal cells was affected. We propose that the sterility of the Trl(en82) females is due to the abnormal functioning of follicular cells resulting from low Trl expression. This proposal is confirmed by normalizing the mutant phenotype of Trl(en82) females after the transfection of Trl cDNA.

Max-independent functions of Myc in Drosophila melanogaster,19165923,10.1038/ng.178,"Myc proteins are powerful proto-oncoproteins and important promoters of growth and proliferation during normal development. They are thought to exercise their effects upon binding to their partner protein Max, and their activities are largely antagonized by complexes of Max with Mnt or an Mxd family protein. Although the biological functions of Myc, Mxd and Mnt have been intensively studied, comparatively little is known about the in vivo role of Max. Here we generate Max loss-of-function and reduction-of-function mutations in Drosophila melanogaster to address the contribution of Max to Myc-dependent growth control. We find that many biological activities of Myc do not, or only partly, require the association with Max--for example, the control of endoreplication and cell competition-and that a Myc mutant that does not interact with Max retains substantial biological activity. We further show that Myc can control RNA polymerase III independently of Max, which explains some of Myc's observed biological activities. These studies show the ability of Myc to function independently of Max in vivo and thus change the current model of Max network function.",2008,"Dominik Steiger, Michael Furrer, Daniela Schwinkendorf, Peter Gallant, Dominik Steiger, Michael Furrer, Daniela Schwinkendorf, Peter Gallant"
Establishment of cell fate during early Drosophila embryogenesis requires transcriptional Mediator subunit dMED31,18083158,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.11.019,"During early Drosophila embryogenesis, formation of the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis depends on spatial gradients of maternal morphogens. It is well recognized that positional information is transmitted from these morphogens to the gap genes. However, how this information is being transmitted is largely unknown. The transcriptional Mediator complex is involved in the fine tuning of the signaling between chromatin status, transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. We found that a mutation in the conserved subunit of the Mediator complex, dMED31, hampers embryogenesis prior to gastrulation and leads to aberrant expression of the gap genes knirps and KrÃ¼ppel and the pair-rule genes fusi tarazu and even-skipped along the A/P axis. Expression of the maternal morphogens dorsal and hunchback was not affected in dMED31 mutants. mRNA expression of dMED31 exactly peaks between the highest expression levels of the maternal genes and the gap genes. Together, our results point to a role for dMED31 in guiding maternal morphogen directed zygotic gap gene expression and provide the first in vivo evidence for a role of the Mediator complex in the establishment of cell fate during the cellular blastoderm stage of Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"Floris Bosveld, Sjoerd van Hoek, Ody C M Sibon, Floris Bosveld, Sjoerd van Hoek, Ody C M Sibon"
A glial amino-acid transporter controls synapse strength and courtship in Drosophila,18066061,10.1038/nn2019,"Mate choice is an evolutionarily critical decision that requires the detection of multiple sex-specific signals followed by central integration of these signals to direct appropriate behavior. The mechanisms controlling mate choice remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the glial amino-acid transporter genderblind controls whether Drosophila melanogaster males will attempt to mate with other males. Genderblind (gb) mutant males showed no alteration in heterosexual courtship or copulation, but were attracted to normally unappealing male species-specific chemosensory cues. As a result, genderblind mutant males courted and attempted to copulate with other Drosophila males. This homosexual behavior could be induced within hours using inducible RNAi, suggesting that genderblind controls nervous system function rather than its development. Consistent with this, and indicating that glial genderblind regulates ambient extracellular glutamate to suppress glutamatergic synapse strength in vivo, homosexual behavior could be turned on and off by altering glutamatergic transmission pharmacologically and/or genetically.",2008,"Yael Grosjean, Micheline Grillet, Hrvoje Augustin, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, David E Featherstone, Yael Grosjean, Micheline Grillet, Hrvoje Augustin, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, David E Featherstone"

The identities of the NM_143151 gene product as NAD+-dependent SSADH and of the Aldh gene product as NAD+-dependent non-specific aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, EC1.2.1.3) were established by substrate specificity studies using 30 different aldehydes. In the case of D. melanogaster MalE-SSADH, the Michaelis constants (K(M)s) for the specific substrates succinic semialdehyde and NAD+ was 4.7 and 90.9 microM, respectively. For D. melanogaster MalE-ALDH the K(M) of the putative in vivo substrate acetaldehyde was 0.9 microM while for NAD+, a K(M) of 62.7 microM was determined.

Through a mosaic genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified a role in Notch signaling for a conserved thiol oxidase, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) oxidoreductin 1-like (Ero1L). Although Ero1L is reported to play a widespread role in protein folding in yeast, in flies Ero1L mutant clones show specific defects in lateral inhibition and inductive signaling, two characteristic processes regulated by Notch signaling. Ero1L mutant cells accumulate high levels of Notch protein in the ER and induce the unfolded protein response, suggesting that Notch is misfolded and fails to be exported from the ER. Biochemical assays demonstrate that Ero1L is required for formation of disulfide bonds of three Lin12-Notch repeats (LNRs) present in the extracellular domain of Notch.

"DNA damage response and repair in perspective: Aedes aegypti, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens",31711518,10.1186/s13071-019-3792-1,"Background:
      
    

    
      The maintenance of genomic integrity is the responsibility of a complex network, denominated the DNA damage response (DDR), which controls the lesion detection and DNA repair. The main repair pathways are base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination repair (HR) and non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ). They correct double-strand breaks (DSB), single-strand breaks, mismatches and others, or when the damage is quite extensive and repair insufficient, apoptosis is activated.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study we used the BLAST reciprocal best-hit methodology to search for DDR orthologs proteins in Aedes aegypti. We also provided a comparison between Ae. aegypti, D. melanogaster and human DDR network.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our analysis revealed the presence of ATR and ATM signaling, including the H2AX ortholog, in Ae. aegypti. Key DDR proteins (orthologs to RAD51, Ku and MRN complexes, XP-components, MutS and MutL) were also identified in this insect. Other proteins were not identified in both Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster, including BRCA1 and its partners from BRCA1-A complex, TP53BP1, PALB2, POLk, CSA, CSB and POLÎ². In humans, their absence affects DSB signaling, HR and sub-pathways of NER and BER. Seven orthologs not known in D. melanogaster were found in Ae. aegypti (RNF168, RIF1, WRN, RAD54B, RMI1, DNAPKcs, ARTEMIS).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of key DDR proteins in Ae. aegypti suggests that the main DDR pathways are functional in this insect, and the identification of proteins not known in D. melanogaster can help fill gaps in the DDR network. The mapping of the DDR network in Ae. aegypti can support mosquito biology studies and inform genetic manipulation approaches applied to this vector.",2019,"Maria Beatriz S Mota, Marcelo Alex Carvalho, Alvaro N A Monteiro, Rafael D Mesquita, Maria Beatriz S Mota, Marcelo Alex Carvalho, Alvaro N A Monteiro, Rafael D Mesquita"
Near-Infrared Hybrid Rhodol Dyes with Spiropyran Switches for Sensitive Ratiometric Sensing of pH Changes in Mitochondria and Drosophila melanogaster First-Instar Larvae,31912007,10.1021/acsabm.9b00710,"Near-infrared hybrid rhodol dyes (probes A and B) for sensitive ratiometric visualization of pH changes were prepared by incorporating hemicyanine dyes into traditional rhodol dyes. This approach was based on ?-conjugation changes involving a rhodol hydroxyl group as a spiropyran switch upon pH changes. Electronic spectra of probes A-2 and B-2 contain sharp absorption peaks at 535 nm and fluorescence peaks at 558 nm with similar ?-conjugation and a closed spiropyran form at a basic pH of 10.2. However, acidic pH conditions break down the hemiaminal ether groups, leading to indolenium moieties and significantly extending the ?-conjugation within the rhodol fluorophores, resulting in additional near-infrared emissions for probes A-1 and B-1. As a result, probes A and B exhibit gradual decreases of the absorption peaks at 535 nm and gradual increases in absorption peaks at 609 and 622 nm upon transition from basic to acidic pH, respectively. Both probes display ratiometric fluorescence sensing responses to pH downgrades from 10.2 to 3.6 with visible fluorescence decreases at 558 nm, as well as corresponding increases of the near-infrared fluorescence peaks at 688 and 698 nm, respectively. They exhibit fast, sensitive, and selective fluorescence responses with clearly defined ratiometric features to pH changes and show low cytotoxicity and excellent cell permeability.

The transcription factor Hey and nuclear lamins specify and maintain cell identity,31310235,10.7554/eLife.44745,"The inability of differentiated cells to maintain their identity is a hallmark of age-related diseases. We found that the transcription factor Hey supervises the identity of differentiated enterocytes (ECs) in the adult Drosophila midgut. Lineage tracing established that Hey-deficient ECs are unable to maintain their unique nuclear organization and identity. To supervise cell identity, Hey determines the expression of nuclear lamins, switching from a stem-cell lamin configuration to a differentiated lamin configuration. Moreover, continued Hey expression is required to conserve large-scale nuclear organization. During aging, Hey levels decline, and EC identity and gut homeostasis are impaired, including pathological reprograming and compromised gut integrity. These phenotypes are highly similar to those observed upon acute targeting of Hey or perturbation of lamin expression in ECs in young adults. Indeed, aging phenotypes were suppressed by continued expression of Hey in ECs, suggesting that a Hey-lamin network safeguards nuclear organization and differentiated cell identity.",2019,"Naama Flint Brodsly, Eliya Bitman-Lotan, Olga Boico, Adi Shafat, Maria Monastirioti, Manfred Gessler, Christos Delidakis, Hector Rincon-Arano, Amir Orian, Naama Flint Brodsly, Eliya Bitman-Lotan, Olga Boico, Adi Shafat, Maria Monastirioti, Manfred Gessler, Christos Delidakis, Hector Rincon-Arano, Amir Orian"

Various taste receptors such as gustatory receptors (GRs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), and pickpocket channels (PPKs) have been shown to have important roles in taste sensation. However, the mechanism underlying nicotine taste sensation has not been resolved in the insect model. Here we identify molecular receptors to detect the taste of nicotine and provide electrophysiological and behavioral evidence that gustatory receptors are required for avoiding nicotine-laced foods.

Targeted renal knockdown of Na +/H + exchanger regulatory factor Sip1 produces uric acid nephrolithiasis in Drosophila,31364377,10.1152/ajprenal.00551.2018,"Nephrolithiasis is one of the most common kidney diseases, with poorly understood pathophysiology, but experimental study has been hindered by lack of experimentally tractable models. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model organism for renal diseases because of genetic and functional similarities of Malpighian (renal) tubules with the human kidney. Here, we demonstrated function of the sex-determining region Y protein-interacting protein-1 (Sip1) gene, an ortholog of human Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF1), in Drosophila Malpighian tubules and its impact on nephrolithiasis. Abundant birefringent calculi were observed in Sip1 mutant flies, and the phenotype was also observed in renal stellate cell-specific RNA interference Sip1 knockdown in otherwise normal flies, confirming a renal etiology. This phenotype was abolished in rosy mutant flies (which model human xanthinuria) and by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, suggesting that the calculi were of uric acid. This was confirmed by direct biochemical assay for urate. Stones rapidly dissolved when the tubule was bathed in alkaline media, suggesting that Sip1 knockdown was acidifying the tubule. SIP1 was shown to collocate with Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2) and with moesin in stellate cells. Knockdown of NHE2 specifically to the stellate cells also increased renal uric acid stone formation, and so a model was developed in which SIP1 normally regulates NHE2 activity and luminal pH, ultimately leading to uric acid stone formation.

A single male auditory response test to quantify auditory behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster,31106644,10.1080/01677063.2019.1611805,"Many animals utilize auditory signals to communicate with conspecific individuals. During courtship, males of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and related species produce a courtship song comprised of sine and pulse songs by vibrating their wings. The pulse song increases female receptivity and male courtship activity, indicating that it functions as a sexual signal. One song parameter, interpulse interval (IPI), varies among closely related species. In D. melanogaster, a song with a conspecific IPI induces a stronger behavioral response than heterospecific songs, indicating the ability of the flies to discriminate conspecific IPI. Traditionally, the fly's response to the song is measured under grouped conditions, in which the effect of sensory modalities other than audition cannot be excluded. Here, to quantify the individual ability to discriminate a conspecific song, we systematically analyzed the auditory response of single male flies to sound with various parameters. Moreover, we applied this method, termed SMART (Single Male Auditory Response Test), to two sister species for potential application in a comparative approach. By quantifying the locomotor activity of single D. melanogaster males during sound exposure, we detected increased locomotor activity in response to pulse songs, but not to white noise or pure tone. The conspecific song evoked stronger response than the heterospecific songs, and ablation of their antennal receivers severely suppressed the locomotor increase. A pulse song with a small IPI variation evoked a continuous response, while the response to songs with highly variable IPIs tends to be rapidly decayed. This provides the first evidence that fruit flies discriminate IPI variations, which possibly inform the age and social contexts of the singer. Sister species, D. sechellia, exhibited a locomotor response to pulse song, while D. simulans exhibited no behavioral response. This suggests that auditory and other stimuli that elicit this behavioral response are diversified among Drosophila species.",2019,"Yuki Ishikawa, Natsuki Okamoto, Yusuke Yoneyama, Naoki Maeda, Azusa Kamikouchi, Yuki Ishikawa, Natsuki Okamoto, Yusuke Yoneyama, Naoki Maeda, Azusa Kamikouchi"

Toxic and Genotoxic Effects of Silver Nanoparticles in Drosophila,30353950,10.1002/em.22262,"The in vivo model Drosophila melanogaster was used here to determine the detrimental effects induced by silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exposure. The main aim was to explore its interaction with the intestinal barrier and the genotoxic effects induced in hemocytes. The observed effects were compared with those obtained by silver nitrate, as an agent acting via the release of silver ions. Larvae were fed in food media containing both forms of silver. Results indicated that silver nitrate was more toxic than AgNPs when the viability ""egg-to-adult"" was determined. Depigmentation was observed in adults including those exposed to nontoxic concentrations, as indicative of exposure action. Interestingly, AgNPs were able to cross the intestinal barrier affecting hemocytes that show significant increases in the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Additionally, significant levels of genotoxic damage, as determined by the comet assay, were also induced. When the expression of different stress-response genes was determined, for both AgNPs and silver nitrate, significant upregulation of Sod2 and p53 genes was observed. Our results confirm for the first time that in an in vivo model as Drosophila, AgNPs are able to cross the intestinal barriers and produce primary DNA damage (comet assay) via oxidative stress induction. In general, the effects induced by silver nitrate were more pronounced than those induced by AgNPs what would emphasize the role of silver ions in the observed effects. Environ. Mol.

Enabling cell-type-specific behavioral epigenetics in Drosophila: a modified high-yield INTACT method reveals the impact of social environment on the epigenetic landscape in dopaminergic neurons,30967153,10.1186/s12915-019-0646-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Epigenetic mechanisms play fundamental roles in brain function and behavior and stressors such as social isolation can alter animal behavior via epigenetic mechanisms. However, due to cellular heterogeneity, identifying cell-type-specific epigenetic changes in the brain is challenging. Here, we report the first use of a modified isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell type (INTACT) method in behavioral epigenetics of Drosophila melanogaster, a method we call mini-INTACT.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using ChIP-seq on mini-INTACT purified dopaminergic nuclei, we identified epigenetic signatures in socially isolated and socially enriched Drosophila males. Social experience altered the epigenetic landscape in clusters of genes involved in transcription and neural function. Some of these alterations could be predicted by expression changes of four transcription factors and the prevalence of their binding sites in several clusters. These transcription factors were previously identified as activity-regulated genes, and their knockdown in dopaminergic neurons reduced the effects of social experience on sleep.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our work enables the use of Drosophila as a model for cell-type-specific behavioral epigenetics and establishes that social environment shifts the epigenetic landscape in dopaminergic neurons. Four activity-related transcription factors are required in dopaminergic neurons for the effects of social environment on sleep.",2019,"Pavan Agrawal, Phuong Chung, Ulrike Heberlein, Clement Kent, Pavan Agrawal, Phuong Chung, Ulrike Heberlein, Clement Kent"
DNA Motifs Are Not General Predictors of Recombination in Two Drosophila Sister Species,30980655,10.1093/gbe/evz082,"Meiotic recombination is crucial for chromosomal segregation and facilitates the spread of beneficial and removal of deleterious mutations. Recombination rates frequently vary along chromosomes and Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a remarkable pattern. Recombination rates gradually decrease toward centromeres and telomeres, with a dramatic impact on levels of variation in natural populations. Two close sister species, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana do not only have higher recombination rates but also exhibit a much more homogeneous recombination rate that only drops sharply very close to centromeres and telomeres. Because certain sequence motifs are associated with recombination rate variation in D. melanogaster, we tested whether the difference in recombination landscape between D. melanogaster and D. simulans can be explained by the genomic distribution of recombination rate-associated sequence motifs. We constructed the first high-resolution recombination map for D. simulans based on 189 haplotypes from a natural D. simulans population and searched for short sequence motifs linked with higher than average recombination in both sister species. We identified five consensus motifs significantly associated with higher than average chromosome-wide recombination rates in at least one species and present in both. Testing fine resolution associations between motif density and recombination, we found strong and positive associations genome-wide over a range of scales in D. melanogaster, while the results were equivocal in D. simulans. Despite the strong association in D. melanogaster, we did not find a decreasing density of these short-repeat motifs toward centromeres and telomeres. We conclude that the density of recombination-associated repeat motifs cannot explain the large-scale recombination landscape in D. melanogaster, nor the differences to D. simulans. The strong association seen for the sequence motifs in D. melanogaster likely reflects their impact influencing local differences in recombination rates along the genome.",2019,"James M Howie, Rupert Mazzucco, Thomas Taus, Viola Nolte, Christian SchlÃ¶tterer"
Neurocalcin regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in Drosophila,30865587,10.7554/eLife.38114,"Sleep-like states in diverse organisms can be separated into distinct stages, each with a characteristic arousal threshold. However, the molecular pathways underlying different sleep stages remain unclear. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, exhibits consolidated sleep during both day and night, with night sleep associated with higher arousal thresholds compared to day sleep. Here we identify a role for the neuronal calcium sensor protein Neurocalcin (NCA) in promoting sleep during the night but not the day by suppressing nocturnal arousal and hyperactivity. We show that both circadian and light-sensing pathways define the temporal window in which NCA promotes sleep. Furthermore, we find that NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic release from a dispersed wake-promoting neural network and demonstrate that the mushroom bodies, a sleep-regulatory center, are a module within this network. Our results advance the understanding of how sleep stages are genetically defined.",2019,"Ko-Fan Chen, Simon Lowe, AngÃ©lique Lamaze, Patrick KrÃ¤tschmer, James Jepson, Ko-Fan Chen, Simon Lowe, AngÃ©lique Lamaze, Patrick KrÃ¤tschmer, James Jepson"
Recombinant deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster can improve gemcitabine based combined gene/chemotherapy for targeting cancer cells,30903745,10.17305/bjbms.2019.4136,"A recombinant deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster with a deletion of the last 20 amino acid residues (named DmdNK?C20) was hypothesized as a potential therapeutic tool for gene therapy due to its broad substrate specificity and better catalytic efficiency towards nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of DmdNK?C20 for sensitizing human cancer cell lines to gemcitabine and to further investigate its role in reversal of acquired drug resistance in gemcitabine-resistant cancer cell line. The DmdNK?C20 gene was delivered to three different cancer cell lines, including breast, colon and liver cancer cells, using lipid-mediated transfection reagent. After transfection, gene expression of DmdNK?C20 was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and the combined effect of DmdNK?C20 and gemcitabine based cytotoxicity was observed by cell viability assay. We further evolved a gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer cell line (named MCF7-R) through directed evolution in the laboratory, which showed 375-fold more resistance compared with parental MCF7 cells. Upon transfection with DmdNK?C20 gene, MCF7-R cells showed 83-fold higher sensitivity to gemcitabine compared with the control group of MCF7-R cells. Moreover, we observed 79% higher expression of p21 protein in transfected MCF7-R cells, which may indicate induction of apoptosis.

The Microtubule-Depolymerizing Kinesin-13 Klp10A Is Enriched in the Transition Zone of the Ciliary Structures of Drosophila melanogaster,31497602,10.3389/fcell.2019.00173,"The precursor of the flagellar axoneme is already present in the primary spermatocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. During spermatogenesis each primary spermatocyte shows a centriole pair that moves to the cell membrane and organizes an axoneme-based structure, the cilium-like region (CLR). The CLRs persist through the meiotic divisions and are inherited by young spermatids. During spermatid differentiation the ciliary caps elongate giving rise to the sperm axoneme. Mutations in Klp10A, a kinesin-13 of Drosophila, results in defects of centriole/CLR organization in spermatocytes and of ciliary cap assembly in elongating spermatids. Reduced Klp10A expression also results in strong structural defects of sensory type I neurons. We show, here, that this protein displays a peculiar localization during male gametogenesis. The Klp10A signal is first detected at the distal ends of the centrioles when they dock to the plasma membrane of young primary spermatocytes. At the onset of the first meiotic prometaphase, when the CLRs reach their full size, Klp10A is enriched in a distinct narrow area at the distal end of the centrioles and persists in elongating spermatids at the base of the ciliary cap. We conclude that Klp10A could be a core component of the ciliary transition zone in Drosophila.",2019,"Veronica Persico, Giuliano Callaini, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli, Veronica Persico, Giuliano Callaini, Maria Giovanna Riparbelli"

Gut yeasts do not improve desiccation survival in Drosophila melanogaster,31170408,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103893,"A healthy gut microbiota generally improves the performance of its insect host. Although the effects can be specific to the species composition of the microbial community, the role of gut microbiota in determining water balance has not been well explored. We used axenic and gnotobiotic (reared with a known microbiota) Drosophila melanogaster to test three hypotheses about the effects of gut yeasts on the water balance of adult flies: 1) that gut yeasts would improve desiccation survival in adult flies; 2) that larval yeasts would improve adult desiccation survival; 3) that the effects would be species-specific, such that yeasts closely associated with D. melanogaster in nature are more likely to be beneficial than those rarely found in association with D. melanogaster. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae (often used in Drosophila cultures, but rarely associated with D. melanogaster in nature), Lachancea kluyveri (associated with some species of Drosophila, but not D. melanogaster), and Pichia kluyveri (associated with D. melanogaster in nature). Adult inoculation with yeasts had no effect on survival of desiccating conditions. Inoculation with P. kluyveri as larvae did not change desiccation survival in adults; however, rearing with L. kluyveri or S. cerevisiae reduced adult desiccation survival. We conclude that adult inoculation with gut yeasts has no impact on desiccation survival, but that rearing with yeasts can have either no or detrimental effect. The effects appear to be species-specific: P. kluyveri did not have a negative impact on desiccation tolerance, suggesting some level of co-adaptation with D. melanogaster. We note that S. cerevisiae may not be an appropriate species for studying the effects of gut yeasts on D. melanogaster.",2019,"Joanne M Tang, Yanira JimÃ©nez-Padilla, Marc-AndrÃ© Lachance, Brent J Sinclair"

Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) facilitates metabolic characterisation of biological specimens by assaying the intrinsic autofluorescence of the ubiquitous coenzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. The potential of this method for characterising the diversity of organismal metabolism remains largely untapped. Using FLIM in Drosophila melanogaster, we show tissue-specificity in fluorescence lifetime that reflects variation in redox patterns. In particular, sperm cells exhibited elevated glycolysis relative to other tissues. We also show that sperm metabolism is phenotypically plastic: compared to male-stored sperm, sperm stored in the female's storage organ showed a substantial reduction in the protein-bound FAD lifetime fraction but no change in the NAD(P)H profile.

Regulation of the X Chromosome in the Germline and Soma of Drosophila melanogaster Males,29734690,10.3390/genes9050242,"During the evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the sex-specific Y chromosome degenerates, while the X chromosome evolves new mechanisms of regulation. Using bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we investigate the expression of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. We observe nearly complete X chromosome dosage compensation in male somatic tissues, but not in testis. The X chromosome contains disproportionately fewer genes with high expression in testis than the autosomes, even after accounting for the lack of dosage compensation, which suggests that another mechanism suppresses their expression in the male germline. This is consistent with studies of reporter genes and transposed genes, which find that the same gene has higher expression when autosomal than when X-linked. Using a new reporter gene that is expressed in both testis and somatic tissues, we find that the suppression of X-linked gene expression is limited to genes with high expression in testis and that the extent of the suppression is positively correlated with expression level.",2018,"Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch, Eliza Argyridou, John Parsch"
Synthetic Light-Activated Ion Channels for Optogenetic Activation and Inhibition,30333716,10.3389/fnins.2018.00643,"Optogenetic manipulation of cells or living organisms became widely used in neuroscience following the introduction of the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). ChR2 is a non-selective cation channel, ideally suited to depolarize and evoke action potentials in neurons. However, its calcium (Ca2+) permeability and single channel conductance are low and for some applications longer-lasting increases in intracellular Ca2+ might be desirable. Moreover, there is need for an efficient light-gated potassium (K+) channel that can rapidly inhibit spiking in targeted neurons. Considering the importance of Ca2+ and K+ in cell physiology, light-activated Ca2+-permeant and K+-specific channels would be welcome additions to the optogenetic toolbox. Here we describe the engineering of novel light-gated Ca2+-permeant and K+-specific channels by fusing a bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase to cyclic nucleotide-gated channels with high permeability for Ca2+ or for K+, respectively. Optimized fusion constructs showed strong light-gated conductance in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in rat hippocampal neurons. These constructs could also be used to control the motility of Drosophila melanogaster larvae, when expressed in motoneurons. Illumination led to body contraction when motoneurons expressed the light-sensitive Ca2+-permeant channel, and to body extension when expressing the light-sensitive K+ channel, both effectively and reversibly paralyzing the larvae. Further optimization of these constructs will be required for application in adult flies since both constructs led to eclosion failure when expressed in motoneurons.",2018,"Sebastian Beck, Jing Yu-Strzelczyk, Dennis Pauls, Oana M Constantin, Christine E Gee, Nadine Ehmann, Robert J Kittel, Georg Nagel, Shiqiang Gao, Sebastian Beck, Jing Yu-Strzelczyk, Dennis Pauls, Oana M Constantin, Christine E Gee, Nadine Ehmann, Robert J Kittel, Georg Nagel, Shiqiang Gao"

Imbalances in the gut microbiota (dysbiosis) due to diet, antibiotic use, age and stress contribute to disease development including diabetes, obesity, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammaging and neurodegeneration. Fortunately, a probiotic regime with a diet rich in prebiotics may reverse dysbiosis promoting health and wellness in age. The current study designs, optimizes and tests a novel probiotic and synbiotic formulation consisting of three metabolically active probiotics Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and Bifidobacteria infantis together with a novel polyphenol-rich prebiotic, Triphala. The prebiotic action of Triphala was characterized using in vitro batch cultures, Drosophila melanogaster and a simulated model of the human gastrointestinal tract (SHIME) where in each model, Triphala supported growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting pathogenic species.

We find a positive correlation between compositional skew and gene expression, comparable in strength to similar correlations between expression levels and genome-wide sequence features. This correlation is relatively stronger for germline, compared with somatic expression, consistent with the process of transcription-associated mutation bias.

Temporally specific engagement of distinct neuronal circuits regulating olfactory habituation in Drosophila,30576281,10.7554/eLife.39569,"Habituation is the process that enables salience filtering, precipitating perceptual changes that alter the value of environmental stimuli. To discern the neuronal circuits underlying habituation to brief inconsequential stimuli, we developed a novel olfactory habituation paradigm, identifying two distinct phases of the response that engage distinct neuronal circuits. Responsiveness to the continuous odor stimulus is maintained initially, a phase we term habituation latency and requires Rutabaga Adenylyl-Cyclase-depended neurotransmission from GABAergic Antennal Lobe Interneurons and activation of excitatory Projection Neurons (PNs) and the Mushroom Bodies. In contrast, habituation depends on the inhibitory PNs of the middle Antenno-Cerebral Track, requires inner Antenno-Cerebral Track PN activation and defines a temporally distinct phase. Collectively, our data support the involvement of Lateral Horn excitatory and inhibitory stimulation in habituation. These results provide essential cellular substrates for future analyses of the molecular mechanisms that govern the duration and transition between these distinct temporal habituation phases.

Flies were raised on diet supplement with GK seed for 5 days. The negative geotactic behavior of flies which was used to evaluate their locomotor performance was thereafter evaluated. The flies were subsequently homogenized and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase and glutathione?S?transferase (GST) activities, as well as nitric oxide (NO) and total thiol contents were assayed. The phytochemical constituents of GK seed were also determined. It was observed that higher dietary inclusions of GK seed reduced the survival rate of D. melanogaster more significantly compared to control flies. Also, higher dietary inclusions of GK seed significantly reduced locomotor performance and AChE activity, while the ROS level was increased compared to the control. Activities of GST and catalase were significantly increased in flies fed diet supplemented with higher GK seed inclusions but their NO content was significantly reduced compared to control. Phytochemical analysis of GK seed revealed abundance of saponin > glycosides > alkaloids > phenols > flavonoids. These results have shown that dietary inclusion of GK seed at higher concentrations reduced survival rate of D. melanogaster and impaired cholinergic system, with elevated activities of some antioxidant enzymes under acute exposure. These observations could be associated with bioactivities of predominant phytochemicals in GK seed such as saponin and glycosides which have been reportedly toxic at high concentration. Therefore, this study suggests that high consumption of GK seed could induce some toxicological effects and moderate consumption is hence recommended.",2018,"Ganiyu Oboh, Opeyemi B Ogunsuyi, Mopelola T Ojelade, Seun F Akomolafe"

Extending analyses in 3D, we find that near the pit of invagination, isotropic apical constriction leads to strong cell-wedging. Further from the pit cells interleave circumferentially, suggesting apically driven behaviours. Supporting this, junctional myosin is enriched in, and neighbour exchanges are biased towards the circumferential orientation. In a mutant failing pit specification, neither are biased due to an inactive pit.

The Wolbachia protein TomO interacts with a host RNA to induce polarization defects in Drosophila oocytes,29851149,10.1002/arch.21475,"Wolbachia is an endosymbiont prevalent in arthropods. To maximize its transmission thorough the female germline, Wolbachia induces in infected hosts male-to-female transformation, male killing, parthenogenesis, and cytoplasmic incompatibility, depending on the host species and Wolbachia strain involved. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these host manipulations by Wolbachia remain largely unknown. The Wolbachia strain wMel, an inhabitant of Drosophila melanogaster, impairs host oogenesis only when transplanted into a heterologous host, for example, Drosophila simulans. We found that egg polarity defects induced by wMel infection in D. simulans can be recapitulated in the natural host D. melanogaster by transgenic overexpression of a variant of the Wolbachia protein Toxic manipulator of oogenesis (TomO), TomOwMel?HS , in the female germline. RNA immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TomO physically associates with orb mRNA, which, as a result, fails to interact with the translation repressor Cup. This leads to precocious translation of Orb, a posterior determinant, and thereby to the misspecification of oocytes and accompanying polarity defects. We propose that the ability of TomO to bind to orb mRNA might provide a means for Wolbachia to enter the oocyte located at the posterior end of the egg chamber, thereby accomplishing secure maternal transmission thorough the female germline.",2018,"Manabu Ote, Daisuke Yamamoto, Manabu Ote, Daisuke Yamamoto"

The immune responses controlling RNA viruses in insects have been extensively studied, but the response to DNA virus infections is poorly characterized. Here, we report that infection of Drosophila with the DNA virus Invertebrate iridescent Virus 6 (IIV-6) triggers JAK-STAT signaling and the robust expression of the Turandots, a gene family encoding small secreted proteins. To drive JAK-STAT signaling, IIV-6 infection more immediately induced expression of the unpaireds, a family of IL-6-related cytokine genes, via a pathway that required one of the three Drosophila p38 homologs, p38b. In fact, both Stat92E and p38b were required for the survival of IIV-6 infected flies. In addition, in vitro induction of the unpaireds required an NADPH-oxidase, and in vivo studies demonstrated Nox was required for induction of TotA. These results argue that ROS production, triggered by IIV-6 infection, leads to p38b activation and unpaired expression, and subsequent JAK-STAT signaling, which ultimately protects the fly from IIV-6 infection.",2018,"Cara West, Neal Silverman, Cara West, Neal Silverman"
Quorum-sensing regulator RhlR but not its autoinducer RhlI enables Pseudomonas to evade opsonization,29523648,10.15252/embr.201744880,"When Drosophila melanogaster feeds on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, some bacteria cross the intestinal barrier and eventually proliferate in the hemocoel. This process is limited by hemocytes through phagocytosis. P. aeruginosa requires the quorum-sensing regulator RhlR to elude the cellular immune response of the fly. RhlI synthesizes the autoinducer signal that activates RhlR. Here, we show that rhlI mutants are unexpectedly more virulent than rhlR mutants, both in fly and in nematode intestinal infection models, suggesting that RhlR has RhlI-independent functions. We also report that RhlR protects P. aeruginosa from opsonization mediated by the Drosophila thioester-containing protein 4 (Tep4). RhlR mutant bacteria show higher levels of Tep4-mediated opsonization, as compared to rhlI mutants, which prevents lethal bacteremia in the Drosophila hemocoel. In contrast, in a septic model of infection, in which bacteria are introduced directly into the hemocoel, Tep4 mutant flies are more resistant to wild-type P. aeruginosa, but not to the rhlR mutant. Thus, depending on the infection route, the Tep4 opsonin can either be protective or detrimental to host defense.",2018,"Samantha Haller, Adrien Franchet, Abdul Hakkim, Jing Chen, Eliana Drenkard, Shen Yu, Stefanie Schirmeier, Zi Li, Nelson Martins, Frederick M Ausubel, Samuel LiÃ©geois, Dominique Ferrandon, Samantha Haller, Adrien Franchet, Abdul Hakkim, Jing Chen, Eliana Drenkard, Shen Yu, Stefanie Schirmeier, Zi Li, Nelson Martins, Frederick M Ausubel, Samuel LiÃ©geois, Dominique Ferrandon"

A role for Lin-28 in growth and metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster,29908237,10.1016/j.mod.2018.06.002,"Insect metamorphosis has been a classic model to understand the role of hormones in growth and timing of developmental transitions. In addition to hormones, transitions in some species are regulated by genetic programs, such as the heterochronic gene network discovered in C. elegans. However, the functional link between hormones and heterochronic genes is not clear. The heterochronic gene lin-28 is involved in the maintenance of stem cells, growth and developmental timing in vertebrates. In this work, we used gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to study the role of Lin-28 in larval growth and the timing of metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster. During the late third instar stage, Lin-28 is mainly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system and in the intestine. Loss-of-function lin-28 mutant larvae are smaller and the larval-to-pupal transition is accelerated. This faster transition correlates with increased levels of ecdysone direct target genes such as Broad-Complex (BR-C) and Ecdysone Receptor (EcR). Overexpression of Lin-28 does not affect the timing of pupariation but most animals are not able to eclose, suggesting defects in metamorphosis. Overexpression of human Lin-28 results in delayed pupariation and the death of animals during metamorphosis. Altogether, these results suggest that Lin-28 is involved in the control of growth during larval development and in the timing and progression of metamorphosis.",2018,"Sergio GonzÃ¡lez-Itier, Esteban G Contreras, Juan LarraÃ­n, ?lvaro Glavic, Fernando Faunes, Sergio GonzÃ¡lez-Itier, Esteban G Contreras, Juan LarraÃ­n, ?lvaro Glavic, Fernando Faunes"
A large family of putative transmembrane receptors homologous to the product of the Drosophila tissue polarity gene frizzled,8626800,10.1074/jbc.271.8.4468,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the frizzled gene plays an essential role in the development of tissue polarity as assessed by the orientation of cuticular structures. Through a combination of random cDNA sequencing, degenerate polymerase chain reaction amplification, and low stringency hybridization we have identified six novel frizzled homologues from mammals, at least 11 from zebrafish, several from chicken and sea urchin, and one from Caenorhabditis elegans. The complete deduced amino acid sequences of the mammalian and nematode homologues share with the Drosophila frizzled protein a conserved amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain and seven putative transmembrane segments. Each of the mammalian homologues is expressed in a distinctive set of tissues in the adult, and at least three are expressed during embryogenesis. As hypothesized for the Drosophila frizzled protein, the frizzled homologues are likely to act as transmembrane receptors for as yet unidentified ligands.

Metallothionein research in terrestrial invertebrates: synopsis and perspectives,8646613,10.1016/0742-8413(95)02078-0,"While most of metallothionein research during the past years has been carried out on mammals or vertebrates, only relatively few studies have been directed towards invertebrates. Even fewer investigations have focussed on terrestrial invertebrates. The best studied metallothioneins and/or metallothionein genes among terrestrial invertebrates are those from an insect species (Drosophila melanogaster), a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and some terrestrial gastropods (Helix pomatia, Arianta arbustorum). From these few examples it already appears that terrestrial invertebrate metallothioneins provide intriguing models to better understand the multiplicity of functions of these proteins and their evolution within the animal kingdom. Like in mammals, metallothioneins in terrestrial invertebrates seem to perform different functions simultaneously. This is exemplified by terrestrial gastropods, which are able to accumulate different metals in different tissues, in which metal-specific metallothionein isoforms or conformation forms are expressed, allowing these organisms to detoxify more efficiently nonessential trace elements such as cadmium, and at the same time to maintain the homeostasis of essential trace elements such as copper. A major proportion of metallothionein research in terrestrial invertebrates addresses the ecophysiological and ecotoxicological significance of these proteins with regard to the increasing risk due to chemical pollution. One promising aspect in this concern is the potential utilization of metallothioneins as biomarkers for risk assessment in terrestrial environments.",1996,"R Dallinger, R Dallinger"
The function of type IV collagen during Drosophila embryogenesis,28306099,10.1007/BF00377228,"A collagen gene (Dcg1) was characterized in Drosophila melanogaster and shown to encode a peptide related to vertebrate basement membrane type IV collagen chains. To study the function of type IV collagen during Drosophila development, we transformed flies with a partially truncated Dcg1 gene under the control of a heat-shock promotor. This construct induced synthesis of shortened pro-Î± chains which associated with normal ones and thereby caused degradation of the shortened and normal pro-Î± chains through a process called ""pro-collagen suicide"". A large proportion of embryos expressing the transgene developed a phenotype exhibiting absence or partial retraction of the germ band with defects in nerve cord condensation and dorsal closure. Together these results indicated that, during embryogenesis, type IV collagen was an essential guiding factor for cell-matrix interactions in morphogenetic events.",1996,"C Borchiellini, J Coulon, Y Le Parco, C Borchiellini, J Coulon, Y Le Parco"

Flies were artificially selected for differential sensitivity to the induction of bithorax phenocopies by ether vapor. The experiments demonstrated that increased sensitivity to ether correlated with a loss of expression of UBX in the third thoracic imaginal discs and that a significant proportion of the genetic variation for transcriptional stability can be attributed to polymorphism in the Ubx gene.",1996,"G Gibson, D S Hogness, G Gibson, D S Hogness"
Microsatellite polymorphisms in a wild population of Drosophila melanogaster,8690276,10.1017/s0016672300033760,"Highly variable DNA polymorphisms called microsatellites are rapidly becoming the marker of choice in population genetic studies. Until now, microsatellites have not been utilized for Drosophila studies. We have identified eight polymorphic microsatellite loci in Drosophila melanogaster and used them to characterize the genetic variation in a wild population from the Tyrrell's winery in Australia. Microsatellites were isolated from a partial genomic DNA library. All microsatellites consist of (AC)n repeats ranging from n = 2 to n = 24. Six loci were assigned to chromosomal location by genetic mapping, with three loci on chromosome II, one locus on chromosome III and two loci on the X chromosome. Up to four microsatellite loci were multiplexed in the same reaction. Microsatellite variation is substantially greater than allozyme variation in the Tyrrell's Drosophila population. 80% of the microsatellite loci examined are polymorphic, compared with 28% of allozymes. The mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus is 5.2 in microsatellites compared with 3.0 in allozymes. The average observed heterozygosity of polymorphic microsatellites is 47% compared with 26% for allozymes. Microsatellite variation in Drosophila melanogaster is similar to that reported for other insects.

Length variation of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and its relation to the recombination rate,8844158,,"Eleven genes distributed along the Drosophila melanogaster chromosome 2 and showing exonic tandem repeats of glutamine codons (CAG or CAA) were surveyed for length variation in a sample of four European and African populations. Only one gene was monomorphic. Eight genes were polymorphic in all populations, with a total number of alleles varying between five and 12 for 120 chromosomes. The average heterozygozity per locus and population was 0.41. Selective neutrality in length variation could not be rejected under the assumptions of the infinite allele model. Significant population subdivision was found though no geographical pattern emerged, all populations being equally different. Significant linkage disequilibrium was found in four out of seven cases where the genetic distance between loci was < 1 cM and was negligible when the distance was larger. There is evidence that these associations were established after the populations separated. An unexpected result was that variation at each locus was independent of the coefficient of exchange, although the latter ranged from zero to the relatively high value of 6.7%. This would indicate that background selection and selective hitchhiking, which are thought to affect levels of nucleotide substitution polymorphism, have no effect on trinucleotide repeat variation.",1996,"Y Michalakis, M Veuille, Y Michalakis, M Veuille"

[Homologue pairing: initiation sites and effects on crossing over and chromosome disjunction in Drosophila melanogaster],8647424,,"The role of homologue pairing and chromocentral association of chromosomes in recombination and segregation during cell division is discussed. Peculiarities of mitotic and meiotic chromosome pairing in Drosophila males and females are considered. On the basis of our own and published data, the presence and localization of sites of homologue pairing initiation in euchromatin are substantiated. The effects of transfer of initiation sites along a chromosome (exemplified by inversions) on chromosome pairing (asynapsis), crossing over (intrachromosomal, interchromosomal, and centromeric effects), and segregation are discussed. To record the effects of pairing sites on crossing over, a method of comparing crossing-over frequencies in an inverted region with those in a region of the same size and position with regard to the centromere on cytological maps was proposed. Chromosomes orient toward opposite division poles during paracentromeric heterochromatin pairing. This occurs after successful euchromatin pairing, during which the chromocentral circular structure is reorganized. If heterochromatin pairing is disrupted because of structural or locus mutations, nonexchange bivalents segregate randomly. In this case, chromosome coordination may occur due to proximal chiasmata or chromocentral associations between homologues.",1996,"V L Chubykin, V L Chubykin"
Spontaneous X chromosome MI and MII nondisjunction events in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes have different recombinational histories,8944020,10.1038/ng1296-406,"Recent studies of human oocytes have demonstrated an enrichment for distal exchanges among meiosis I (MI) nondisjunction events and for proximal exchanges among meiosis II (MII) events. Our characterization of 103 cases of spontaneous X chromosome nondisjunction in Drosophila oocytes strongly parallels these observations. The recombinational histories of MI (97/103) and MII (6/103) nondisjunctional ova were strikingly different. MI nondisjunction occurred primarily in oocytes with non-exchange X chromosomes; of the new nondisjoining exchange bivalents, most carried distal crossovers.

Microgravity effects on Drosophila melanogaster behavior and aging. Implications of the IML-2 experiment,8987567,10.1016/0168-1656(96)01407-1,"Earlier Space experiments had indicated that young male Drosophila flies exposed to microgravity showed an acceleration in aging. In a 14.5-day Space Shuttle Flight we sent 300 young male flies with the purpose of confirming these findings and to establish whether changes in the behavior of the flies were responsible for the effect in accordance with the proposal that alterations in mitochondrial metabolism may be involved in the aging response. By repeatedly video-recording, we have found a very marked increase in the locomotor activity of the fruitflies in Space. The males showed an accelerated aging response upon recovery, both in terms of physiological vitality assays (mating and negative geotaxis) and of life-span curves. The involvement of mitochondrial metabolism is also suggested by the finding of a greater decrease in mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA in the microgravity exposed flies than in ground controls. On the other hand, a parallel 1 x g centrifuge control did not show such differences in the life-span curves when compared to flies exposed to a similar centrifugation on the ground.

Duplicated proteasome subunit genes in Drosophila melanogaster encoding testes-specific isoforms,8878681,,"Using the previously cloned proteasome alpha-type subunit gene Pros28.1, we screened a Drosophila melanogaster genomic library using reduced stringency conditions to identify closely related genes.

Pros28.1A encodes a protein with 74% amino acid identity to PROS28.1, while the Pros28.1B gene product is 58% identical. The Pros28.1B gene has two introns, located in exactly analogous positions as the two introns in Pros28.1, while the Pros28.1A gene lacks introns. Northern blot analysis reveals that the two new genes are expressed only in males, during the pupal and adult stages. Tissue-specific patterns of expression were examined using transgenic flies carrying lacz-fusion reporter genes.

The Drosophila p70s6k homolog exhibits conserved regulatory elements and rapamycin sensitivity,8855259,10.1073/pnas.93.20.10791,"The protein p70s6k/p85s6k lies on a mitogen-stimulated signaling pathway and plays a key role in G1 progression of the cell cycle. Activation of this enzyme is mediated by a complex set of phosphorylation events, which has largely contributed to the difficulty in identifying the upstream kinases that mediate p70s6k activation. Genetics has proved a powerful complementary approach for such problems, providing an alternative means to identify components of signaling cascades and their functional end targets. As a first step toward implementing such an approach, we have cloned cDNAs encoding the Drosophila melanogaster p70s6k homolog (Dp70s6k). Dp70s6k is encoded by a single gene, which generates three mRNA transcripts and exhibits an overall identity of 78% in the catalytic domain with its mammalian counterpart. Importantly, this high identity extends beyond the catalytic domain to the N terminus, linker region, and the autoinhibitory domain. Furthermore, all the critical phosphorylation sites required for mammalian p70s6k activation are conserved within these same domains of Dp70s6k. Chief amongst these conserved sites are those associated with the selective rapamycin-induced p70s6k dephosphorylation and inactivation. Consistent with this observation, analysis of total S6 kinase activity in fractionated Drosophila Schneider line 2 cell extracts reveals two peaks of activity, only one of which is rapamycin sensitive. By employing a monospecific polyclonal antibody generated against Dp70s6k, we show that the cloned DP70s6k cDNA has identity with only the rapamycin sensitive peak, suggesting that this biological system would be useful in determining not only the mechanism of p70s6k activation, but also in elucidating the mechanism by which rapamycin acts to inhibit cell growth.",1996,"M J Stewart, C O Berry, F Zilberman, G Thomas, S C Kozma, M J Stewart, C O Berry, F Zilberman, G Thomas, S C Kozma"

Editing sites were identified from comparisons of the genomic DNA sequence with that of corresponding cDNAs prepared from various developmental stages. We show that only the non-edited sequence is present in wild-type fly chromosomes, and have conducted a genetic rescue experiment that suggests that the edited cDNA is expressed in a protein that partially complements a lethal 4f-rnp mutation. The extensive editing observed is predicted to significantly alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, and thus could provide a novel mechanism for the modulation of gene expression in Drosophila.

Our results may be summarized as follows. P-homologous sequences were detected in South American populations of D. willistoni. In two of them, a recently collected wild population and an old laboratory stock, the P insertion sites were located in the polytene chromosomes. Several hybridization sites were mapped in all major chromosome arms of the natural population, which was also chromosomally polymorphic; in the laboratory population, nearly devoid of inversions, hybridization sites were found to be confined to the chromocenter.

Homozygosity for a semi-lethal mutation of Drosophila melanogaster (abnormal spindle) altering this structure has the following effects: the mitotic cycle is arrested in metaphase, leading to a high frequency of polyploid cells; sex chromosome disjunction during male meiosis is severely affected, as revealed by the resulting exceptional (diplo and nullo) gametes (microscopic examination of spermiogenesis confirms this aberrant segregation); meiotic spindles of living cells are morphologically abnormal; and tubulins extracted from mutant larvae are normal in amount, electrophoretic mobility, and ability to form microtubules in vitro. The results suggest that the mutant phenotype is due to an altered structural component of the spindle other than tubulins.",1985,"P Ripoll, S Pimpinelli, M M Valdivia, J Avila, P Ripoll, S Pimpinelli, M M Valdivia, J Avila"
Mutant alleles at the locus elav in Drosophila melanogaster lead to nervous system defects. A developmental-genetic analysis,3926976,10.3109/01677068509100150,"We report a developmental and genetic analysis of the X-linked vital locus l(1)EC7 in Drosophila melanogaster. The locus maps in the salivary band region 1B4-5 to 1B8-9, a part of the X chromosome previously shown to be essential for normal neural development. Certain mutant alleles at the locus can cause embryonic lethality, indicating that the function provided by the gene is essential during embryogenesis. A developmental analysis of gynandromorphic genetic mosaics shows that: (1) the gene function is autonomously essential in the eye; (2) the gene function is essential for normal development of the optic lobes; and (3) the gene function is not necessary in most major imaginal-disc cell derivatives with the exception of the eye disc. Conclusions from the developmental analysis of a temperature sensitive allele are consistent with those from the mosaic analysis. The embryonic lethality caused by the mutant alleles and abnormalities observed in the genetic mosaics have led us to rename the locus l(1)EC7 to elav (embryonic lethal, abnormal visual system).",1985,"A R Campos, D Grossman, K White, A R Campos, D Grossman, K White"
Influence of age on mitochondrial enzyme levels in Drosophila,3037203,10.1016/0047-6374(87)90072-8,"The specific activity and the activity per fly of four mitochondrial enzymes did not change with ageing in male Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R). The enzymes assayed were rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c reductase, adenylate kinase, succinate cytochrome c reductase, and malate dehydrogenase, located in the outer membrane, inner membrane space, inner membrane and matrix, respectively. The specific activity of malate dehydrogenase showed no significant change for young and old head, thorax and abdomen. We conclude that there is no specific site for ageing damage in the mitochondrion, when the enzyme activities in this study are used as an indicator. It should be noted, however, that these enzymes represent only a small percentage of the total enzymes present in mitochondria.",1987,"H R Massie, K A Kogut, H R Massie, K A Kogut"
Detection in situ of genomic regulatory elements in Drosophila,2827169,10.1073/pnas.84.24.9123,"We have developed an approach for the in situ detection of genomic elements that regulate transcription zin Drosophila melanogaster. The approach is analogous to a powerful method of bacterial genetics, the random generation of operon fusions, that enables the isolation and characterization of genes simply by knowing or postulating their pattern of expression; it is not necessary initially to screen for mutant phenotypes. To apply this approach to Drosophila, we have used the expression of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli from the P-element promoter in germ-line transformant flies to screen for chromosomal elements that can act at a distance to stimulate expression from this apparently weak promoter. Of 49 transformed fly lines obtained, approximately 70% show some type of spatially regulated expression of the lacZ gene in embryos; many of these express lacZ specifically in the nervous system. The P-lacZ fusion gene is, therefore, an efficient tool for the recovery of elements that may regulate gene expression in Drosophila and for the generation of a wide variety of cell-type-specific markers.",1987,"C J O'Kane, W J Gehring, C J O'Kane, W J Gehring"
Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the murine hsp84 cDNA and chromosome assignment of related sequences,2445630,10.1016/0378-1119(87)90155-7,"The nucleotide (nt) sequence of mouse 84-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp) cDNA has been determined using a combination of molecular cloning and oligodeoxynucleotide priming on poly(A) + RNA. The cDNA was 2.5 kb long, not including the poly(A) tail. It contained a 5' leader of about 94 nt that was G + C-rich, and a 243-nt 3'-untranslated region that was A + T-rich in the vicinity of the polyadenylation signal. Gene hsp84 codes for an acidic polypeptide of 724 amino acid (aa) residues. Mouse Hsp84 had 81% and 63% aa homology to Drosophila melanogaster Hsp82 and yeast Hsp90, respectively. The nucleotide sequence had 74% and 59% homology to Drosophila and yeast hsp sequences, respectively, in the coding regions of these genes. This homology did not extend to the 5' - and 3'-untranslated regions. Chromosomal analysis indicated that hsp84-related sequences are on at least three different chromosomes.",1987,"S K Moore, C Kozak, E A Robinson, S J Ullrich, E Appella, S K Moore, C Kozak, E A Robinson, S J Ullrich, E Appella"
