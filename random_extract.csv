Developmental regulation of N-terminal H2B methylation in Drosophila melanogaster,22053083,10.1093/nar/gkr935,"Histone post-translational modifications play an important role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression in vivo. Extensive studies investigated the post-translational modifications of the core histones H3 and H4 or the linker histone H1. Much less is known on the regulation of H2A and H2B modifications. Here, we show that a major modification of H2B in Drosophila melanogaster is the methylation of the N-terminal proline, which increases during fly development. Experiments performed in cultured cells revealed higher levels of H2B methylation when cells are dense, regardless of their cell cycle distribution. We identified dNTMT (CG1675) as the enzyme responsible for H2B methylation. We also found that the level of N-terminal methylation is regulated by dART8, an arginine methyltransferase that physically interacts with dNTMT and asymmetrically methylates H3R2. Our results demonstrate the existence of a complex containing two methyltransferases enzymes, which negatively influence each other's activity.",2012,"Ana Villar-Garea, Ignasi Forne, Irene Vetter, Elisabeth Kremmer, Andreas Thomae, Axel Imhof, Ana Villar-Garea, Ignasi Forne, Irene Vetter, Elisabeth Kremmer, Andreas Thomae, Axel Imhof"
Courtship song analysis of Drosophila muscle mutants,21945578,10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.09.007,"As part of the mating ritual, males of Drosophila species produce species-specific courtship songs through wing vibrations generated by the thoracic musculature. While previous studies have shown that indirect flight muscles (IFM) are neurally activated during courtship song production, the precise role of these muscles in song production has not been investigated. Fortunately, IFM mutants abound in Drosophila melanogaster and studies spanning several decades have shed light on the role of muscle proteins in IFM-powered flight. Analysis of courtship songs in these mutants offers the opportunity to uncover the role of the IFM in a behavior distinct than flight and subject to different evolutionary selection regimes. Here, we describe protocols for the recording and analysis of courtship behavior and mating song of D. melanogaster muscle transgenic and mutant strains. To record faint acoustic signal of courtship songs, an insulated mating compartment was used inside a recording device (INSECTAVOX) equipped with a modified electret microphone, a low-noise power supply, and noise filters. Songs recorded in the INSECTAVOX are digitized using Goldwave, whose several features enable extraction of critical song parameters, including carrier frequencies for pulse song and sine song. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that deletion of the N-terminal region of the myosin regulatory light chain, a mutation known to decrease wing beat frequency and flight power, affects courtship song parameters.",2012,"Samya Chakravorty, Mathew P Wajda, Jim O Vigoreaux, Samya Chakravorty, Mathew P Wajda, Jim O Vigoreaux"
Sexual selection is ineffectual or inhibits the purging of deleterious mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,22759290,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01584.x,"The effects of sexual selection on population mean fitness are unclear and a subject of debate. Recent models propose that, because reproductive success may be condition dependent, much of the genome may be a target of sexual selection. Under this scenario, mutations that reduce health, and thus nonsexual fitness, may also be deleterious with respect to reproductive success, meaning that sexual selection may contribute to the purging of deleterious alleles. We tested this hypothesis directly by subjecting replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations to two treatments that altered the opportunity for sexual selection and then tracked changes in the frequency of six separate deleterious alleles with recessive and visible phenotypic effects. While natural selection acted to decrease the frequency of all six mutations, the addition of sexual selection did not aid in the purging of any of them, and for three of them appears to have hampered it. Courtship and mating have harmful effects in this species and mate choice assays showed that males directed more courtship and mating behavior toward wild-type over mutant females, providing a likely explanation for sexual selection's cost. Whether this cost extends to other mutations (e.g., those lacking visible phenotypic effects) is an important topic for future research.",2012,"Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle, Devin Arbuthnott, Howard D Rundle"
Mechanism and function of Drosophila capa GPCR: a desiccation stress-responsive receptor with functional homology to human neuromedinU receptor,22253819,10.1371/journal.pone.0029897,"The capa peptide receptor, capaR (CG14575), is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the D. melanogaster capa neuropeptides, Drm-capa-1 and -2 (capa-1 and -2). To date, the capa peptide family constitutes the only known nitridergic peptides in insects, so the mechanisms and physiological function of ligand-receptor signalling of this peptide family are of interest. Capa peptide induces calcium signaling via capaR with EC?â? values for capa-1 = 3.06 nM and capa-2 = 4.32 nM. capaR undergoes rapid desensitization, with internalization via a b-arrestin-2 mediated mechanism but is rapidly re-sensitized in the absence of capa-1. Drosophila capa peptides have a C-terminal -FPRXamide motif and insect-PRXamide peptides are evolutionarily related to vertebrate peptide neuromedinU (NMU). Potential agonist effects of human NMU-25 and the insect -PRLamides [Drosophila pyrokinins Drm-PK-1 (capa-3), Drm-PK-2 and hugin-gamma [hugg]] against capaR were investigated. NMU-25, but not hugg nor Drm-PK-2, increases intracellular calcium ([CaÂ²?º]i) levels via capaR. In vivo, NMU-25 increases [CaÂ²?º]i and fluid transport by the Drosophila Malpighian (renal) tubule. Ectopic expression of human NMU receptor 2 in tubules of transgenic flies results in increased [CaÂ²?º]i and fluid transport. Finally, anti-porcine NMU-8 staining of larval CNS shows that the most highly immunoreactive cells are capa-producing neurons. These structural and functional data suggest that vertebrate NMU is a putative functional homolog of Drm-capa-1 and -2. capaR is almost exclusively expressed in tubule principal cells; cell-specific targeted capaR RNAi significantly reduces capa-1 stimulated [CaÂ²?º]i and fluid transport. Adult capaR RNAi transgenic flies also display resistance to desiccation. Thus, capaR acts in the key fluid-transporting tissue to regulate responses to desiccation stress in the fly.",2012,"Selim Terhzaz, Pablo Cabrero, Joris H Robben, Jonathan C Radford, Brian D Hudson, Graeme Milligan, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies, Selim Terhzaz, Pablo Cabrero, Joris H Robben, Jonathan C Radford, Brian D Hudson, Graeme Milligan, Julian A T Dow, Shireen-A Davies"
Fast PCA for processing calcium-imaging data from the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,22595087,10.1186/1472-6947-12-S1-S2,"Background:
      
    

    
      The calcium-imaging technique allows us to record movies of brain activity in the antennal lobe of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, a brain compartment dedicated to information about odors. Signal processing, e.g. with source separation techniques, can be slow on the large movie datasets.
    

    
  


        Method:
      
    

    
      We have developed an approximate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for fast dimensionality reduction. The method samples relevant pixels from the movies, such that PCA can be performed on a smaller matrix. Utilising a priori knowledge about the nature of the data, we minimise the risk of missing important pixels.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Our method allows for fast approximate computation of PCA with adaptive resolution and running time. Utilising a priori knowledge about the data enables us to concentrate more biological signals in a small pixel sample than a general sampling method based on vector norms.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Fast dimensionality reduction with approximate PCA removes a computational bottleneck and leads to running time improvements for subsequent algorithms. Once in PCA space, we can efficiently perform source separation, e.g to detect biological signals in the movies or to remove artifacts.",2012,"Martin Strauch, C Giovanni Galizia, Martin Strauch, C Giovanni Galizia"
Epithelial cell polarity: what flies can teach us about cancer,22928513,10.1042/bse0530129,"Epithelial cells are polarized along their apical-basal axis. Much of the cellular machinery that goes into establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity is evolutionarily conserved. Model organisms, including the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, are thus particularly useful for the study of cell polarity. Work in Drosophila has identified several important components of the polarity machinery and has also established the surprising existence of a secondary cell polarity pathway required only under conditions of energetic stress. This work has important implications for the understanding of human cancer. Most cancers are epithelial in origin, and the loss of cell polarity is a critical step towards malignancy. Thus a better understanding of how polarity is established and maintained in epithelial cells will help us to understand the process of malignant transformation and may lead to improved therapies. In the present chapter we discuss the current understanding of how epithelial cell polarity is regulated and the known associations between polarity factors and cancer.",2012,"Daniel T Bergstralh, Daniel St Johnston, Daniel T Bergstralh, Daniel St Johnston"
Developmental expression of drop-dead is required for early adult survival and normal body mass in Drosophila melanogaster,22728457,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.06.002,"In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the gene drop-dead (drd) result in early adult lethality, with flies dying within 2 weeks of eclosion. Additional phenotypes include neurodegeneration, tracheal defects, starvation, reduced body mass, and female sterility. The cause of early lethality and the function of the drd protein remain unknown. In the current study, the temporal profiles of drd expression required for adult survival and body mass regulation were investigated. Knockdown of drd expression by UAS-RNAi transgenes and rescue of drd expression on a drd mutant background by a UAS-drd transgene were controlled with the Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70)-Gal4 driver. Flies were heat-shocked at different stages of their lifecycle, and the survival and body mass of the resulting adult flies were assayed. Surprisingly, the adult lethal phenotype did not depend upon drd expression in the adult. Rather, expression of drd during the second half of metamorphosis was both necessary and sufficient to prevent rapid adult mortality. In contrast, the attainment of normal adult body mass required a different temporal pattern of drd expression. In this case, manipulation of drd expression solely during larval development or metamorphosis had no effect on body mass, while knockdown or rescue of drd expression during all of pre-adult (embryonic, larval, and pupal) development did significantly alter body mass. Together, these results indicate that the adult-lethal gene drd is required only during development. Furthermore, the mutant phenotypes of body mass and lifespan are separable phenotypes arising from an absence of drd expression at different developmental stages.",2012,"Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal, Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal"
"Drosophila CK1-Î³, gilgamesh, controls PCP-mediated morphogenesis through regulation of vesicle trafficking",22391037,10.1083/jcb.201107137,"Cellular morphogenesis, including polarized outgrowth, promotes tissue shape and function. Polarized vesicle trafficking has emerged as a fundamental mechanism by which protein and membrane can be targeted to discrete subcellular domains to promote localized protrusions. Frizzled (Fz)/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling orchestrates cytoskeletal polarization and drives morphogenetic changes in such contexts as the vertebrate body axis and external Drosophila melanogaster tissues. Although regulation of Fz/PCP signaling via vesicle trafficking has been identified, the interplay between the vesicle trafficking machinery and downstream terminal PCP-directed processes is less established. In this paper, we show that Drosophila CK1-Î³/gilgamesh (gish) regulates the PCP-associated process of trichome formation through effects on Rab11-mediated vesicle recycling. Although the core Fz/PCP proteins dictate prehair formation broadly, CK1-Î³/gish restricts nucleation to a single site. Moreover, CK1-Î³/gish works in parallel with the Fz/PCP effector multiple wing hairs, which restricts prehair formation along the perpendicular axis to Gish. Our findings suggest that polarized Rab11-mediated vesicle trafficking regulated by CK1-Î³ is required for PCP-directed processes.",2012,"William J Gault, Patricio Olguin, Ursula Weber, Marek Mlodzik, William J Gault, Patricio Olguin, Ursula Weber, Marek Mlodzik"
Downregulation of hsp22 gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster from sites located near chemical plants,22576832,10.4238/2012.March.22.4,"A common physiological response of organisms to environmental conditions is variation in gene expression, especially true for genes encoding for heat shock proteins. In insects, this process has been examined for induced heat or cold stress. The putative long-term imprinted/acquired heat shock protein response due to unfriendly environmental conditions has been far less studied. The Drosophila melanogaster hsp22 gene, which has been extensively reviewed as being sensitive to different changing life conditions, was examined by qRT-PCR, using carboxy-X-rhodamine. In the present study, we focused on the detection of hsp22 level of transcription in three D. melanogaster isolates, collected from sites located near different chemical plants in Romania and subjected to one-year adaptation to laboratory conditions. In all isolates, the hsp22 gene expression was determined using the housekeeping genes Gapdh1 and UbcD10 as internal controls. According to our experimental results, the D. melanogaster hsp22 gene was significantly downregulated compared to the same gene in w(1118)iso, used as a calibrator. We showed that hsp22 could play an important role in relation to stress resistance and adaptation.

We investigated male and female mate preferences with respect to relatedness in the fruit fly D. melanogaster. Experiments offered the choice between a first order relative (full-sibling or parent) and an unrelated individual with the same age and mating history. We found that females significantly preferred mating with their brothers, thus supporting inbreeding preference. Moreover, females did not avoid mating with their fathers, and males did not avoid mating with their sisters, thus supporting inbreeding tolerance. Our experiments therefore add empirical evidence for inbreeding preference, which strengthens the prediction that inbreeding tolerance and preference can evolve under specific circumstances through the positive effects on inclusive fitness.",2012,"Adeline Loyau, JÃ©rÃ©mie H Cornuau, Jean Clobert, Etienne Danchin, Adeline Loyau, JÃ©rÃ©mie H Cornuau, Jean Clobert, Etienne Danchin"
fussel (fuss)--A negative regulator of BMP signaling in Drosophila melanogaster,22879948,10.1371/journal.pone.0042349,"The TGF-Î²/BMP signaling cascades control a wide range of developmental and physiological functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. In Drosophila melanogaster, members of this pathway can be divided into a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) and an Activin-? (Act-?) branch, where Decapentaplegic (Dpp), a member of the BMP family has been most intensively studied. They differ in ligands, receptors and transmitting proteins, but also share some components, such as the Co-Smad Medea (Med). The essential role of Med is to form a complex with one of the two activating Smads, mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad) or dSmad, and to translocate together to the nucleus where they can function as transcriptional regulators of downstream target genes. This signaling cascade underlies different mechanisms of negative regulation, which can be exerted by inhibitory Smads, such as daughters against decapentaplegic (dad), but also by the Ski-Sno family. In this work we identified and functionally analyzed a new member of the Ski/Sno-family, fussel (fuss), the Drosophila homolog of the human functional suppressing element 15 (fussel-15). fuss codes for two differentially spliced transcripts with a neuronal expression pattern. The proteins are characterized by a Ski-Sno and a SAND homology domain. Overexpression studies and genetic interaction experiments clearly reveal an interaction of fuss with members of the BMP pathway, leading to a strong repression of BMP-signaling. The protein interacts directly with Medea and seems to reprogram the Smad pathway through its influence upon the formation of functional Mad/Medea complexes. This leads amongst others to a repression of downstream target genes of the Dpp pathway, such as optomotor blind (omb).

Regulation of cyclin A localization downstream of Par-1 function is critical for the centrosome orientation checkpoint in Drosophila male germline stem cells,22024320,10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.10.010,"Male germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila melanogaster divide asymmetrically by orienting the mitotic spindle with respect to the niche, a microenvironment that specifies stem cell identity. The spindle orientation is prepared during interphase through stereotypical positioning of the centrosomes. We recently demonstrated that GSCs possess a checkpoint (""the centrosome orientation checkpoint"") that monitors correct centrosome orientation prior to mitosis to ensure an oriented spindle and thus asymmetric outcome of the division. Here, we show that Par-1, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates polarity in many systems, is involved in this checkpoint. Par-1 shows a cell cycle-dependent localization to the spectrosome, a germline-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-like organelle. Furthermore, the localization of cyclin A, which is normally localized to the spectrosome, is perturbed in par-1 mutant GSCs. Interestingly, overexpression of mutant cyclin A that does not localize to the spectrosome and mutation in hts, a core component of the spectrosome, both lead to defects in the centrosome orientation checkpoint. We propose that the regulation of cyclin A localization via Par-1 function plays a critical role in the centrosome orientation checkpoint.",2012,"Hebao Yuan, C-Y Ason Chiang, Jun Cheng, Viktoria Salzmann, Yukiko M Yamashita, Hebao Yuan, C-Y Ason Chiang, Jun Cheng, Viktoria Salzmann, Yukiko M Yamashita"
Stability of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster under semi-natural condition,23209729,10.1371/journal.pone.0050379,"Here we report the results of a study aimed at examining stability of adult emergence and activity/rest rhythms under semi-natural conditions (henceforth SN), in four large outbred fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster populations, selected for emergence in a narrow window of time under laboratory (henceforth LAB) light/dark (LD) cycles. When assessed under LAB, selected flies display enhanced stability in terms of higher amplitude, synchrony and accuracy in emergence and activity rhythms compared to controls. The present study was conducted to assess whether such differences in stability between selected and control populations, persist under SN where several gradually changing time-cues are present in their strongest form. The study revealed that under SN, emergence waveform of selected flies was modified, with even more enhanced peak and narrower gate-width compared to those observed in the LAB and compared to control populations in SN. Furthermore, flies from selected populations continued to exhibit enhanced synchrony and accuracy in their emergence and activity rhythms under SN compared to controls. Further analysis of zeitgeber effects revealed that enhanced stability in the rhythmicity of selected flies under SN was primarily due to increased sensitivity to light because emergence and activity rhythms of selected flies were as stable as controls under temperature cycles. These results thus suggest that stability of circadian rhythms in fruit flies D. melanogaster, which evolved as a consequence of selection for emergence in a narrow window of time under weak zeitgeber condition of LAB, persists robustly in the face of day-to-day variations in cycling environmental factors of nature.",2012,"Nisha N Kannan, Vishwanath Varma, Joydeep De, Vijay Kumar Sharma, Nisha N Kannan, Vishwanath Varma, Joydeep De, Vijay Kumar Sharma"
Evolution of gene expression and expression plasticity in long-term experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained under constant and variable ethanol stress,22774776,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2012.05697.x,"Gene expression responds to the environment and can also evolve rapidly in response to altered selection regimes. Little is known, however, about the extent to which evolutionary adaptation to a particular type of stress involves changes in the within-generation ('plastic') responses of gene expression to the stress. We used microarrays to quantify gene expression plasticity in response to ethanol in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster differing in their history of ethanol exposure. Two populations ('R' populations) were maintained on regular medium, two ('E') were maintained on medium supplemented with ethanol, and two ('M') were maintained in a mixed regime in which half of the population was reared on one medium type, and half on the other, each generation. After more than 300 generations, embryos from each population were collected and exposed to either ethanol or water as a control, and RNA was extracted from the larvae shortly after hatching. Nearly 2000 transcripts showed significant within-generation responses to ethanol exposure. Evolutionary history also affected gene expression: the E and M populations were largely indistinguishable in expression, but differed significantly in expression from the R populations for over 100 transcripts, the majority of which did not show plastic responses. Notably, in no case was the interaction between selection regime and ethanol exposure significant after controlling for multiple comparisons, indicating that adaptation to ethanol in the E and M populations did not involve substantial changes in gene expression plasticity.

However, the gustatory information of a sugar may be misleading as some sugars, although perceived as ""sweet,"" cannot be metabolized. Accordingly, in adult Drosophila, a postingestive system that additionally evaluates the nutritional benefit of an ingested sugar has been shown to exist. By using a set of seven different sugars, which either offer (fructose, sucrose, glucose, maltodextrin, and sorbitol) or lack (xylose and arabinose) nutritional benefit, we show that Drosophila, at the larval stage, can perceive and evaluate sugars based on both nutrition-dependent and -independent qualities. In detail, we find that larval survival and feeding mainly depend on the nutritional value of a particular sugar.

The responses of the NADP-reducing enzymes and two downstream phenotypes (lipid and glycogen concentration) were compared between the control and stress conditions. In general, responses in NADP-reducing enzymes were greater under conditions of oxidative stress, likely due to an increased demand for NADPH. Interactions between the enzymes were altered by environmental stress in directions and magnitudes that are consistent with differential contributions of the different enzymes to the NADPH pool: the contributions of G6PD and IDH seem to be accentuated by oxidative stress, and MEN by starvation.

Previous studies employing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based live-cell imaging demonstrated that these transport carriers are pleiomorphic structures composed of tubular and vesicular elements. Introducing a time-axis into light microscopic observations enabled us to identify transport carriers that are derived from or targeted at a distinct organelle. In this study, we describe several methods for the observation of GFP-tagged MPRs. Photobleaching the peripheral region of a cell before a time-lapse observation allows us to monitor TGN-derived transport carriers for longer periods (more than 4min). Events of their targeting into endosomes can be visualized by dual-color imaging of both GFP-MPRs and fluorescently tagged transferrin that is internalized by cells. By using a technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we can analyze overall cycling kinetics of MPRs in a single cell. Transport of MPRs is regulated by several cytosolic factors like clathrin adaptors, AP1, and GGAs. The adaptors on the TGN membranes are exchanging with their cytosolic pool, which can also be analyzed by FRAP. In addition, the relationships of the MPR-containing transport carriers that left the TGN and the adaptors can be visualized by dual-color imaging. A similar system of membrane transport and its regulation is well documented in drosophila cells. As Drosophila melanogaster has only a single MPR (LERP), AP1, or GGA, it is an ideal model system for the understanding of specific functions of each cytosolic factor. To visualize these molecules in drosophila cells, however, we need to consider that multiple Golgi dots exist scattered in the cytoplasm. Thus, the Golgi dots or endosomes should be identified before live-cell imaging.",2012,"Satoshi Kametaka, Satoshi Waguri, Satoshi Kametaka, Satoshi Waguri"
"Insulin-Producing Cells in the Drosophila Brain also Express Satiety-Inducing Cholecystokinin-Like Peptide, Drosulfakinin",22969751,10.3389/fendo.2012.00109,"Regulation of meal size and assessing the nutritional value of food are two important aspects of feeding behavior. The mechanisms that regulate these two aspects have not been fully elucidated in Drosophila. Diminished signaling with insulin-like peptides Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) affects food intake in flies, but it is not clear what signal(s) mediates satiety. Here we investigate the role of DILPs and drosulfakinins (DSKs), cholecystokinin-like peptides, as satiety signals in Drosophila. We show that DSKs and DILPs are co-expressed in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) of the brain. Next we analyzed the effects of diminishing DSKs or DILPs employing the Gal4-UAS system by (1) diminishing DSK-levels without directly affecting DILP levels by targeted Dsk-RNAi, either in all DSK-producing cells (DPCs) or only in the IPCs or (2) expressing a hyperpolarizing potassium channel to inactivate either all the DPCs or only the IPCs, affecting release of both peptides. The transgenic flies were assayed for feeding and food choice, resistance to starvation, and for levels of Dilp and Dsk transcripts in brains of fed and starved animals. Diminishment of DSK in the IPCs alone is sufficient to cause defective regulation of food intake and food choice, indicating that DSK functions as a hormonal satiety signal in Drosophila. Quantification of Dsk and Dilp transcript levels reveals that knockdown of either peptide type affects the transcript levels of the other, suggesting a possible feedback regulation between the two signaling pathways. In summary, DSK and DILPs released from the IPCs regulate feeding, food choice and metabolic homeostasis in Drosophila in a coordinated fashion.",2012,"Jeannette A E SÃ¶derberg, Mikael A Carlsson, Dick R NÃ¤ssel, Jeannette A E SÃ¶derberg, Mikael A Carlsson, Dick R NÃ¤ssel"
Integrating body and organ size in Drosophila: recent advances and outstanding problems,22654869,10.3389/fendo.2012.00049,"OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, FUNDAMENTAL STRIDES IN PHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS HAVE ALLOWED US TO FINALLY GRASP THE DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISMS REGULATING BODY SIZE, PRIMARILY IN ONE MODEL ORGANISM: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, as in all animals, final body size is regulated by the rate and duration of growth. These studies have identified important roles for the insulin and the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways in regulating the growth rate of the larva, the stage most important in determining final adult size. Furthermore, they have shown that the insulin/TOR pathway interacts with hormonal systems, like ecdysone and juvenile hormone, to regulate the timing of development and hence the duration of growth. This interaction allows the growing larvae to integrate cues from the environment with environmentally sensitive developmental windows to ensure that optimal size and proportions are reached given the larval rearing conditions. Results from this work have opened up new avenues of studies, including how environmental cues are integrated to regulate developmental time and how organs maintain proportional growth. Other researchers interested in the evolution of body size are beginning to apply these results to studies of body size evolution and the generation of allometry. With these new findings, and with the developments to come, the field of size control finds itself in the fortunate position of finally being able to tackle century old questions of how organisms achieve final adult size and proportions. This review discusses the state of the art of size control from a Drosophila perspective, and outlines an approach to resolving outstanding issues.",2012,"Christen Kerry Mirth, Alexander W Shingleton, Christen Kerry Mirth, Alexander W Shingleton"

Here the authors test if the starvation-induced increase of feeding motivation is different among wild-derived strains of Drosophila melanogaster. In behavioral experiments comparing the feeding behaviors of the strains Mel6 and TW1, only TW1 exhibited a decreased feeding threshold to sucrose following a 24-h starvation period. Starved TW1 preferably ingested a low concentration of sucrose. Starved TW1 also exhibited significant elevation of taste responsiveness to low concentrations of sucrose and enhanced expression of the Gr64a sucrose sugar receptor gene. TW1 survived longer than Mel6 when provided a less nutritious food (10 mM sucrose). Thus, the starvation-induced decrease in the behavioral and the sensory thresholds could be an advantage in searching for and utilizing less nutritious foods.

Directional cues in Drosophila melanogaster audition: structure of acoustic flow and inter-antennal velocity differences,22723479,10.1242/jeb.068940,"Drosophila melanogaster have bilateral antisymmetric antennae that receive the particle velocity component of an acoustic stimulus. Acoustic communication is important in their courtship, which takes place in the acoustic near-field. Here, the small size of the dipole sound source (the male wing) and the rapid attenuation rate of particle velocity produce a spatially divergent sound field with highly variable magnitude. Also, male and female D. melanogaster are not usually stationary during courtship, resulting in a variable directionality of the acoustic stimulus. Using both particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler vibrometry, we examined the stimulus flow around the head of D. melanogaster to identify the actual geometry of the acoustic input to the antennae and its directional response. We reveal that the stimulus changes in both magnitude and direction as a function of its angle of incidence. Remarkably, directionality is substantial, with inter-antennal velocity differences of 25 dB at 140 Hz. For an organism whose auditory receivers are separated by only 660 Â± 51 Î¼m (mean Â± s.d.), this inter-antennal velocity difference is far greater than differences in intensity observed between tympanal ears for organisms of similar scale. Further, the mechanical sensitivity of the antennae changes as a function of the angle of incidence of the acoustic stimulus, with peak responses along axes at 45 and 315 deg relative to the longitudinal body axis. This work indicates not only that the flies are able to detect differential cues in signal direction, but also that the male song structure may not be the sole determinant of mating success; his spatial positioning is also crucial to female sound reception and therefore also perhaps to her decision making.",2012,"Erica L Morley, Thomas Steinmann, JÃ©rÃ´me Casas, Daniel Robert, Erica L Morley, Thomas Steinmann, JÃ©rÃ´me Casas, Daniel Robert"
Large ventral lateral neurons determine the phase of evening activity peak across photoperiods in Drosophila melanogaster,22855571,10.1177/0748730412449820,"The dual-oscillator model, originally proposed as a mechanism for how vertebrates adapt to seasonal changes, has been invoked to explain circadian entrainment in Drosophila melanogaster. Distinct subsets of neurons have been designated as ""morning"" and ""evening"" oscillators that function as regulators of rhythmic activity/rest behavior. Some studies have led to a model in which a subset of 8 ""morning"" cells (4 bilaterally located small ventral lateral neurons) and another subset of approximately 130 ""evening"" cells exert different levels of dominance within the circadian circuit in different seasons. However, many studies propose a more integrative neuronal network, with the whole network orchestrating activity/rest rhythms in different seasons, as opposed to hierarchical dominance among neurons. Within the circadian network, our understanding of the role of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-LN(v)) has thus far been limited to conveying light information to the clocks and as light-activated neurons mediating arousal. In support of the framework of a more distributed model, we report an important circadian clock-related role for the l-LN(v) in electrical activity-dependent phasing of the evening peak across a range of photoperiods. Further, we propose a model in which l-LN(v) enable adaptation to seasonal changes by regulating the phase of the evening peak. Additionally, we demonstrate a hitherto unknown role for the small ventral lateral neurons (s-LN(v)) in the arousal circuit, thus showing that neuronal function is flexible such that certain neurons can play more than one role in distinct circuits.",2012,"Sheetal Potdar, Vasu Sheeba, Sheetal Potdar, Vasu Sheeba"

N-cadherin was expressed in founder cells and fusion-competent myoblasts of Drosophila during the first fusion phase. Our genetic analyses demonstrated that the myoblast fusion defect of schizo/loner mutants is rescued in part by the loss-of-function mutation of N-cadherin, which suggests that Schizo/Loner is a negative regulator of N-cadherin. Based on our findings, we propose a model where N-cadherin must be removed from the myoblast membrane to induce a protein-free zone at the cell-cell contact point to permit fusion.",2012,"Christine Dottermusch-Heidel, Verena Groth, Lothar Beck, Susanne-Filiz ?nel, Christine Dottermusch-Heidel, Verena Groth, Lothar Beck, Susanne-Filiz ?nel"
"A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3",22728672,10.4161/fly.19695,"We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating ~356,660 candidate SNPs in ~117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of ~1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that ~15,842 SNPs are synonymous and ~4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S ~0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3' UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus.

Genetic analysis of mitochondrial protein misfolding in Drosophila melanogaster,22301916,10.1038/cdd.2012.5,"Protein misfolding has a key role in several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease. Although a clear mechanism for such proteinopathic diseases is well established when aggregated proteins accumulate in the cytosol, cell nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular space, little is known about the role of protein aggregation in the mitochondria. Here we show that mutations in both human and fly PINK1 result in higher levels of misfolded components of respiratory complexes and increase in markers of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Through the development of a genetic model of mitochondrial protein misfolding employing Drosophila melanogaster, we show that the in vivo accumulation of an unfolded protein in mitochondria results in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase-dependent autophagy and phenocopies of pink1 and parkin mutants. Parkin expression acts to clear mitochondria with enhanced levels of misfolded proteins by promoting their autophagic degradation in vivo, and refractory to Sigma P (ref(2)P), the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian p62, is a critical downstream effector of this quality control pathway. We show that in flies, a pathway involving pink1, parkin and ref(2)P has a role in the maintenance of a viable pool of cellular mitochondria by promoting organellar quality control.",2012,"I Pimenta de Castro, A C Costa, D Lam, R Tufi, V Fedele, N Moisoi, D Dinsdale, E Deas, S H Y Loh, L M Martins, I Pimenta de Castro, A C Costa, D Lam, R Tufi, V Fedele, N Moisoi, D Dinsdale, E Deas, S H Y Loh, L M Martins"
Whole Genome Sequencing and a New Bioinformatics Platform Allow for Rapid Gene Identification in D. melanogaster EMS Screens,24832518,10.3390/biology1030766,"Forward genetic screens in Drosophila melanogaster using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis are a powerful approach for identifying genes that modulate specific biological processes in an in vivo setting. The mapping of genes that contain randomly-induced point mutations has become more efficient in Drosophila thanks to the maturation and availability of many types of genetic tools. However, classic approaches to gene mapping are relatively slow and ultimately require extensive Sanger sequencing of candidate chromosomal loci. With the advent of new high-throughput sequencing techniques, it is increasingly efficient to directly re-sequence the whole genome of model organisms. This approach, in combination with traditional chromosomal mapping, has the potential to greatly simplify and accelerate mutation identification in mutants generated in EMS screens. Here we show that next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an accurate and efficient tool for high-throughput sequencing and mutation discovery in Drosophila melanogaster. As a test case, mutant strains of Drosophila that exhibited long-term survival of severed peripheral axons were identified in a forward EMS mutagenesis. All mutants were recessive and fell into a single lethal complementation group, which suggested that a single gene was responsible for the protective axon degenerative phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of these genomes identified the underlying gene ect4. To improve the process of genome wide mutation identification, we developed Genomes Management Application (GEM.app, https://genomics.med.miami.edu), a graphical online user interface to a custom query framework. Using a custom GEM.app query, we were able to identify that each mutant carried a unique non-sense mutation in the gene ect4 (dSarm), which was recently shown by Osterloh et al. to be essential for the activation of axonal degeneration. Our results demonstrate the current advantages and limitations of NGS in Drosophila and we introduce GEM.app as a simple yet powerful genomics analysis tool for the Drosophila community.

Many of these genes do, however, regulate segmentation in arthropods and do so with dual-segment periodicity. Here we examine the expression and function of honeybee orthologues of Drosophila pair-rule genes. Knockdown of the expression of these genes leads to extensive patterning defects, implying that they act in early patterning, as well as segmentation in honeybee embryos.

      Here, we present the new version of PathWave with several substantial improvements including a new method for optimally mapping pathway networks unto compact 2D lattice grids, a more flexible and user-friendly interface, and pre-arranged 2D grid representations. These pathway representations are assembled for several species now comprising H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, C. elegans, and E. coli.

Unlike other organisms, Drosophila only have one known DNA methyltransferase, DNMT2, which is expressed in the ovaries and historically has been thought to be responsible for limited genomic DNA methylation.

We are investigating a process similar to Position Effect Variegation (PEV) using a mini-w transgene, called Pci, inserted in the upstream regulatory region of ci. The mini-white+ transgene in Pci is expressed throughout the adult eye; however, when other P or KP elements are present, a variegated eye phenotype results indicating random w+ silencing during development. This P element dependent silencing (PDS) can be modified by the haplo-suppressors/triplo-enhancers, Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-7, indicating that these heterochromatic modifiers also act dose dependently in PDS. Here we use a spontaneous derivative mutation of Pci called PciE1 (E1) that variegates like PDS in the absence of P elements, presumably due to an adjacent gypsy element insertion, to screen for second-site modifier mutations that enhance variable silencing of white+ in E1. We isolated 7 mutations in CG8878, an essential gene, that enhance the E1 variegated phenotype. CG8878, a previously uncharacterized gene, potentially encodes a serine/threonine kinase whose closest Drosophila paralogue, ballchen (nhk-1), phosphorylates histones. These mutant alleles enhance both PDS at E1 and Position Effect Variegation (PEV) at w(m4), indicating a previously unknown common silencing mechanism between the two.",2014,"Allen McCracken, John Locke, Allen McCracken, John Locke"
"Inhibitory and toxic effects of volatiles emitted by strains of Pseudomonas and Serratia on growth and survival of selected microorganisms, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster",25006575,10.1155/2014/125704,"In previous research, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by various bacteria into the chemosphere were suggested to play a significant role in the antagonistic interactions between microorganisms occupying the same ecological niche and between bacteria and target eukaryotes. Moreover, a number of volatiles released by bacteria were reported to suppress quorum-sensing cell-to-cell communication in bacteria, and to stimulate plant growth. Here, volatiles produced by Pseudomonas and Serratia strains isolated mainly from the soil or rhizosphere exhibited bacteriostatic action on phytopathogenic Agrobacterium tumefaciens and fungi and demonstrated a killing effect on cyanobacteria, flies (Drosophila melanogaster), and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans). VOCs emitted by the rhizospheric Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 449 and by Serratia proteamaculans strain 94 isolated from spoiled meat were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, and the effects of the main headspace compounds--ketones (2-nonanone, 2-heptanone, 2-undecanone) and dimethyl disulfide--were inhibitory toward the tested microorganisms, nematodes, and flies.

High-NaCl perception in Drosophila melanogaster,25122890,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4795-13.2014,"Salt is a fundamental nutrient that is required for many physiological processes, including electrolyte homeostasis and neuronal activity. In mammals and Drosophila, the detection of NaCl induces two different behaviors: low-salt concentrations provide an attractive stimulus, whereas high-salt concentrations are avoided. We identified the gene called serrano (sano) as being expressed in the sensory organs of Drosophila larvae. A transgenic reporter line showed that sano was coexpressed with Gr66a in a subset of gustatory neurons in the terminal organ of third-instar larvae. The disruption of sano gene expression in gustatory neurons led to the specific loss of high-salt concentration avoidance in larvae, whereas the detection of other attractive or aversive substances was unaffected. Moreover, using a cellular marker sensitive to calcium levels, Sano function was shown to be required for neuronal activity in response to high-salt concentrations. In these neurons, the loss of the DEG/ENaC channel PPK19 function also eliminated the cellular response to high-salt concentrations. Our study revealed that PPK19 and Sano are required in the neurons of the larval gustatory organs for the detection of high-salt concentrations.",2014,"Georges Alves, JÃ©rÃ©my SallÃ©, Sylvie Chaudy, StÃ©phane Dupas, GÃ©rard ManiÃ¨re, Georges Alves, JÃ©rÃ©my SallÃ©, Sylvie Chaudy, StÃ©phane Dupas, GÃ©rard ManiÃ¨re"
Temporal integration of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs in isolated insect mushroom body neurons exposes pairing-specific signal processing,25429149,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0714-14.2014,"GABAergic modulation of neuronal activity plays a crucial role in physiological processes including learning and memory in both insects and mammals. During olfactory learning in honeybees (Apis mellifera) and Drosophila melanogaster the temporal relation between excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs critically affects learning. However, the cellular mechanisms of temporal integration of these antagonistic inputs are unknown. To address this question, we use calcium imaging of isolated honeybee and Drosophila Kenyon cells (KCs), which are targets of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs during olfactory learning. In the whole population of honeybee KCs we find that pairing of acetylcholine (ACh) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Comment: Please use the greek letter for gamma reduces the ACh-induced calcium influx, and depending on their temporal sequence, induces different forms of neuronal plasticity. After ACh-GABA pairing the calcium influx of a subsequent excitatory stimulus is increased, while GABA-ACh pairing affects the decay time leading to elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. In an exactly defined subset of Drosophila KCs implicated in learning we find similar pairing-specific differences. Specifically the GABA-ACh pairing splits the KCs in two functional subgroups: one is only weakly inhibited by GABA and shows no neuronal plasticity and the other subgroup is strongly inhibited by GABA and shows elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. Our findings provide evidence that insect KCs are capable of contributing to temporal processing of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs, which provides a neuronal mechanism of the differential temporal role of GABAergic inhibition during learning.",2014,"Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller, Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller"
Brain Proteome Changes Induced by Olfactory Learning in Drosophila,24983411,10.1021/pr500325q,"For more than 30 years, the study of learning and memory in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) has used an olfactory learning paradigm and has resulted in the discovery of many genes involved in memory formation. By varying learning programs, the creation of different memory types can be achieved, from short-term memory formation to long-term. Previous studies in the fruit fly used gene mutation methods to identify genes involved in memory formation. Presumably, memory creation involves a combination of genes, pathways, and neural circuits. To examine memory formation at the protein level, a quantitative proteomic analysis was performed using olfactory learning and 15N-labeled fruit flies. Differences were observed in protein expression and relevant pathways between different learning programs. Our data showed major protein expression changes occurred between short-term memory (STM) and long-lasting memory, and only minor changes were found between long-term memory (LTM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM).",2014,"Yaoyang Zhang, Bing Shan, Monica Boyle, Jacqueline Liu, Lujian Liao, Tao Xu, John R Yates 3rd, Yaoyang Zhang, Bing Shan, Monica Boyle, Jacqueline Liu, Lujian Liao, Tao Xu, John R Yates 3rd"
Netrin and Frazzled regulate presynaptic gap junctions at a Drosophila giant synapse,24741033,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3183-13.2014,"Netrin and its receptor, Frazzled, dictate the strength of synaptic connections in the giant fiber system (GFS) of Drosophila melanogaster by regulating gap junction localization in the presynaptic terminal. In Netrin mutant animals, the synaptic coupling between a giant interneuron and the ""jump"" motor neuron was weakened and dye coupling between these two neurons was severely compromised or absent. In cases in which Netrin mutants displayed apparently normal synaptic anatomy, half of the specimens exhibited physiologically defective synapses and dye coupling between the giant fiber (GF) and the motor neuron was reduced or eliminated, suggesting that gap junctions were disrupted in the Netrin mutants. When we examined the gap junctions with antibodies to Shaking-B (ShakB) Innexin, they were significantly decreased or absent in the presynaptic terminal of the mutant GF.

Orthodenticle is required for the development of olfactory projection neurons and local interneurons in Drosophila,24996925,10.1242/bio.20148524,"The accurate wiring of nervous systems involves precise control over cellular processes like cell division, cell fate specification, and targeting of neurons. The nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model to understand these processes. Drosophila neurons are generated by stem cell like precursors called neuroblasts that are formed and specified in a highly stereotypical manner along the neuroectoderm. This stereotypy has been attributed, in part, to the expression and function of transcription factors that act as intrinsic cell fate determinants in the neuroblasts and their progeny during embryogenesis. Here we focus on the lateral neuroblast lineage, ALl1, of the antennal lobe and show that the transcription factor-encoding cephalic gap gene orthodenticle is required in this lineage during postembryonic brain development. We use immunolabelling to demonstrate that Otd is expressed in the neuroblast of this lineage during postembryonic larval stages. Subsequently, we use MARCM clonal mutational methods to show that the majority of the postembryonic neuronal progeny in the ALl1 lineage undergoes apoptosis in the absence of orthodenticle. Moreover, we demonstrate that the neurons that survive in the orthodenticle loss-of-function condition display severe targeting defects in both the proximal (dendritic) and distal (axonal) neurites. These findings indicate that the cephalic gap gene orthodenticle acts as an important intrinsic determinant in the ALl1 neuroblast lineage and, hence, could be a member of a putative combinatorial code involved in specifying the fate and identity of cells in this lineage.",2014,"Sonia Sen, Silvia Biagini, Heinrich Reichert, K VijayRaghavan, Sonia Sen, Silvia Biagini, Heinrich Reichert, K VijayRaghavan"
The Drosophila Werner exonuclease participates in an exonuclease-independent response to replication stress,24709634,10.1534/genetics.114.164228,"Members of the RecQ family of helicases are known for their roles in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. Mutations in the human RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM, cause Werner and Bloom syndromes, which are diseases characterized by genome instability and an increased risk of cancer. While WRN contains both a helicase and an exonuclease domain, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog, WRNexo, contains only the exonuclease domain. Therefore the Drosophila model system provides a unique opportunity to study the exonuclease functions of WRN separate from the helicase. We created a null allele of WRNexo via imprecise P-element excision. The null WRNexo mutants are not sensitive to double-strand break-inducing reagents, suggesting that the exonuclease does not play a key role in homologous recombination-mediated repair of DSBs. However, WRNexo mutant embryos have a reduced hatching frequency and larvae are sensitive to the replication fork-stalling reagent, hydroxyurea (HU), suggesting that WRNexo is important in responding to replication stress. The role of WRNexo in the HU-induced stress response is independent of Rad51. Interestingly, the hatching defect and HU sensitivity of WRNexo mutants do not occur in flies containing an exonuclease-dead copy of WRNexo, suggesting that the role of WRNexo in replication is independent of exonuclease activity. Additionally, WRNexo and Blm mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to HU and synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in structure-selective endonucleases. We propose that WRNexo and BLM interact to promote fork reversal following replication fork stalling and in their absence regressed forks are restarted through a Rad51-mediated process.",2014,"Elyse Bolterstein, Rachel Rivero, Melissa Marquez, Mitch McVey, Elyse Bolterstein, Rachel Rivero, Melissa Marquez, Mitch McVey"
Nitric oxide levels regulate the immune response of Drosophila melanogaster reference laboratory strains to bacterial infections,25047850,10.1128/IAI.02318-14,"Studies on the innate immune response against microbial infections in Drosophila melanogaster involve mutant strains and their reference strains that act as experimental controls. We used five standard D. melanogaster laboratory reference strains (Oregon R, w1118, Canton-S, Cinnabar Brown, and Yellow White [YW]) and investigated their response against two pathogenic bacteria (Photorhabdus luminescens and Enterococcus faecalis) and two nonpathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). We detected high sensitivity among YW flies to bacterial infections and increased bacterial growth compared to the other strains. We also found variation in the transcription of certain antimicrobial peptide genes among strains, with Oregon and YW infected flies showing the highest and lowest gene transcription levels in most cases. We show that Oregon and w1118 flies possess more circulating hemocytes and higher levels of phenoloxidase activity than the other strains upon infection with the nonpathogenic bacteria. We further observed reduced fat accumulation in YW flies infected with the pathogenic bacteria, which suggests a possible decline in physiological condition. Finally, we found that nitrite levels are significantly lower in infected and uninfected YW flies compared to w1118 flies and that nitric oxide synthase mutant flies in YW background are more susceptible to bacterial infection compared to mutants in w1118 background. Therefore, increased sensitivity of YW flies to bacterial infections can be partly attributed to lower levels of nitric oxide. Such studies will significantly contribute toward a better understanding of the genetic variation between D. melanogaster reference strains.",2014,"Ioannis Eleftherianos, Kareen More, Stephanie Spivack, Ethan Paulin, Arman Khojandi, Sajala Shukla, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Kareen More, Stephanie Spivack, Ethan Paulin, Arman Khojandi, Sajala Shukla"
The Knickkopf DOMON domain is essential for cuticle differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,24723222,10.1002/arch.21165,"The dopamine monoxygenase N-terminal (DOMON) domain is found in extracellular proteins across several eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa. It has been proposed that this domain binds to heme or sugar moieties. Here, we have analyzed the role of four highly conserved amino acids in the DOMON domain of the Drosophila melanogaster Knickkopf protein that is inserted into the apical plasma membrane and assists extracellular chitin organization. In principal, we generated Knickkopf versions with exchanged residues tryptophan(299), methionine(333), arginine(401), or histidine(437), and scored for the ability of the respective engineered protein to normalize the knickkopf mutant phenotype. Our results confirm the absolute necessity of tryptophan(299), methionine(333), and histidine(437) for Knickkopf function and stability, the latter two being predicted to be critical for heme binding. In contrast, arginine(401) is required for full efficiency of Knickkopf activity. Taken together, our genetic data support the prediction of these residues to mediate the function of Knickkopf during cuticle differentiation in insects. Hence, the DOMON domain is apparently an essential factor contributing to the construction of polysaccharide-based extracellular matrices.",2014,"Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Yiwen Wang, L Aravind, Bernard Moussian, Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Yiwen Wang, L Aravind, Bernard Moussian"

The fly was used as a model system to measure the extent of toxicity of these peptides. The results showed that concentrations below 10 mg/ml are not significantly effective. When exposed to 10 mg/ml of AMPs LR14, acute toxic effect and a significant delay in the developmental cycle of the fly could be observed. Also, the weight and size of the flies were significantly reduced upon ingestion of these peptides. Higher concentrations (beyond 15 mg/ml) exerted a strong larvicidal effect.

Herbicide paraquat induces sex-specific variation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in Drosophila melanogaster,25823231,,"There are several reports on herbicide paraquat (PQ)-induced Parkinsonian-like pathology in different animal models, including Drosophila melanogaster.

In this study, the inflammatory response was examined in Drosophila model during PQ-induced neurodegeneration. We found that after exposure to PQ, survivability and locomotion ability were affected in both sexes of Drosophila. Behavioural symptoms indicated similar physiological features of Parkinson's disease (PD) in different animal models, as well as in humans. Our study revealed alteration in proinflamatory factor, TNF-Î± and Eiger (the Drosophila homologue in TNF superfamily) was changed in PQ-treated Drosophila both at protein and mRNA level during neurodegeneration. To ensure the occurrence of neurodegeneration, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neuronal cell loss was considered as a hallmark of PD in the fly brain.

Drosophila 3' UTRs are more complex than protein-coding sequences,24824035,10.1371/journal.pone.0097336,"The 3' UTRs of eukaryotic genes participate in a variety of post-transcriptional (and some transcriptional) regulatory interactions.

Here we propose a sensitive segmentation methodology for investigating patterns of composition and conservation in 3' UTRs based on comparison of closely related species. We describe encodings of pairwise and three-way alignments integrating information about conservation, GC content and transition/transversion ratios and apply the method to three closely related Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba. Incorporating multiple data types greatly increased the number of segment classes identified compared to similar methods based on conservation or GC content alone. We propose that the number of segments and number of types of segment identified by the method can be used as proxies for functional complexity. Our main finding is that the number of segments and segment classes identified in 3' UTRs is greater than in the same length of protein-coding sequence, suggesting greater functional complexity in 3' UTRs.

Discovery of supernumerary B chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster,24478336,10.1534/genetics.113.160556,"B chromosomes are small, heterochromatic chromosomes that are transmitted in a non-Mendelian manner. We have identified a stock of Drosophila melanogaster that recently (within the last decade) acquired an average of 10 B chromosomes per fly. These B chromosomes are transmitted by both males and females and can be maintained for multiple generations in a wild-type genetic background despite the fact that they cause high levels of 4(th) chromosome meiotic nondisjunction in females. Most curiously, these B chromosomes are mitotically unstable, suggesting either the absence of critical chromosomal sites or the inability of the meiotic or mitotic systems to cope with many additional chromosomes. These B chromosomes also contain centromeres and are primarily composed of the heterochromatic AATAT satellite sequence. Although the AATAT sequence comprises the majority of the 4(th) chromosome heterochromatin, the B chromosomes lack most, if not all, 4(th) chromosome euchromatin. Presumably as a consequence of their heterochromatic content, these B chromosomes significantly modify position-effect variegation in two separate reporter systems, acting as enhancers of variegation in one case and suppressors in the other. The identification of B chromosomes in a genetically tractable organism like D. melanogaster will facilitate studies of chromosome evolution and the analysis of the mechanisms by which meiotic and mitotic processes cope with additional chromosomes.",2014,"Elisabeth Bauerly, Stacie E Hughes, Dana R Vietti, Danny E Miller, William McDowell, R Scott Hawley, Elisabeth Bauerly, Stacie E Hughes, Dana R Vietti, Danny E Miller, William McDowell, R Scott Hawley"

Chitosan/siRNA nanoparticle targeting demonstrates a requirement for single-minded during larval and pupal olfactory system development of the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti,24552425,10.1186/1471-213X-14-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Essentially nothing is known about the genetic regulation of olfactory system development in vector mosquitoes, which use olfactory cues to detect blood meal hosts. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have identified a regulatory matrix of transcription factors that controls pupal/adult odorant receptor (OR) gene expression in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). However, it is unclear if transcription factors that function in the D. melanogaster regulatory matrix are required for OR expression in mosquitoes. Furthermore, the regulation of OR expression during development of the larval olfactory system, which is far less complex than that of pupae/adults, is not well understood in any insect, including D. melanogaster. Here, we examine the regulation of OR expression in the developing larval olfactory system of Aedes aegypti, the dengue vector mosquito.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A. aegypti bears orthologs of eight transcription factors that regulate OR expression in D. melanogaster pupae/adults. These transcription factors are expressed in A. aegypti larval antennal sensory neurons, and consensus binding sites for these transcription factors reside in the 5' flanking regions of A. aegypti OR genes. Consensus binding sites for Single-minded (Sim) are located adjacent to over half the A. aegypti OR genes, suggesting that this transcription factor functions as a major regulator of mosquito OR expression. To functionally test this hypothesis, chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles were used to target sim during larval olfactory development. These experiments demonstrated that Sim positively regulates expression of a large subset of OR genes, including orco, the obligate co-receptor in the assembly and function of heteromeric OR/Orco complexes. Decreased innervation of the antennal lobe was also noted in sim knockdown larvae. These OR expression and antennal lobe defects correlated with a larval odorant tracking behavioral defect. OR expression and antennal lobe defects were also observed in sim knockdown pupae.

Trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is one of the most widely studied histone post-translational modifications, and has been linked to transcriptional repression. In Drosophila melanogaster, Windei is needed for H3K9me3 in female germ line cells. Here, we report the occurrence of a D. melanogaster Windei (Wde) ortholog in the ovary of the hemimetabolous insect Blattella germanica, which we named BgWde. Depletion of BgWde by RNAi reduced H3K9me3 in follicular cells, which triggered changes in transcriptional regulation that led to the prevention of chorion gene expression. In turn, this impaired oviposition (and the formation of the ootheca) and, therefore, prevented reproduction. Windei and H3K9me3 have already been reported in follicular cells of D. melanogaster, but this is the first time that the function of these modifications has been demonstrated in the said cells.

We show here that SSEs can spread via DNA break-induced homologous recombination, a process known as 'homing' similar to that observed for homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), despite their fundamentally different modes of DNA binding and cleavage. We observed that TALEN and ZFN have a reduced capability of secondary homing compared to HEG as their repetitive structure had a negative effect on their genetic stability.

Automated annotation of developmental stages of Drosophila embryos in images containing spatial patterns of expression,24300439,10.1093/bioinformatics/btt648,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is a major model organism for investigating the function and interconnection of animal genes in the earliest stages of embryogenesis. Today, images capturing Drosophila gene expression patterns are being produced at a higher throughput than ever before. The analysis of spatial patterns of gene expression is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are compared. Thus, the critical first step is to determine the developmental stage of an embryo. This information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over developmental time. Currently, developmental stages (time) of embryos in images capturing spatial expression pattern are annotated manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Embryos are often designated into stage ranges, making the information on developmental time course. This makes downstream analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression patterns challenging, particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression patterns of large number of images.

      Here, we present a new computational approach to annotate developmental stage for Drosophila embryos in the gene expression images. In an analysis of 3724 images, the new approach shows high accuracy in predicting the developmental stage correctly (79%). In addition, it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely annotate each embryo so that they are divided into early and late periods of development within standard stage demarcations. Stage scores for all images containing expression patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over developmental time for any gene. We show that the genomewide-expression-maps generated using images from embryos in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better, and more refined stage annotations improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between genes.

SiRNA screens using Drosophila cells to identify host factors required for infection,25172284,10.1007/978-1-4939-1261-2_13,"Drosophila melanogaster offers a powerful model system for interrogating interactions between host cells and human bacterial pathogens. Brucella, a gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium is the causative agent of brucellosis, a zoonotic disease of global consequence. Over the past several decades, pathogen factors that mediate Brucella infection have been identified. However, host factors that mediate infection have remained obscure. We have used the power of the Drosophila S2 cell system to identify and characterize host factors that support infection by Brucella melitensis. Host protein inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1Î±), a transmembrane kinase and master regulator of the eukaryotic unfolded protein response, was shown to play an important role in regulating Brucella infection, thereby providing the first glimpse of host mechanisms that are subverted by the pathogen to support its intracellular lifestyle. Furthermore, our study also established the Drosophila S2 cell as a powerful system for elucidating Brucella host factors. Here, we describe a protocol for using the Drosophila S2 cell system for studying the Brucella-host interaction.",2014,"Aseem Pandey, Sheng Li Ding, Thomas A Ficht, Paul de Figueiredo, Aseem Pandey, Sheng Li Ding, Thomas A Ficht, Paul de Figueiredo"

The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster,24137011,10.1093/nar/gkt909,"RNA editing by deamination of specific adenosine bases to inosines during pre-mRNA processing generates edited isoforms of proteins. Recoding RNA editing is more widespread in Drosophila than in vertebrates. Editing levels rise strongly at metamorphosis, and Adar(5G1) null mutant flies lack editing events in hundreds of CNS transcripts; mutant flies have reduced viability, severely defective locomotion and age-dependent neurodegeneration. On the other hand, overexpressing an adult dADAR isoform with high enzymatic activity ubiquitously during larval and pupal stages is lethal. Advantage was taken of this to screen for genetic modifiers; Adar overexpression lethality is rescued by reduced dosage of the Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin), gene encoding a subunit of inhibitory GABA receptors. Reduced dosage of the Gad1 gene encoding the GABA synthetase also rescues Adar overexpression lethality. Drosophila Adar(5G1) mutant phenotypes are ameliorated by feeding GABA modulators. We demonstrate that neuronal excitability is linked to dADAR expression levels in individual neurons; Adar-overexpressing larval motor neurons show reduced excitability whereas Adar(5G1) null mutant or targeted Adar knockdown motor neurons exhibit increased excitability. GABA inhibitory signalling is impaired in human epileptic and autistic conditions, and vertebrate ADARs may have a relevant evolutionarily conserved control over neuronal excitability.",2014,"Xianghua Li, Ian M Overton, Richard A Baines, Liam P Keegan, Mary A O'Connell, Xianghua Li, Ian M Overton, Richard A Baines, Liam P Keegan, Mary A O'Connell"

An ongoing role for structural sarcomeric components in maintaining Drosophila melanogaster muscle function and structure,24915196,10.1371/journal.pone.0099362,"Animal muscles must maintain their function while bearing substantial mechanical loads. How muscles withstand persistent mechanical strain is presently not well understood. The basic unit of muscle is the sarcomere, which is primarily composed of cytoskeletal proteins. We hypothesized that cytoskeletal protein turnover is required to maintain muscle function. Using the flight muscles of Drosophila melanogaster, we confirmed that the sarcomeric cytoskeleton undergoes turnover throughout adult life. To uncover which cytoskeletal components are required to maintain adult muscle function, we performed an RNAi-mediated knockdown screen targeting the entire fly cytoskeleton and associated proteins. Gene knockdown was restricted to adult flies and muscle function was analyzed with behavioural assays. Here we analyze the results of that screen and characterize the specific muscle maintenance role for several hits. The screen identified 46 genes required for muscle maintenance: 40 of which had no previously known role in this process. Bioinformatic analysis highlighted the structural sarcomeric proteins as a candidate group for further analysis. Detailed confocal and electron microscopic analysis showed that while muscle architecture was maintained after candidate gene knockdown, sarcomere length was disrupted. Specifically, we found that ongoing synthesis and turnover of the key sarcomere structural components Projectin, Myosin and Actin are required to maintain correct sarcomere length and thin filament length. Our results provide in vivo evidence of adult muscle protein turnover and uncover specific functional defects associated with reduced expression of a subset of cytoskeletal proteins in the adult animal.",2014,"Alexander D Perkins, Guy Tanentzapf, Alexander D Perkins, Guy Tanentzapf"
Genetic dissection of the Drosophila melanogaster female head transcriptome reveals widespread allelic heterogeneity,24810915,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004322,"Modern genetic mapping is plagued by the ""missing heritability"" problem, which refers to the discordance between the estimated heritabilities of quantitative traits and the variance accounted for by mapped causative variants. One major potential explanation for the missing heritability is allelic heterogeneity, in which there are multiple causative variants at each causative gene with only a fraction having been identified. The majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicitly assume that a single SNP can explain all the variance for a causative locus. However, if allelic heterogeneity is prevalent, a substantial amount of genetic variance will remain unexplained. In this paper, we take a haplotype-based mapping approach and quantify the number of alleles segregating at each locus using a large set of 7922 eQTL contributing to regulatory variation in the Drosophila melanogaster female head. Not only does this study provide a comprehensive eQTL map for a major community genetic resource, the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource, but it also provides a direct test of the allelic heterogeneity hypothesis. We find that 95% of cis-eQTLs and 78% of trans-eQTLs are due to multiple alleles, demonstrating that allelic heterogeneity is widespread in Drosophila eQTL. Allelic heterogeneity likely contributes significantly to the missing heritability problem common in GWAS studies.",2014,"Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald, Elizabeth G King, Brian J Sanderson, Casey L McNeil, Anthony D Long, Stuart J Macdonald"
Regulation of dopamine release by CASK-Î² modulates locomotor initiation in Drosophila melanogaster,25477794,10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00394,"CASK is an evolutionarily conserved scaffolding protein that has roles in many cell types. In Drosophila, loss of the entire CASK gene or just the CASK-Î² transcript causes a complex set of adult locomotor defects. In this study, we show that the motor initiation component of this phenotype is due to loss of CASK-Î² in dopaminergic neurons and can be specifically rescued by expression of CASK-Î² within this subset of neurons. Functional imaging demonstrates that mutation of CASK-Î² disrupts coupling of neuronal activity to vesicle fusion. Consistent with this, locomotor initiation can be rescued by artificially driving activity in dopaminergic neurons. The molecular mechanism underlying this role of CASK-Î² in dopaminergic neurons involves interaction with Hsc70-4, a molecular chaperone previously shown to regulate calcium-dependent vesicle fusion. These data suggest that there is a novel CASK-Î²-dependent regulatory complex in dopaminergic neurons that serves to link activity and neurotransmitter release.",2014,"Justin B Slawson, Elena A Kuklin, Konark Mukherjee, NicolÃ¡s PÃ­rez, Nathan C Donelson, Leslie C Griffith, Justin B Slawson, Elena A Kuklin, Konark Mukherjee, NicolÃ¡s PÃ­rez, Nathan C Donelson, Leslie C Griffith"
Exposure to bisphenol A affects lipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster,24215246,10.1111/bcpt.12170,"Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) in rodents was shown to induce obesity, yet the mechanism by which BPA might induce obesity is still unclear. We employed the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to test the effects of raising them on food containing various concentrations of BPA. Of note, raising males on food containing BPA were susceptible to starvation, possibly by inhibiting their ability to perform lipolysis during starvation, leading to significantly increased lipid content after 24 hr of fasting. Furthermore, feeding males with BPA significantly inhibited the expression of insulin-like peptides. From these results, we conclude that BPA may inhibit lipid recruitment during starvation in Drosophila.",2014,"Michael J Williams, Yi Wang, Anica Klockars, P Monica Lind, Robert Fredriksson, Helgi B SchiÃ¶th, Michael J Williams, Yi Wang, Anica Klockars, P Monica Lind, Robert Fredriksson, Helgi B SchiÃ¶th"
[Transcription factor comr acts as a direct activator in the genetic program controlling spermatogenesis in D. melanogaster],25842836,,"Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, UK). In Drosophila melanogaster differentiation of the male germ cells is accompanied by chromatin rearrangement and activation of the specific genes. These processes are regulated by few transcription factors that belong to two classes, can and aly that form distinct functional complexes. Mechanisms of action of aly and can class transcription factors on gene expression and chromatin state remain unclear. To investigate this question we have built the whole genome binding profile of transcription factor Comr belonging to aly class using the tissue-specific DamID method. Resulting datawere correlated with gene expression in comr (aly class) and can (can class) mutant testes. It was shown that Comr is a direct activator for about 300 testis-specific genes. Furthermore a set of genes revealed decreased expression in comr mutants but did not bind Comr protein, suggesting the existence of secondary regulation. Indeed, among the Comr gene targets we found a gene coding an uncharacterized transcription factor that could be a secondary participant in the genetic pathway in spermatocytes. These date allowed us to advance a model of gene activation needed for male gametes differentiation in D. melanogaster.",2014,"P P Laktionov, H White-Cooper, D A Maksimov, S N Beliakin, P P Laktionov, H White-Cooper, D A Maksimov, S N Beliakin"
Non-coding roX RNAs prevent the binding of the MSL-complex to heterochromatic regions,25501352,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004865,"Long non-coding RNAs contribute to dosage compensation in both mammals and Drosophila by inducing changes in the chromatin structure of the X-chromosome. In Drosophila melanogaster, roX1 and roX2 are long non-coding RNAs that together with proteins form the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex, which coats the entire male X-chromosome and mediates dosage compensation by increasing its transcriptional output. Studies on polytene chromosomes have demonstrated that when both roX1 and roX2 are absent, the MSL-complex becomes less abundant on the male X-chromosome and is relocated to the chromocenter and the 4th chromosome. Here we address the role of roX RNAs in MSL-complex targeting and the evolution of dosage compensation in Drosophila. We performed ChIP-seq experiments which showed that MSL-complex recruitment to high affinity sites (HAS) on the X-chromosome is independent of roX and that the HAS sequence motif is conserved in D. simulans. Additionally, a complete and enzymatically active MSL-complex is recruited to six specific genes on the 4th chromosome. Interestingly, our sequence analysis showed that in the absence of roX RNAs, the MSL-complex has an affinity for regions enriched in Hoppel transposable elements and repeats in general. We hypothesize that roX mutants reveal the ancient targeting of the MSL-complex and propose that the role of roX RNAs is to prevent the binding of the MSL-complex to heterochromatin.",2014,"Margarida L A Figueiredo, Maria Kim, Philge Philip, Anders Allgardsson, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson, Margarida L A Figueiredo, Maria Kim, Philge Philip, Anders Allgardsson, Per Stenberg, Jan Larsson"
Retrograde neurotrophin signaling through Tollo regulates synaptic growth in Drosophila,24662564,10.1083/jcb.201308115,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are best characterized for their roles in mediating dorsoventral patterning and the innate immune response. However, recent studies indicate that TLRs are also involved in regulating neuronal growth and development. Here, we demonstrate that the TLR Tollo positively regulates growth of the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Tollo mutants exhibited NMJ undergrowth, whereas increased expression of Tollo led to NMJ overgrowth. Tollo expression in the motoneuron was both necessary and sufficient for regulating NMJ growth. Dominant genetic interactions together with altered levels of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and puc-lacZ expression revealed that Tollo signals through the JNK pathway at the NMJ. Genetic interactions also revealed that the neurotrophin SpÃ¤tzle3 (Spz3) is a likely Tollo ligand. Spz3 expression in muscle and proteolytic activation via the Easter protease was necessary and sufficient to promote NMJ growth. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel neurotrophin signaling pathway that is required for synaptic development in Drosophila.",2014,"Shannon L Ballard, Daniel L Miller, Barry Ganetzky, Shannon L Ballard, Daniel L Miller, Barry Ganetzky"
Environmental temperature modulates olfactory reception in Drosophila melanogaster,21924272,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.08.016,"Sensory systems, including the olfactory system, are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In nature, changes in temperature modify the volatility and concentration of odorants in the air. If the olfactory system does not adapt to these changes, it could relay wrong information about the distance to or direction of odor sources. Recent behavioral studies in Drosophila melanogaster showed olfactory acclimation to temperature. In this report, we investigated if temperature affects olfaction at the level of the receptors themselves. With this aim, we performed electroantennograms (EAGs) and single sensillum recordings (SSRs) to measure the response to several odorants in flies that had been submitted to temperature treatments. In response to all tested odorants, the amplitude of the EAGs increased in flies that had been exposed to a higher temperature and decreased after cold treatment, revealing that at least part of the reported change in olfactory perception happens at reception level. SSRs of odorant stimulated basiconic sensilla ab2 and ab3 showed some changes in the number of spikes after heat or cold treatment. However, the number and shape of spontaneous action potentials were unaffected, suggesting that the observed changes related specifically to the olfactory function of the neurons.",2011,"Fernando Martin, Jacob Riveron, Esther Alcorta, Fernando Martin, Jacob Riveron, Esther Alcorta"
Generating a knockdown transgene against Drosophila heterochromatic Tim17b gene encoding mitochondrial translocase subunit,21998726,10.1371/journal.pone.0025945,"Heterochromatic regions of eukaryotic genomes contain multiple functional elements involved in chromosomal dynamics, as well as multiple housekeeping genes.

Here, we report the development of an RNAi-based knockdown transgenic construct and red fluorescent reporter transgene for a small gene, Tim17b, which localizes in constitutive heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster third chromosome and encodes a mitochondrial translocase subunit. We demonstrate that Tim17b protein is required strictly for protein delivery to mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of Tim17b completely disrupts functions of the mitochondrial translocase complex. Using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay, we show that Tim17b protein has a very stable localization in the membranes of the mitochondrial network and that its exchange rate is close to zero when compared with soluble proteins of mitochondrial matrix.

Comparative genomic analysis of Drosophila melanogaster and vector mosquito developmental genes,21754989,10.1371/journal.pone.0021504,"Genome sequencing projects have presented the opportunity for analysis of developmental genes in three vector mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Anopheles gambiae.

While the study was comprehensive, special emphasis centered on genes that 1) are components of developmental signaling pathways, 2) regulate fundamental developmental processes, 3) are critical for the development of tissues of vector importance, 4) function in developmental processes known to have diverged within insects, and 5) encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate developmental transcripts in Drosophila. While most fruit fly developmental genes are conserved in the three vector mosquito species, several genes known to be critical for Drosophila development were not identified in one or more mosquito genomes. In other cases, mosquito lineage-specific gene gains with respect to D. melanogaster were noted. Sequence analyses also revealed that numerous repetitive sequences are a common structural feature of Drosophila and mosquito developmental genes. Finally, analysis of predicted miRNA binding sites in fruit fly and mosquito developmental genes suggests that the repertoire of developmental genes targeted by miRNAs is species-specific.

The Drosophila javelin gene encodes a novel actin-associated protein required for actin assembly in the bristle,21930794,10.1128/MCB.05730-11,"The Drosophila melanogaster bristle is a highly polarized cell that builds specialized cytoskeletal structures. Whereas actin is required for increasing bristle length, microtubules are essential for bristle axial growth. To identify new proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization during bristle development, we focused on identifying and characterizing the javelin (jv) locus. We found that in a jv mutant, the bristle tip is swollen and abnormal organization of bristle grooves is seen over the entire bristle. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we found that in jv mutant bristles, actin bundles do not form properly due to a loss of actin filaments within the bundle. We show that jv is an allele of the predicted CG32397 gene that encodes a protein with no homologs outside insects. Expression of the Jv protein fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) shows that the protein is colocalized with actin bundles in the bristle. Moreover, expression of Jv-GFP within the germ line led to the formation of ectopic actin bundles that surround the nucleus of nurse cells. Thus, we report that Jv is a novel actin-associated protein required for actin assembly during Drosophila bristle development.",2011,"Shira Shapira, Anna Bakhrat, Amir Bitan, Uri Abdu, Shira Shapira, Anna Bakhrat, Amir Bitan, Uri Abdu"

Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for human brain cancers,21538561,10.1002/glia.21148,"Glioblastomas (GBM), the most common primary brain tumors, infiltrate the brain, grow rapidly, and are refractory to current therapies. Signature genetic lesions in glioblastomas include mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) receptor tyrosine kinase and activating mutations in components of the PI-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. Despite years of study, how these pathways specifically regulate glial pathogenesis is unclear. To address the genetic and cellular origins of this disease, a novel Drosophila GBM model has been developed in which glial progenitor cells give rise to proliferative and invasive neoplastic cells that create transplantable tumors in response to constitutive co-activation of the EGFR-Ras and PI3K pathways. Standing with a rich literature demonstrating the direct relevance of Drosophila to studies on human cancer, neurological disease, and neurodevelopment, this model represents a robust cell-type specific Drosophila neurological disease model in which malignant cells are created by mutations in genetic pathways thought to be driving forces in a homologous human disease. Using lineage analysis and cell-type specific markers, neoplastic glial cells were found to originate from committed glial progenitor cells, rather than from multipotent neuroblasts. Genetic analyses demonstrated that EGFR-Ras and PI3K induce fly glial neoplasia through activation of a combinatorial genetic network composed, in part, of other genetic pathways also commonly mutated in human glioblastomas. In the future, large-scale forward genetic screens with this model may reveal new insights into the origins and treatments of human glioblastoma.",2011,"Renee D Read, Renee D Read"
Genotoxic effects of two nickel-compounds in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21073980,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.10.008,"In view of the scarcely available information on the in vivo mutagenic and co-mutagenic activity of nickel, the genotoxic potential of two nickel-compounds, nickel chloride (NiCl(2)) and nickel sulphate (NiSO(4)), was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring two different genetic endpoints. On the one hand, we used the wing-spot assay, which is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of two suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr(3)), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larval cells. On the other hand, the in vivo comet assay, which detects single- and double-strand DNA breaks, was also used with larval haemocytes. These cells offer several advantages: they are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, the sampling and processing methodologies are quite simple and the level of basal DNA damage is relatively low. No significant increases in the frequencies of the three categories of mutant spots (i.e. small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots) were observed in the wing-spot assay; however, NiSO(4) induced significant dose-dependent increases in DNA damage in the comet assay. In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and NiCl(2) and NiSO(4) showed a slight but significant increase in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone, indicating that both nickel compounds have a synergistic interaction. These results support the assumption that both nickel compounds could act as co-mutagens interfering with DNA-repair processes and that the in vivo comet assay is a sensitive and effective method for detecting the DNA damage induced by NiSO(4) in haemocytes of D. melanogaster.",2011,"Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos, Erico R Carmona, Amadeu Creus, R Marcos"

Recurrent adaptation in RNA interference genes across the Drosophila phylogeny,20971974,10.1093/molbev/msq284,"RNA interference (RNAi) is quickly emerging as a vital component of genome organization, gene regulation, and immunity in Drosophila and other species.

Here, we characterize the extent and patterns of adaptive evolution in 23 known Drosophila RNAi genes, both within D. melanogaster and across the Drosophila phylogeny. We find strong evidence for recurrent protein-coding adaptation at a large number of RNAi genes, particularly those involved in antiviral immunity and defense against transposable elements. We identify specific functional domains involved in direct protein-RNA interactions as particular hotspots of recurrent adaptation in multiple RNAi genes, suggesting that targeted coadaptive arms races may be a general feature of RNAi evolution.

Homologous pairing and the role of pairing centers in meiosis,21625006,10.1242/jcs.006387,"Homologous pairing establishes the foundation for accurate reductional segregation during meiosis I in sexual organisms. This Commentary summarizes recent progress in our understanding of homologous pairing in meiosis, and will focus on the characteristics and mechanisms of specialized chromosome sites, called pairing centers (PCs), in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. In C. elegans, each chromosome contains a single PC that stabilizes chromosome pairing and initiates synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Specific zinc-finger proteins recruited to PCs link chromosomes to nuclear envelope proteins--and through them to the microtubule cytoskeleton--thereby stimulating chromosome movements in early prophase, which are thought to be important for homolog sorting. This mechanism appears to be a variant of the 'telomere bouquet' process, in which telomeres cluster on the nuclear envelope, connect chromosomes through nuclear envelope proteins to the cytoskeleton and lead chromosome movements that promote homologous synapsis. In Drosophila males, which undergo meiosis without recombination, pairing of the largely non-homologous X and Y chromosomes occurs at specific repetitive sequences in the ribosomal DNA. Although no other clear examples of PC-based pairing mechanisms have been described, there is evidence for special roles of telomeres and centromeres in aspects of chromosome pairing, synapsis and segregation; these roles are in some cases similar to those of PCs.",2011,"Jui-He Tsai, Bruce D McKee, Jui-He Tsai, Bruce D McKee"
Functional test of the influence of Wolbachia genes on cytoplasmic incompatibility expression in Drosophila melanogaster,20854481,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2010.01042.x,"Wolbachia are inherited intracellular bacteria that infect a broad range of invertebrate hosts. They commonly manipulate host reproduction in a variety of ways and thereby favour their invasion into host populations. While the biology of Wolbachia has been extensively studied at the ecological and phenotypic level, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Wolbachia and their hosts. Recent comparative genomics studies of Wolbachia strains have revealed putative candidate genes involved in the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in insects. However the functional testing of these genes is hindered by the lack of available genetic tools in Wolbachia. To circumvent this problem we generated transgenic Drosophila lines expressing various Wolbachia CI candidate genes under the control of the GAL4/UAS system in order to evaluate their possible role in Wolbachia-related phenotypes in Drosophila. The expression of a number of these genes in Drosophila melanogaster failed to mimic or alter CI phenotypes across a range of Wolbachia backgrounds or in the absence of Wolbachia.",2011,"R Yamada, I Iturbe-Ormaetxe, J C Brownlie, S L O'Neill, R Yamada, I Iturbe-Ormaetxe, J C Brownlie, S L O'Neill"
The effect of the dibenzylbutyrolactolic lignan (-)-cubebin on doxorubicin mutagenicity and recombinogenicity in wing somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,21385598,10.1016/j.fct.2011.03.001,"The dibenzylbutyrolactolic lignan (-)-cubebin was isolated from dry seeds of Piper cubeba L. (Piperaceae). (-)-Cubebin possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antimicrobial activities. Doxorubicin (DXR) is a topoisomerase-interactive agent that may induce single- and double-strand breaks, intercalate into the DNA and generate oxygen free radicals. Here, we examine the mutagenicity and recombinogenicity of different concentrations of (-)-cubebin alone or in combination with DXR using standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) crosses of the wing Somatic Mutation And Recombination Test in Drosophila melanogaster. The results from both crosses were rather similar. (-)-Cubebin alone did not induce mutation or recombination. At lower concentrations, (-)-cubebin statistically reduced the frequencies of DXR-induced mutant spots. At higher concentrations, however, (-)-cubebin was found to potentiate the effects of DXR, leading to either an increase in the production of mutant spots or a reduction, due to toxicity. These results suggest that depending on the concentration, (-)-cubebin may interact with the enzymatic system that catalyzes the metabolic detoxification of DXR, inhibiting the activity of mitochondrial complex I and thereby scavenging free radicals. Recombination was found to be the major effect of the treatments with DXR alone. The combined treatments reduced DXR mutagenicity but did not affect DXR recombinogenicity.",2011,"A A A de Rezende, M L A e Silva, D C Tavares, W R Cunha, K C S Rezende, J K Bastos, M Lehmann, H H R de Andrade, Z R Guterres, L P Silva, M A SpanÃ³, A A A de Rezende, M L A e Silva, D C Tavares, W R Cunha, K C S Rezende, J K Bastos, M Lehmann, H H R de Andrade, Z R Guterres, L P Silva, M A SpanÃ³"
Molecular vibration-sensing component in Drosophila melanogaster olfaction,21321219,10.1073/pnas.1012293108,"A common explanation of molecular recognition by the olfactory system posits that receptors recognize the structure or shape of the odorant molecule. We performed a rigorous test of shape recognition by replacing hydrogen with deuterium in odorants and asking whether Drosophila melanogaster can distinguish these identically shaped isotopes. We report that flies not only differentiate between isotopic odorants, but can be conditioned to selectively avoid the common or the deuterated isotope. Furthermore, flies trained to discriminate against the normal or deuterated isotopes of a compound, selectively avoid the corresponding isotope of a different odorant. Finally, flies trained to avoid a deuterated compound exhibit selective aversion to an unrelated molecule with a vibrational mode in the energy range of the carbon-deuterium stretch. These findings are inconsistent with a shape-only model for smell, and instead support the existence of a molecular vibration-sensing component to olfactory reception.",2011,"Maria Isabel Franco, Luca Turin, Andreas Mershin, Efthimios M C Skoulakis, Maria Isabel Franco, Luca Turin, Andreas Mershin, Efthimios M C Skoulakis"
Lipid profiles of female and male Drosophila,21676256,10.1186/1756-0500-4-198,"Background:
      
    

    
      D. melanogaster is increasingly used as a lipid metabolism model, but the D. melanogaster metabolome is not well studied. A number of studies strongly suggest that lipid metabolism is linked to sexual behavior and gametogenesis.
    

    
  


        Findings:
      
    

    
      We determined the levels of 400 different lipids in the non-gonadal soma of D. melanogaster females and males. We found higher levels of saturated cholesterol esters and lysophosphatidylcholine in males, and higher levels of polyunsaturated cholesterol esters in females. We also determined the levels of these lipids in females and males without a germline to determine if the absence of gamete ""sinks"" for metabolic products, such as yolk and lipid deposits in eggs, altered somatic lipid profiles. We observed little change in lipid profiles between these samples.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Overall lipid compositions are similar between the sexes, although there are differences in saturation states of two lipid classes, where saturated fatty acids were male-biased and polyunsaturated fatty acids were female-biased. The presence of a germline did not significantly influence lipid profiles, raising the possibility that germline-dependent changes in metabolic gene expression patterns serve a homeostatic purpose.",2011,"Michael Parisi, Renhua Li, Brian Oliver, Michael Parisi, Renhua Li, Brian Oliver"
Evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of clustered microRNAs in Drosophila,21771325,10.1186/1471-2164-12-371,"Background:
      
    

    
      MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short 21-23nt RNAs capable of inhibiting translation of complementary target messenger RNAs. Almost half of D. melanogaster miRNA genes are grouped in genomic clusters.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The peculiarities of the expression of clustered miRNAs were studied using publicly available libraries of sequenced small RNAs from different Drosophila tissues. We have shown that although miRNAs from almost all clusters have similar tissue expression profiles (coordinated clusters), some clusters contain miRNAs with uncoordinated expression profiles. The predicted transcription start sites (TSSs) of such clusters are located upstream of the first miRNA, but no TSSs are found within the clusters. The expression profiles of miR and miR* sequences in uncoordinated clustered miRNAs do not correlate while their profiles from the coordinated clustered miRNAs are similar.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of exclusively upstream promoters in miRNA clusters containing uncoordinated miRNAs means that the clusters are transcribed as single transcription units. The difference of tissue expression profiles of uncoordinated miRNAs and the corresponding miRs* suggests a post-transcriptional regulation of their processing or stability.",2011,"Sergei S Ryazansky, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Eugene Berezikov, Sergei S Ryazansky, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Eugene Berezikov"
Natural variation in decision-making behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,21283727,10.1371/journal.pone.0016436,"There has been considerable recent interest in using Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the molecular basis of decision-making behavior. Deciding where to place eggs is likely one of the most important decisions for a female fly, as eggs are vulnerable and larvae have limited motility. Here, we show that many natural genotypes of D. melanogaster prefer to lay eggs near nutritious substrate, rather than in nutritious substrate. These preferences are highly polymorphic in both degree and direction, with considerable heritability (0.488) and evolvability.Relative preferences are modulated by the distance between options and the overall concentration of ethanol, suggesting Drosophila integrate many environmental factors when making oviposition decisions. As oviposition-related decisions can be efficiently assessed by simply counting eggs, oviposition behavior is an excellent model for understanding information processing in insects. Associating natural genetic polymorphisms with decision-making variation will shed light on the molecular basis of host choice behavior, the evolutionary maintenance of genetic variation, and the mechanistic nature of preference variation in general.",2011,"Paige M Miller, Julia B Saltz, Veronica A Cochrane, Caitlin M Marcinkowski, Raisa Mobin, Thomas L Turner"

        Organisms:
      
Drosophila melanogaster (host) and sigma virus (parasite).
    

    
  


        Field site:

        Empirical methods:
      
    

    
      We estimated prevalence in the field. We also estimated male and female transmission in the laboratory, using field-collected animals as parents. We further quantified patrilineal (father to son) transmission in the laboratory, and estimated cost of infection (virulence) by quantifying decreased egg production of infected flies.
    

    
  


        Mathematical methods:
      
    

    
      Discrete-time, deterministic models for prevalence; analysis of stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria; numerical computation of equilibria based on empirical estimates.

Lipin is a central regulator of adipose tissue development and function in Drosophila melanogaster,21300783,10.1128/MCB.01335-10,"Lipins are evolutionarily conserved proteins found from yeasts to humans. Mammalian and yeast lipin proteins have been shown to control gene expression and to enzymatically convert phosphatidate to diacylglycerol, an essential precursor in triacylglcerol (TAG) and phospholipid synthesis. Loss of lipin 1 in the mouse, but not in humans, leads to lipodystrophy and fatty liver disease. Here we show that the single lipin orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster (dLipin) is essential for normal adipose tissue (fat body) development and TAG storage. dLipin mutants are characterized by reductions in larval fat body mass, whole-animal TAG content, and lipid droplet size. Individual cells of the underdeveloped fat body are characterized by increased size and ultrastructural defects affecting cell nuclei, mitochondria, and autophagosomes. Under starvation conditions, dLipin is transcriptionally upregulated and functions to promote survival. Together, these data show that dLipin is a central player in lipid and energy metabolism, and they establish Drosophila as a genetic model for further studies of conserved functions of the lipin family of metabolic regulators.",2011,"Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann, Rupali Ugrankar, Yanling Liu, Jill Provaznik, Sandra Schmitt, Michael Lehmann"
Differentially expressed profiles in the larval testes of Wolbachia infected and uninfected Drosophila,22145623,10.1186/1471-2164-12-595,"Background:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria that are frequently found in arthropods and nematodes. These maternally inherited bacteria manipulate host reproduction by several mechanisms including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI is the most common phenotype induced by Wolbachia and results in the developmental arrest of embryos derived from crosses between Wolbachia-infected males and uninfected females. Although the molecular mechanisms of CI are currently unknown, several studies suggest that host sperm is modified by Wolbachia during spermatogenesis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We compared the gene expression of Drosophila melanogaster larval testes with and without the wMel strain of Wolbachia to identify candidate genes that could be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and the insect host. Microarray, quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses were carried out on D. melanogaster larval testes to determine the effect of Wolbachia infection on host gene expression. A total of 296 genes were identified by microarray analysis to have at least a 1.5 fold change [q-value < 5%] in expression. When comparing Wolbachia-infected flies to uninfected flies, 167 genes were up-regulated and 129 genes down-regulated. Differential expression of genes related to metabolism, immunity, reproduction and other functions were observed. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed 12 genes are differentially expressed in the testes of the 3rd instar larvae of Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Wolbachia infection changes the expression of several genes putatively associated with spermatogenesis including JH induced protein-26 and Mst84Db, or involved in immune (kenny) or metabolism (CG4988-RA).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia change the gene expression of 296 genes in the larval testes of D. melanogaster including genes related to metabolism, immunity and reproduction. Interestingly, most of the genes putatively involved in immunity were up-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. In contrast, most of the genes putatively associated with reproduction (especially spermatogenesis) were down-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. These results suggest Wolbachia may activate the immune pathway but inhibit spermatogenesis. Our data provide a significant panel of candidate genes that may be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and their insect hosts. This forms a basis to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Wolbachia-induced CI in Drosophila and the influence of Wolbachia on spermatogenesis.",2011,"Ya Zheng, Jia-Lin Wang, Chen Liu, Cui-Ping Wang, Thomas Walker, Yu-Feng Wang, Ya Zheng, Jia-Lin Wang, Chen Liu, Cui-Ping Wang, Thomas Walker, Yu-Feng Wang"
Homeostatic control of neural activity: a Drosophila model for drug tolerance and dependence,21906535,10.1016/B978-0-12-387003-2.00002-1,"Drug addiction is a complex condition of compulsive drug use that results in devastating physical and social consequences. Drosophila melanogaster has recently emerged as a valuable genetic model for investigating the mechanisms of addiction. Drug tolerance is a measurable endophenotype of addiction that can be easily generated and detected in animal models. The counteradaptive theory for drug dependence postulates that the homeostatic adaptations that produce drug tolerance become counteradaptive after drug clearance, resulting in symptoms of dependence. In flies, a single sedation with ethanol or with an organic solvent anesthetic (benzyl alcohol) induces functional tolerance, an adaptation of the nervous system that reduces the effect of these neural depressants. Here we review the role of the BK channel gene (slo) and genes that encode other synaptic proteins in the process of producing functional tolerance. These proteins are predicted to be part of an orchestrated response that involves specific interactions across a highly complex synaptic protein network. The response of the slo gene to drug exposure and the consequence of induced slo expression fit nicely the tenets of the counteradaptive theory for drug tolerance and dependence. Induction of slo expression represents an adaptive process that generates tolerance because it enhances neuronal excitability, which counters the sedative effects of the drugs. After drug clearance, however, the increase in slo expression leads to an allostatic withdrawal state that is characterized by an increase in the susceptibility for seizure. Together, these results demonstrate a common origin for development of drug tolerance and withdrawal hyperexcitability in Drosophila.",2011,"Alfredo Ghezzi, Nigel S Atkinson, Alfredo Ghezzi, Nigel S Atkinson"
"Effects of oxygen on growth and size: synthesis of molecular, organismal, and evolutionary studies with Drosophila melanogaster",20936942,10.1146/annurev-physiol-012110-142155,"Drosophila melanogaster is a model genetic organism with an exceptional hypoxia tolerance relative to mammals. Forward genetic, microarray, and P-element manipulations and selection experiments have revealed multiple mechanisms of severe hypoxia tolerance, including RNA editing, downregulation of metabolism, and prevention of protein unfolding. Drosophila live in microbe-rich, semiliquid food in which hypoxia likely indicates deteriorating environments. Hypoxia reduces growth and size by multiple mechanisms, influencing larval feeding rates, protein synthesis, imaginal cell size, and control of molting. In moderate hypoxia, these effects appear to occur without ATP limitation and are instead mediated by signaling systems, including hypoxia-inducible factor and atypical guanyl cyclase sensing of oxygen, with downstream actions on behavior, anabolism, and the cell cycle. In hypoxia, flies develop smaller sizes, but size does not evolve, whereas in hyperoxia, flies evolve larger sizes without exhibiting developmental size plasticity, suggesting differential evolutionary responses to natural versus novel directions of oxygen change.",2011,"Jon F Harrison, Gabriel G Haddad, Jon F Harrison, Gabriel G Haddad"

Long-term cold acclimation extends survival time at 0Â°C and modifies the metabolomic profiles of the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,21957472,10.1371/journal.pone.0025025,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is a chill-susceptible insect. Previous studies on this fly focused on acute direct chilling injury during cold shock and showed that lower lethal temperature (LLT, approximately -5Â°C) exhibits relatively low plasticity and that acclimations, both rapid cold hardening (RCH) and long-term cold acclimation, shift the LLT by only a few degrees at the maximum.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      We found that long-term cold acclimation considerably improved cold tolerance in fully grown third-instar larvae of D. melanogaster. A comparison of the larvae acclimated at constant 25Â°C with those acclimated at constant 15Â°C followed by constant 6Â°C for 2 d (15Â°C??Â°C) showed that long-term cold acclimation extended the lethal time for 50% of the population (Lt(50)) during exposure to constant 0Â°C as much as 630-fold (from 0.137 h to 86.658 h). Such marked physiological plasticity in Lt(50) (in contrast to LLT) suggested that chronic indirect chilling injury at 0Â°C differs from that caused by cold shock. Long-term cold acclimation modified the metabolomic profiles of the larvae. Accumulations of proline (up to 17.7 mM) and trehalose (up to 36.5 mM) were the two most prominent responses. In addition, restructuring of the glycerophospholipid composition of biological membranes was observed. The relative proportion of glycerophosphoethanolamines (especially those with linoleic acid at the sn-2 position) increased at the expense of glycerophosphocholines.

Here we present a simple genome sequencing protocol based on the whole-genome amplification of the gynogenetically derived haploid genome of a progeny of females mated to males homozygous for the recessive male sterile mutation, ms(3)K81. A single ""lane"" of paired-end sequences (2 ? 76 bp) provides a good syntenic assembly with >95% high-quality coverage (more than five reads). The amplification of the genomic DNA moderately inflates the variation in coverage across the euchromatic portion of the genome. It also increases the frequency of chimeric clones.

Conservation of an RNA regulatory map between Drosophila and mammals,20921232,10.1101/gr.108662.110,"Alternative splicing is generally controlled by proteins that bind directly to regulatory sequence elements and either activate or repress splicing of adjacent splice sites in a target pre-mRNA.

We identified 405 splicing events in 323 genes that are significantly affected upon depletion of ps, many of which were annotated as being constitutively spliced. The sequence regions upstream and within PS-repressed exons and downstream from PS-activated exons are enriched for YCAY repeats, and these are consistent with the location of these motifs near NOVA-regulated exons in mammals. Thus, the RNA regulatory map of PS and NOVA1/2 is highly conserved between insects and mammals despite the fact that the target gene orthologs regulated by PS and NOVA1/2 are almost entirely nonoverlapping.

Bm-Dronc has the sequence QACRG surrounding the catalytic site (C), which is consistent with the QAC(R/Q/G)(G/E) consensus sequence in most caspases but distinct from the sequences PFCRG and SICRG of Dm-Dronc and Aa-Dronc, respectively.

The COMPASS family of H3K4 methylases in Drosophila,21875999,10.1128/MCB.06092-11,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is implemented by Set1/COMPASS, which was originally purified based on the similarity of yeast Set1 to human MLL1 and Drosophila melanogaster Trithorax (Trx). While humans have six COMPASS family members, Drosophila possesses a representative of the three subclasses within COMPASS-like complexes: dSet1 (human SET1A/SET1B), Trx (human MLL1/2), and Trr (human MLL3/4). Here, we report the biochemical purification and molecular characterization of the Drosophila COMPASS family. We observed a one-to-one similarity in subunit composition with their mammalian counterparts, with the exception of LPT (lost plant homeodomains [PHDs] of Trr), which copurifies with the Trr complex. LPT is a previously uncharacterized protein that is homologous to the multiple PHD fingers found in the N-terminal regions of mammalian MLL3/4 but not Drosophila Trr, indicating that Trr and LPT constitute a split gene of an MLL3/4 ancestor. Our study demonstrates that all three complexes in Drosophila are H3K4 methyltransferases; however, dSet1/COMPASS is the major monoubiquitination-dependent H3K4 di- and trimethylase in Drosophila.

Consistent effects of a major QTL for thermal resistance in field-released Drosophila melanogaster,21708160,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.05.013,"Molecular genetic markers can be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for thermal resistance and this has allowed characterization of a major QTL for knockdown resistance to high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster. The QTL showed trade-off associations with cold resistance under laboratory conditions. However, assays of thermal tolerance conducted in the laboratory may not necessarily reflect performance at varying temperatures in the field. Here we tested if lines with different genotypes in this QTL show different thermal performance under high and low temperatures in the field using a release recapture assay. We found that lines carrying the QTL genotype for high thermal tolerance were significantly better at locating resources in the field releases under hot temperatures while the QTL line carrying the contrasting genotype were superior at cold temperatures. Further, we studied copulatory success between the different QTL genotypes at different temperatures. We found higher copulatory success in males of the high tolerance QTL genotype under hot temperature conditions, while there was no difference in females at cold temperatures. The results allow relating components of field fitness at different environmental temperatures with genotypic variation in a QTL for thermal tolerance.",2011,"Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Fabian M Norry, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Fabian M Norry"
Rhabdoviruses in two species of Drosophila: vertical transmission and a recent sweep,21339477,10.1534/genetics.111.127696,"Insects are host to a diverse range of vertically transmitted micro-organisms, but while their bacterial symbionts are well-studied, little is known about their vertically transmitted viruses. We have found that two sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae) recently discovered in Drosophila affinis and Drosophila obscura are both vertically transmitted. As is the case for the sigma virus of Drosophila melanogaster, we find that both males and females can transmit these viruses to their offspring. Males transmit lower viral titers through sperm than females transmit through eggs, and a lower proportion of their offspring become infected. In natural populations of D. obscura in the United Kingdom, we found that 39% of flies were infected and that the viral population shows clear evidence of a recent expansion, with extremely low genetic diversity and a large excess of rare polymorphisms. Using sequence data we estimate that the virus has swept across the United Kingdom within the past ??1 years, during which time the viral population size doubled approximately every 9 months. Using simulations based on our lab estimates of transmission rates, we show that the biparental mode of transmission allows the virus to invade and rapidly spread through populations at rates consistent with those measured in the field. Therefore, as predicted by our simulations, the virus has undergone an extremely rapid and recent increase in population size. In light of this and earlier studies of a related virus in D. melanogaster, we conclude that vertically transmitted rhabdoviruses may be common in insects and that these host-parasite interactions can be highly dynamic.",2011,"Ben Longdon, Lena Wilfert, Darren J Obbard, Francis M Jiggins, Ben Longdon, Lena Wilfert, Darren J Obbard, Francis M Jiggins"
Therapeutic targeting of the innate immune system in domestic animals,20953632,10.1007/s00441-010-1054-9,"Since first being described in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the knowledge regarding Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has transformed our understanding of immunology. TLRs are a family of conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognise specific microbial-associated molecular patterns and allow the cell to distinguish between self and non-self materials. The very property of the TLRs, to link innate and adaptive immunity, offers a novel opportunity to develop vaccines that engage TLR signalling. The presence of TLR ligands as adjuvants in conjunction with a vaccine is shown to increase the efficacy and response to the immunisation with a particular antigen. Here, we focus on the findings pertaining to TLR ligands as adjuvants and discuss the importance of these studies in the development of an optimal vaccine in farm and companion animals.",2011,"Tracey J Coffey, Dirk Werling, Tracey J Coffey, Dirk Werling"
"The Comet assay in insects--Status, prospects and benefits for science",27036067,10.1016/j.mrrev.2015.09.001,"The Comet assay has been recently adapted to investigate DNA damage in insects. The first reports of its use in Drosophila melanogaster appeared in 2002. Since then, the interest in the application of the Comet assay to studies of insects has been rapidly increasing. Many authors see substantial potential in the use of the Comet assay in D. melanogaster for medical toxicology studies. This application could allow the testing of drugs and result in an understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxins, which could significantly influence the limited research that has been performed on vertebrates. The possible perspectives and benefits for science are considered in this review. In the last decade, the use of the Comet assay has been described in insects other than D. melanogaster. Specifically, methods to prepare a cell suspension from insect tissues, which is a difficult task, were analyzed and compared in detail. Furthermore, attention was paid to any differences and modifications in the research protocols, such as the buffer composition and electrophoresis conditions. Various scientific fields in addition to toxicological and ecotoxicological research were considered. We expect the Comet assay to be used in environmental risk assessments and to improve our understanding of many important phenomena of insect life, such as metamorphosis, molting, diapause and quiescence. The use of this method to study species that are of key importance to humans, such as pests and beneficial insects, appears to be highly probable and very promising. The use of the Comet assay for DNA stability testing in insects will most likely rapidly increase in the future.",2016,"Maria Augustyniak, Marcin Gladysz, Marta Dziewi?cka, Maria Augustyniak, Marcin Gladysz, Marta Dziewi?cka"
A dataset for assessing temporal changes in gene expression during the aging process of adult Drosophila melanogaster,27252981,10.1016/j.dib.2016.04.072,"A Drosophila melanogaster genome-wide transcriptome dataset is available for studies on temporal patterns of gene expression. Gene expression was measured using two-dye color oligonucleotide arrays derived from Version 2 of the Drosophila Genomics Resource Center. A total of 15,158 oligonucleotide probes corresponded to a high proportion of the coding genes in the genome. The source of the flies was a highly genetically heterogeneous population maintained in an overlapping generation population regime. This regime was designed to maintain life history traits so that they were similar to those found in natural populations. Flies collected for the cohorts were obtained in a short period of time in a carefully controlled manner before virgin females and males were allowed to mate. Mated females were introduced into two large population cages in unusually high numbers (approximately 12,000 per cage) for a Drosophila laboratory longevity study. Samples were taken weekly from each cohort for 11 weeks; only a small proportion of surviving flies were present at the last two collection time points and thus they were exceptionally old compared to those collected in early-to-midlife samples. The data set is useful for studies of temporal patterns of gene expression as flies age. The very large size of each cohort, and relatively frequent incidence of temporal samples, allows for a fine-scale study of gene expression from young to very old flies.",2016,"Kimberly A Carlson, Chi Zhang, Lawrence G Harshman, Kimberly A Carlson, Chi Zhang, Lawrence G Harshman"
Repeated Duplication of Argonaute2 Is Associated with Strong Selection and Testis Specialization in Drosophila,27535930,10.1534/genetics.116.192336,"Argonaute2 (Ago2) is a rapidly evolving nuclease in the Drosophila melanogaster RNA interference (RNAi) pathway that targets viruses and transposable elements in somatic tissues. Here we reconstruct the history of Ago2 duplications across the D. obscura group and use patterns of gene expression to infer new functional specialization. We show that some duplications are old, shared by the entire species group, and that losses may be common, including previously undetected losses in the lineage leading to D. pseudoobscura We find that while the original (syntenic) gene copy has generally retained the ancestral ubiquitous expression pattern, most of the novel Ago2 paralogs have independently specialized to testis-specific expression. Using population genetic analyses, we show that most testis-specific paralogs have significantly lower genetic diversity than the genome-wide average. This suggests recent positive selection in three different species, and model-based analyses provide strong evidence of recent hard selective sweeps in or near four of the six D. pseudoobscura Ago2 paralogs. We speculate that the repeated evolution of testis specificity in obscura group Ago2 genes, combined with their dynamic turnover and strong signatures of adaptive evolution, may be associated with highly derived roles in the suppression of transposable elements or meiotic drive. Our study highlights the lability of RNAi pathways, even within well-studied groups such as Drosophila, and suggests that strong selection may act quickly after duplication in RNAi pathways, potentially giving rise to new and unknown RNAi functions in nonmodel species.",2016,"Samuel H Lewis, Claire L Webster, Heli Salmela, Darren J Obbard, Samuel H Lewis, Claire L Webster, Heli Salmela, Darren J Obbard"
The nutritional and hedonic value of food modulate sexual receptivity in Drosophila melanogaster females,26777264,10.1038/srep19441,"Food and sex often go hand in hand because of the nutritional cost of reproduction. For Drosophila melanogaster females, this relationship is especially intimate because their offspring develop on food. Since yeast and sugars are important nutritional pillars for Drosophila, availability of these foods should inform female reproductive behaviours. Yet mechanisms coupling food and sex are poorly understood. Here we show that yeast increases female sexual receptivity through interaction between its protein content and its odorous fermentation product acetic acid, sensed by the Ionotropic odorant receptor neuron Ir75a. A similar interaction between nutritional and hedonic value applies to sugars where taste and caloric value only increase sexual receptivity when combined. Integration of nutritional and sensory values would ensure that there are sufficient internal nutrients for egg production as well as sufficient environmental nutrients for offspring survival. These findings provide mechanisms through which females may maximize reproductive output in changing environments.",2016,"Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Jenke A Gorter, Samyukta Jagadeesh, Christoph Gahr, Jelle J Boonekamp, Joel D Levine, Jean-Christophe Billeter"
An evolutionarily conserved mechanism for cAMP elicited axonal regeneration involves direct activation of the dual leucine zipper kinase DLK,27268300,10.7554/eLife.14048,"A broadly known method to stimulate the growth potential of axons is to elevate intracellular levels of cAMP, however the cellular pathway(s) that mediate this are not known. Here we identify the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, Wnd in Drosophila) as a critical target and effector of cAMP in injured axons. DLK/Wnd is thought to function as an injury 'sensor', as it becomes activated after axonal damage. Our findings in both Drosophila and mammalian neurons indicate that the cAMP effector kinase PKA is a conserved and direct upstream activator of Wnd/DLK. PKA is required for the induction of Wnd signaling in injured axons, and DLK is essential for the regenerative effects of cAMP in mammalian DRG neurons. These findings link two important mediators of responses to axonal injury, DLK/Wnd and cAMP/PKA, into a unified and evolutionarily conserved molecular pathway for stimulating the regenerative potential of injured axons.",2016,"Yan Hao, Erin Frey, Choya Yoon, Hetty Wong, Douglas Nestorovski, Lawrence B Holzman, Roman J Giger, Aaron DiAntonio, Catherine Collins, Yan Hao, Erin Frey, Choya Yoon, Hetty Wong, Douglas Nestorovski, Lawrence B Holzman, Roman J Giger, Aaron DiAntonio, Catherine Collins"

Drosophila Mitf regulates the V-ATPase and the lysosomal-autophagic pathway,26761346,10.1080/15548627.2015.1134081,"An evolutionarily conserved gene network regulates the expression of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis, autophagy, and lipid metabolism. In mammals, TFEB and other members of the MiTF-TFE family of transcription factors control this network. Here we report that the lysosomal-autophagy pathway is controlled by Mitf gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Mitf is the single MiTF-TFE family member in Drosophila and prior to this work was known only for its function in eye development. We show that Mitf regulates the expression of genes encoding V-ATPase subunits as well as many additional genes involved in the lysosomal-autophagy pathway. Reduction of Mitf function leads to abnormal lysosomes and impairs autophagosome fusion and lipid breakdown during the response to starvation. In contrast, elevated Mitf levels increase the number of lysosomes, autophagosomes and autolysosomes, and decrease the size of lipid droplets. Inhibition of Drosophila MTORC1 induces Mitf translocation to the nucleus, underscoring conserved regulatory mechanisms between Drosophila and mammalian systems. Furthermore, we show Mitf-mediated clearance of cytosolic and nuclear expanded ATXN1 (ataxin 1) in a cellular model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). This remarkable observation illustrates the potential of the lysosomal-autophagy system to prevent toxic protein aggregation in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. We anticipate that the genetics of the Drosophila model and the absence of redundant MIT transcription factors will be exploited to investigate the regulation and function of the lysosomal-autophagy gene network.",2016,"Valentina BouchÃ©, Alma Perez Espinosa, Luigi Leone, Marco Sardiello, Andrea Ballabio, Juan Botas, Valentina BouchÃ©, Alma Perez Espinosa, Luigi Leone, Marco Sardiello, Andrea Ballabio, Juan Botas"
Expansion of GA Dinucleotide Repeats Increases the Density of CLAMP Binding Sites on the X-Chromosome to Promote Drosophila Dosage Compensation,27414415,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006120,"Dosage compensation is an essential process that equalizes transcript levels of X-linked genes between sexes by forming a domain of coordinated gene expression. Throughout the evolution of Diptera, many different X-chromosomes acquired the ability to be dosage compensated. Once each newly evolved X-chromosome is targeted for dosage compensation in XY males, its active genes are upregulated two-fold to equalize gene expression with XX females. In Drosophila melanogaster, the CLAMP zinc finger protein links the dosage compensation complex to the X-chromosome. However, the mechanism for X-chromosome identification has remained unknown. Here, we combine biochemical, genomic and evolutionary approaches to reveal that expansion of GA-dinucleotide repeats likely accumulated on the X-chromosome over evolutionary time to increase the density of CLAMP binding sites, thereby driving the evolution of dosage compensation.

The migrations of Drosophila muscle founders and primordial germ cells are interdependent,27578182,10.1242/dev.134346,"Caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM) cells migrate from posterior to anterior of the Drosophila embryo as two bilateral streams of cells to support the specification of longitudinal muscles along the midgut. To accomplish this long-distance migration, CVM cells receive input from their environment, but little is known about how this collective cell migration is regulated. In a screen we found that wunen mutants exhibit CVM cell migration defects. Wunens are lipid phosphate phosphatases known to regulate the directional migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs). PGC and CVM cell types interact while PGCs are en route to the somatic gonadal mesoderm, and previous studies have shown that CVM impacts PGC migration. In turn, we found here that CVM cells exhibit an affinity for PGCs, localizing to the position of PGCs whether mislocalized or trapped in the endoderm. In the absence of PGCs, CVM cells exhibit subtle changes, including more cohesive movement of the migrating collective, and an increased number of longitudinal muscles is found at anterior sections of the larval midgut.

An RNAi Screen To Identify Protein Phosphatases That Function Within the Drosophila Circadian Clock,27784754,10.1534/g3.116.035345,"Circadian clocks in eukaryotes keep time via cell-autonomous transcriptional feedback loops. A well-characterized example of such a transcriptional feedback loop is in Drosophila, where CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) complexes activate transcription of period (per) and timeless (tim) genes, rising levels of PER-TIM complexes feed-back to repress CLK-CYC activity, and degradation of PER and TIM permits the next cycle of CLK-CYC transcription. The timing of CLK-CYC activation and PER-TIM repression is regulated posttranslationally, in part through rhythmic phosphorylation of CLK, PER, and TIM. Previous behavioral screens identified several kinases that control CLK, PER, and TIM levels, subcellular localization, and/or activity, but two phosphatases that function within the clock were identified through the analysis of candidate genes from other pathways or model systems. To identify phosphatases that play a role in the clock, we screened clock cell-specific RNA interference (RNAi) knockdowns of all annotated protein phosphatases and protein phosphatase regulators in Drosophila for altered activity rhythms. This screen identified 19 protein phosphatases that lengthened or shortened the circadian period by ?? hr (p ??0.05 compared to controls) or were arrhythmic. Additional RNAi lines, transposon inserts, overexpression, and loss-of-function mutants were tested to independently confirm these RNAi phenotypes. Based on genetic validation and molecular analysis, 15 viable protein phosphatases remain for future studies.

Mapping QTL Contributing to Variation in Posterior Lobe Morphology between Strains of Drosophila melanogaster,27606594,10.1371/journal.pone.0162573,"Closely-related, and otherwise morphologically similar insect species frequently show striking divergence in the shape and/or size of male genital structures, a phenomenon thought to be driven by sexual selection. Comparative interspecific studies can help elucidate the evolutionary forces acting on genital structures to drive this rapid differentiation. However, genetic dissection of sexual trait divergence between species is frequently hampered by the difficulty generating interspecific recombinants. Intraspecific variation can be leveraged to investigate the genetics of rapidly-evolving sexual traits, and here we carry out a genetic analysis of variation in the posterior lobe within D. melanogaster. The lobe is a male-specific process emerging from the genital arch of D. melanogaster and three closely-related species, is essential for copulation, and shows radical divergence in form across species. There is also abundant variation within species in the shape and size of the lobe, and while this variation is considerably more subtle than that seen among species, it nonetheless provides the raw material for QTL mapping. We created an advanced intercross population from a pair of phenotypically-different inbred strains, and after phenotyping and genotyping-by-sequencing the recombinants, mapped several QTL contributing to various measures of lobe morphology. The additional generations of crossing over in our mapping population led to QTL intervals that are smaller than is typical for an F2 mapping design. The intervals we map overlap with a pair of lobe QTL we previously identified in an independent mapping cross, potentially suggesting a level of shared genetic control of trait variation. Our QTL additionally implicate a suite of genes that have been shown to contribute to the development of the posterior lobe. These loci are strong candidates to harbor naturally-segregating sites contributing to phenotypic variation within D. melanogaster, and may also be those contributing to divergence in lobe morphology between species.",2016,"Jennifer L Hackett, Xiaofei Wang, Brittny R Smith, Stuart J Macdonald, Jennifer L Hackett, Xiaofei Wang, Brittny R Smith, Stuart J Macdonald"
Drosophila Embryos as a Model for Wound-Induced Transcriptional Dynamics: Genetic Strategies to Achieve a Localized Wound Response,27274436,10.1089/wound.2014.0544,"While many studies have established a paradigm for tissue repair at the level of cellular remodeling, it is not clear how an organism restricts a response only to the injured region of a damaged tissue. Skin, the largest organ in the human body, is prone to injury, and repair of epidermal tissue represents a medically relevant system to investigate. Significance: Studies in Drosophila melanogaster provide a robust genetic system to identify molecular components that will positively impact repair and healing. The Drosophila skin consists of a single-cell epidermal layer and relies on well-conserved cellular mechanisms to coordinate gene expression during development. Many studies have established that key developmental genes promote a response to epidermal injury, but the balance between activator and inhibitor signals to coordinate a localized response remains unknown. Recent Advances: Discovery of a genetic pathway that promotes the restriction of transcriptional response to damage only in effected regions. Interestingly, genome-wide microarray studies have identified an intersection between gene expression after aseptic injury and activation of the innate immune response. Critical Issues: The use of a transcriptional activation reporter provides an innovative approach to uncover well-conserved components that promote the localization of a response during epidermal injury and may influence other pathological conditions of tissue damage. Future Directions: The work reviewed in this critical review may lead to development of molecular strategies of repair and improved healing after injury or infection.

High-throughput assessment of context-dependent effects of chromatin proteins,27777628,10.1186/s13072-016-0096-y,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chromatin proteins control gene activity in a concerted manner. We developed a high-throughput assay to study the effects of the local chromatin environment on the regulatory activity of a protein of interest. The assay combines a previously reported multiplexing strategy based on barcoded randomly integrated reporters with Gal4-mediated tethering. We applied the assay to Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1a (HP1a), which is mostly known as a repressive protein but has also been linked to transcriptional activation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Recruitment to over 1000 genomic locations revealed that HP1a is a potent repressor able to silence even highly expressing reporter genes. However, the local chromatin context can modulate HP1a function. In pericentromeric regions, HP1a-induced repression was enhanced by twofold. In regions marked by a H3K36me3-rich chromatin signature, HP1a-dependent silencing was significantly decreased. We found no evidence for an activating function of HP1a in our experimental system. Furthermore, we did not observe stable transmission of repression over mitotic divisions after loss of targeted HP1a.

Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor.

Genomic information indicates that invertebrates contain homologous enzymes although their iodide requirements are unknown. The catalytic domain of IYD from Drosophila melanogaster has now been cloned, expressed and characterized to determine the scope of its potential catalytic function as a model for organisms that are not associated with thyroid hormone production. Little discrimination between iodo-, bromo-, and chlorotyrosine was detected. Their affinity for IYD ranges from 0.46 to 0.62 Î¼M (Kd ) and their efficiency of dehalogenation ranges from 2.4 - 9 x 103 M-1 s-1 (kcat /Km ). These values fall within the variations described for IYDs from other organisms for which a physiological function has been confirmed. The relative contribution of three active site residues that coordinate to the amino acid substrates was subsequently determined by mutagenesis of IYD from Drosophila to refine future annotations of genomic and meta-genomic data for dehalogenation of halotyrosines. Substitution of the active site glutamate to glutamine was most detrimental to catalysis. Alternative substitution of an active site lysine to glutamine affected substrate affinity to the greatest extent but only moderately affected catalytic turnover.

Residue-specific annotation of disorder-to-order transition and cathepsin inhibition of a propeptide-like crammer from D. melanogaster,23349821,10.1371/journal.pone.0054187,"Drosophila melanogaster crammer is a novel cathepsin inhibitor involved in long-term memory formation. A molten globule-to-ordered structure transition is required for cathepsin inhibition. This study reports the use of alanine scanning to probe the critical residues in the two hydrophobic cores and the salt bridges of crammer in the context of disorder-to-order transition and cathepsin inhibition. Alanine substitution of the aromatic residues W9, Y12, F16, Y20, Y32, and W53 within the hydrophobic cores, and charged residues E8, R28, R29, and E67 in the salt bridges considerably decrease the ability of crammer to inhibit Drosophila cathepsin B (CTSB). Far-UV circular dichroism (CD), intrinsic fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies show that removing most of the aromatic and charged side-chains substantially reduces thermostability, alters pH-dependent helix formation, and disrupts the molten globule-to-ordered structure transition. Molecular modeling indicates that W53 in the hydrophobic Core 2 is essential for the interaction between crammer and the prosegment binding loop (PBL) of CTSB; the salt bridge between R28 and E67 is critical for the appropriate alignment of the Î±-helix 4 toward the CTSB active cleft. The results of this study show detailed residue-specific dissection of folding transition and functional contributions of the hydrophobic cores and salt bridges in crammer, which have hitherto not been characterized for cathepsin inhibition by propeptide-like cysteine protease inhibitors. Because of the involvements of cathepsin inhibitors in neurodegenerative diseases, these structural insights can serve as a template for further development of therapeutic inhibitors against human cathepsins.",2013,"Tien-Sheng Tseng, Chao-Sheng Cheng, Shang-Te Danny Hsu, Min-Fang Shih, Pei-Lin He, Ping-Chiang Lyu, Tien-Sheng Tseng, Chao-Sheng Cheng, Shang-Te Danny Hsu, Min-Fang Shih, Pei-Lin He, Ping-Chiang Lyu"
[Structural features of chromatin organization of 3C6/C7 interband in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes],23795466,,"This article presents an analysis of the causes of chromatin decompaction of interbands in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. On the example of interband 3C6/C7 of X chromosome, we investigate the ability of different DNA segments from the region to form an interband in a new genetic environment. Site-specific FLP recombination between two transposons with FRT-sites allows introducing the DNA fragments from the inter-band 3C6/C7 into plCon(dv) transposon located in cytologically well-characterized 84F region of chromosome 3 followed by electron microscopic analysis of changes in the region, caused by insertion of the DNA fragments into the transposon. Thus, it has shown that the insertion of DNA fragment 276 bp in length from 3C6/C7 region into the plCon(dv) transposon leads to the formation of a new interband between two thin bands which are represented by material of the transposon. To date, the DNA fragment is minimal known sequence that is necessary and sufficient for interband formation. In addition, the sequence containing three tandemly repeated copies of DNA fragment 0.9 kb including a fragment of 276 bp from the interband 3C6/C7 was integrated in the transposon. The presence of additional copies of the DNA fragment did not change the morphology of the resulting interband. It was shown that sites of hypersensitivity to DNase I persist in interbands formed in the new genetic environment. The data obtained allow us to start analysis of the specific factors (proteins, DNA motifs, etc.) that determine the formation of decompacted chromatin state in sertain interband region and, as a whole, chromometric organization of interphase chromosomes in Drosophila.",2013,"A Iu Konev, A A Makase, D K PokrovskiÄ­, M A Ignat'eva, Iu A Il'ina, L V Kotlovanova, A Iu Konev, A A Makase, D K PokrovskiÄ­, M A Ignat'eva, Iu A Il'ina, L V Kotlovanova"
A pair of centromeric proteins mediates reproductive isolation in Drosophila species,24239514,10.1016/j.devcel.2013.10.001,"Speciation involves the reproductive isolation of natural populations due to the sterility or lethality of their hybrids. However, the molecular basis of hybrid lethality and the evolutionary driving forces that provoke it remain largely elusive. The hybrid male rescue (Hmr) and the lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) genes serve as a model to study speciation in Drosophilids because their interaction causes lethality in male hybrid offspring. Here, we show that HMR and LHR form a centromeric complex necessary for proper chromosome segregation. We find that the Hmr expression level is substantially higher in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Lhr expression levels are increased in Drosophila simulans. The resulting elevated amount of HMR/LHR complex in hybrids results in an extensive mislocalization of the complex, an interference with the regulation of transposable elements, and an impairment of cell proliferation.

Analysis of replication intermediates indicates that Drosophila melanogaster mitochondrial DNA replicates by a strand-coupled theta mechanism,23308172,10.1371/journal.pone.0053249,"Mitochondrial DNA synthesis is necessary for the normal function of the organelle and for the eukaryotic organism as a whole. Here we demonstrate, using two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to analyse replication intermediates, that unidirectional, strand-coupled DNA synthesis is the prevalent mode of mtDNA replication in Drosophila melanogaster. Commencing within the single, extended non-coding region (NCR), replication proceeds around the circular genome, manifesting an irregular rate of elongation, and pausing frequently in specific regions. Evidence for a limited contribution of strand-asynchronous DNA synthesis was found in a subset of mtDNA molecules, but confined to the ribosomal RNA gene region, just downstream of the NCR. Our findings imply that strand-coupled replication is widespread amongst metazoans, and should inform future research on mtDNA metabolism in D. melanogaster.",2013,"Priit JÃµers, Howard T Jacobs, Priit JÃµers, Howard T Jacobs"
Temperature-size rule is mediated by thermal plasticity of critical size in Drosophila melanogaster,23595269,10.1098/rspb.2013.0174,"Most ectotherms show an inverse relationship between developmental temperature and body size, a phenomenon known as the temperature-size rule (TSR). Several competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain its occurrence. According to one set of views, the TSR results from inevitable biophysical effects of temperature on the rates of growth and differentiation, whereas other views suggest the TSR is an adaptation that can be achieved by a diversity of mechanisms in different taxa. Our data reveal that the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, obeys the TSR using a novel mechanism: reduction in critical size at higher temperatures. In holometabolous insects, attainment of critical size initiates the hormonal cascade that terminates growth, and hence, Drosophila larvae appear to instigate the signal to stop growth at a smaller size at higher temperatures. This is in contrast to findings from another holometabolous insect, Manduca sexta, in which the TSR results from the effect of temperature on the rate and duration of growth. This contrast suggests that there is no single mechanism that accounts for the TSR. Instead, the TSR appears to be an adaptation that is achieved at a proximate level through different mechanisms in different taxa.",2013,"Shampa M Ghosh, Nicholas D Testa, Alexander W Shingleton, Shampa M Ghosh, Nicholas D Testa, Alexander W Shingleton"

Functions and Mechanisms of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Signalling in Drosophila melanogaster,23493057,10.3390/ijms14035920,"Intercellular signalling via growth factors plays an important role in controlling cell differentiation and cell movements during the development of multicellular animals. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signalling induces changes in cellular behaviour allowing cells in the embryo to move, to survive, to divide or to differentiate. Several examples argue that FGF signalling is used in multi-step morphogenetic processes to achieve and maintain a transitional state of the cells required for the control of cell fate. In the genetic model Drosophila melanogaster, FGF signalling via the receptor tyrosine kinases Heartless (Htl) and Breathless (Btl) is particularly well studied. These FGF receptors affect gene expression, cell shape and cell-cell interactions during mesoderm layer formation, caudal visceral muscle (CVM) formation, tracheal morphogenesis and glia differentiation.

Inducing extra copies of the Hsp70 gene in Drosophila melanogaster increases energetic demand,23510136,10.1186/1471-2148-13-68,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mutations that increase gene expression are predicted to increase energy allocation to transcription, translation and protein function. Despite an appreciation that energetic tradeoffs may constrain adaptation, the energetic costs of increased gene expression are challenging to quantify and thus easily ignored when modeling the evolution of gene expression, particularly for multicellular organisms. Here we use the well-characterized, inducible heat-shock response to test whether expressing additional copies of the Hsp70 gene increases energetic demand in Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We measured metabolic rates of larvae with different copy numbers of the Hsp70 gene to quantify energy expenditure before, during, and after exposure to 36Â°C, a temperature known to induce robust expression of Hsp70. We observed a rise in metabolic rate within the first 30 minutes of 36Â°C exposure above and beyond the increase in routine metabolic rate at 36Â°C. The magnitude of this increase in metabolic rate was positively correlated with Hsp70 gene copy number and reflected an increase as great as 35% of the 22Â°C metabolic rate. Gene copy number also affected Hsp70 mRNA levels as early as 15 minutes after larvae were placed at 36Â°C, demonstrating that gene copy number affects transcript abundance on the same timescale as the metabolic effects that we observed. Inducing Hsp70 also had lasting physiological costs, as larvae had significantly depressed metabolic rate when returned to 22Â°C after induction.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results demonstrate both immediate and persistent energetic consequences of gene copy number in a multicellular organism. We discuss these consequences in the context of existing literature on the pleiotropic effects of variation in Hsp70 copy number, and argue that the increased energetic demand of expressing extra copies of Hsp70 may contribute to known tradeoffs in physiological performance of extra-copy larvae. Physiological costs of mutations that greatly increase gene expression, such as these, may constrain their utility for adaptive evolution.",2013,"Luke A Hoekstra, Kristi L Montooth, Luke A Hoekstra, Kristi L Montooth"
QTL for survival to UV-C radiation in Drosophila melanogaster,22788381,10.3109/09553002.2012.711503,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      The aim of this study was to investigate tolerance to UV-C (ultraviolet C, 280-100 nm) radiation in Drosophila melanogaster, implementing a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach. This is of interest to test for genetic variation in survival to UV (ultraviolet) radiation.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      We performed a QTL scan in D. melanogaster recombinant inbred lines (RIL) constructed from parental stocks derived from a crossing between northern and southern hemisphere populations that segregated substantial genetic variation in thermal resistance in a previous study. Here, two experimental treatments were implemented: Continuous and cyclic UV-C radiation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Significant QTL were detected on all three major chromosomes. Among these, multiple trait composite interval mapping revealed a significant QTL in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 2, a genome region consistently implicated in thermotolerance in previous studies.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      This study shows substantial genetic variation for UV-C radiation resistance in D. melanogaster, with QTL for survival to UV-C radiation generally overlapping with major thermotolerance QTL. The genetic architecture of UV-C radiation resistance appears to be more complex in continuously irradiated individuals.",2013,"Federico H Gomez, Volker Loeschcke, Fabian M Norry, Federico H Gomez, Volker Loeschcke, Fabian M Norry"
Neurodegeneration in drop-dead mutant drosophila melanogaster is associated with the respiratory system but not with Hypoxia,23874488,10.1371/journal.pone.0068032,"Mutations in the gene drop-dead (drd) cause diverse phenotypes in adult Drosophila melanogaster including early lethality, neurodegeneration, tracheal defects, gut dysfunction, reduced body mass, and female sterility. Despite the identification of the drd gene itself, the causes of early lethality and neurodegeneration in the mutant flies remain unknown. To determine the pattern of drd expression associated with the neurodegenerative phenotype, knockdown of drd with various Gal4 drivers was performed. Early adult lethality and neurodegeneration were observed upon knockdown of drd in the tracheal system with two independent insertions of the breathless-Gal4 driver and upon knockdown in the tracheal system and elsewhere with the DJ717-Gal4 driver. Surprisingly, rescue of drd expression exclusively in the tracheae in otherwise mutant flies rescued the neurodegenerative phenotype but not adult lethality. Gut dysfunction, as measured by defecation rate, was not rescued in these flies, and gut function appeared normal upon tracheal-specific knockdown of drd. Finally, the hypothesis that tracheal dysfunction in drd mutants results in hypoxia was tested. Hypoxia-sensitive reporter transgenes (LDH-Gal4 and LDH-LacZ) were placed on a drd mutant background, but enhanced expression of these reporters was not observed. In addition, manipulation of drd expression in the tracheae did not affect expression of the hypoxia-induced genes LDH, tango, and similar. Overall, these results indicate that there are at least two causes of adult lethality in drd mutants, that gut dysfunction and neurodegeneration are independent phenotypes, and that neurodegeneration is associated with tracheal expression of drd but not with hypoxia.",2013,"Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal, Christine Lynn Sansone, Edward M Blumenthal"

Compound chromosomes, rearrangements in which homologous chromosome arms share a centromere, have proven especially useful in genetic-based surveys of the entire genome.

Here we describe two strategies, cold-shock and use of the bubR1 mutant alleles, to produce nullo gametes through nondisjunction. These gametes are complementary to the compound chromosome-bearing gametes and thus produce viable progeny.

Two types of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in Drosophila and other arthropods,23604020,10.1007/s00018-013-1334-0,"Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) play a central role in the mammalian nervous system. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are activated by the agonists acetylcholine and muscarine, and blocked by a variety of antagonists. Mammals have five mAChRs (m1-m5). In this study, we cloned two structurally related GPCRs from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which, after expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, proved to be muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. One mAChR (the A-type; encoded by gene CG4356) is activated by acetylcholine (EC50, 5 ? 10(-8) M) and muscarine (EC50, 6 ? 10(-8) M) and blocked by the classical mAChR antagonists atropine, scopolamine, and 3-quinuclidinyl-benzilate (QNB), while the other (the B-type; encoded by gene CG7918) is also activated by acetylcholine, but has a 1,000-fold lower sensitivity to muscarine, and is not blocked by the antagonists. A- and B-type mAChRs were also cloned and functionally characterized from the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Recently, Haga et al. (Nature 2012, 482: 547-551) published the crystal structure of the human m2 mAChR, revealing 14 amino acid residues forming the binding pocket for QNB. These residues are identical between the human m2 and the D. melanogaster and T. castaneum A-type mAChRs, while many of them are different between the human m2 and the B-type receptors. Using bioinformatics, one orthologue of the A-type and one of the B-type mAChRs could also be found in all other arthropods with a sequenced genome. Protostomes, such as arthropods, and deuterostomes, such as mammals and other vertebrates, belong to two evolutionarily distinct lineages of animal evolution that split about 700 million years ago. We found that animals that originated before this split, such as cnidarians (Hydra), had two A-type mAChRs.

Genetic composition of social groups influences male aggressive behaviour and fitness in natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster,24068359,10.1098/rspb.2013.1926,"Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe how an individual's behaviour-which is influenced by his or her genotype-can affect the behaviours of interacting individuals. IGE research has focused on dyads. However, insights from social networks research, and other studies of group behaviour, suggest that dyadic interactions are affected by the behaviour of other individuals in the group. To extend IGE inferences to groups of three or more, IGEs must be considered from a group perspective. Here, I introduce the 'focal interaction' approach to study IGEs in groups. I illustrate the utility of this approach by studying aggression among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. I chose two natural genotypes as 'focal interactants': the behavioural interaction between them was the 'focal interaction'. One male from each focal interactant genotype was present in every group, and I varied the genotype of the third male-the 'treatment male'. Genetic variation in the treatment male's aggressive behaviour influenced the focal interaction, demonstrating that IGEs in groups are not a straightforward extension of IGEs measured in dyads. Further, the focal interaction influenced male mating success, illustrating the role of IGEs in behavioural evolution. These results represent the first manipulative evidence for IGEs at the group level.",2013,"Julia B Saltz, Julia B Saltz"
Formin-mediated actin polymerization cooperates with Mushroom body defect (Mud)-Dynein during Frizzled-Dishevelled spindle orientation,23868974,10.1242/jcs.129544,"To position the mitotic spindle, cytoskeletal components must be coordinated to generate cortical forces on astral microtubules. Although the dynein motor is common to many spindle orientation systems, 'accessory pathways' are often also required. In this work, we identified an accessory spindle orientation pathway in Drosophila that functions with Dynein during planar cell polarity, downstream of the Frizzled (Fz) effector Dishevelled (Dsh). Dsh contains a PDZ ligand and a Dynein-recruiting DEP domain that are both required for spindle orientation. The Dsh PDZ ligand recruits Canoe/Afadin and ultimately leads to Rho GTPase signaling mediated through RhoGEF2. The formin Diaphanous (Dia) functions as the Rho effector in this pathway, inducing F-actin enrichment at sites of cortical Dsh. Chimeric protein experiments show that the Dia-actin accessory pathway can be replaced by an independent kinesin (Khc73) accessory pathway for Dsh-mediated spindle orientation.

As we have already shown, this is indicative of the decrease in the concentration of the above hormones. It was also found that the total inactivation of InR does not affect the initiation ofJ H and DA metabolic system response to heat stress; however, it does affect its intensity.

Gprk2 adjusts Fog signaling to organize cell movements in Drosophila gastrulation,24026125,10.1242/dev.093625,"Gastrulation of Drosophila melanogaster proceeds through sequential cell movements: ventral mesodermal (VM) cells are induced by secreted Fog protein to constrict their apical surfaces to form the ventral furrow, and subsequently lateral mesodermal (LM) cells involute toward the furrow. How these cell movements are organized remains elusive. Here, we observed that LM cells extended apical protrusions and then underwent accelerated involution movement, confirming that VM and LM cells display distinct cell morphologies and movements. In a mutant for the GPCR kinase Gprk2, apical constriction was expanded to all mesodermal cells and the involution movement was abolished. In addition, the mesodermal cells halted apical constriction prematurely in accordance with the aberrant accumulation of Myosin II. Epistasis analyses revealed that the Gprk2 mutant phenotypes were dependent on the fog gene. Overexpression of Gprk2 suppressed the effects of excess Cta, a downstream component of Fog signaling. Based on these findings, we propose that Gprk2 attenuates and tunes Fog-Cta signaling to prevent apical constriction in LM cells and to support appropriate apical constriction in VM cells. Thus, the two distinct cell movements in mesoderm invagination are not predetermined, but rather are organized by the adjustment of cell signaling.",2013,"Naoyuki Fuse, Fengwei Yu, Susumu Hirose, Naoyuki Fuse, Fengwei Yu, Susumu Hirose"
HIF- and non-HIF-regulated hypoxic responses require the estrogen-related receptor in Drosophila melanogaster,23382692,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003230,"Low-oxygen tolerance is supported by an adaptive response that includes a coordinate shift in metabolism and the activation of a transcriptional program that is driven by the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. The precise contribution of HIF-1a in the adaptive response, however, has not been determined. Here, we investigate how HIF influences hypoxic adaptation throughout Drosophila melanogaster development. We find that hypoxic-induced transcriptional changes are comprised of HIF-dependent and HIF-independent pathways that are distinct and separable. We show that normoxic set-points of carbohydrate metabolites are significantly altered in sima mutants and that these animals are unable to mobilize glycogen in hypoxia. Furthermore, we find that the estrogen-related receptor (dERR), which is a global regulator of aerobic glycolysis in larvae, is required for a competent hypoxic response. dERR binds to dHIFa and participates in the HIF-dependent transcriptional program in hypoxia. In addition, dERR acts in the absence of dHIFa in hypoxia and a significant portion of HIF-independent transcriptional responses can be attributed to dERR actions, including upregulation of glycolytic transcripts. These results indicate that competent hypoxic responses arise from complex interactions between HIF-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that dERR plays a central role in both of these programs.",2013,"Yan Li, Divya Padmanabha, Luciana B Gentile, Catherine I Dumur, Robert B Beckstead, Keith D Baker, Yan Li, Divya Padmanabha, Luciana B Gentile, Catherine I Dumur, Robert B Beckstead, Keith D Baker"
Variation in meiotic recombination frequencies between allelic transgenes inserted at different sites in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,23797104,10.1534/g3.113.006411,"Meiotic crossovers are distributed nonrandomly across the genome. Classic studies in Drosophila suggest that the position of a gene along a chromosome arm can affect the outcome of the recombination process, with proximity to the centromere being associated with lower crossing over. To examine this phenomenon molecularly, we developed an assay that measures meiotic crossovers and noncrossover gene conversions between allelic transgenes inserted into different genomic positions. To facilitate collecting a large number of virgin females, we developed a useful genetic system that kills males and undesired classes of females. We found that the recombination frequency at a site in the middle of the X chromosome, where crossovers are normally frequent, was similar to the frequency at the centromere-proximal end of the euchromatin, where crossovers are normally infrequent. In contrast, we recovered no recombinants--crossovers or noncrossovers--at a site on chromosome 4 and at a site toward the distal end of the X chromosome.

Optogenetic stimulation of escape behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,23380919,10.3791/50192,"A growing number of genetically encoded tools are becoming available that allow non-invasive manipulation of the neural activity of specific neurons in Drosophila melanogaster. Chief among these are optogenetic tools, which enable the activation or silencing of specific neurons in the intact and freely moving animal using bright light. Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) is a light-activated cation channel that, when activated by blue light, causes depolarization of neurons that express it. ChR2 has been effective for identifying neurons critical for specific behaviors, such as CO(2) avoidance, proboscis extension and giant-fiber mediated startle response. However, as the intense light sources used to stimulate ChR2 also stimulate photoreceptors, these optogenetic techniques have not previously been used in the visual system. Here, we combine an optogenetic approach with a mutation that impairs phototransduction to demonstrate that activation of a cluster of loom-sensitive neurons in the fly's optic lobe, Foma-1 neurons, can drive an escape behavior used to avoid collision. We used a null allele of a critical component of the phototransduction cascade, phospholipase C-Î², encoded by the norpA gene, to render the flies blind and also use the Gal4-UAS transcriptional activator system to drive expression of ChR2 in the Foma-1 neurons. Individual flies are placed on a small platform surrounded by blue LEDs. When the LEDs are illuminated, the flies quickly take-off into flight, in a manner similar to visually driven loom-escape behavior. We believe that this technique can be easily adapted to examine other behaviors in freely moving flies.",2013,"Saskia E J de Vries, Tom Clandinin, Saskia E J de Vries, Tom Clandinin"
Myc-driven overgrowth requires unfolded protein response-mediated induction of autophagy and antioxidant responses in Drosophila melanogaster,23950728,10.1371/journal.pgen.1003664,"Autophagy, a lysosomal self-degradation and recycling pathway, plays dual roles in tumorigenesis. Autophagy deficiency predisposes to cancer, at least in part, through accumulation of the selective autophagy cargo p62, leading to activation of antioxidant responses and tumor formation. While cell growth and autophagy are inversely regulated in most cells, elevated levels of autophagy are observed in many established tumors, presumably mediating survival of cancer cells. Still, the relationship of autophagy and oncogenic signaling is poorly characterized. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor Myc (dm), a proto-oncogene involved in cell growth and proliferation, is also a physiological regulator of autophagy in Drosophila melanogaster. Loss of Myc activity in null mutants or in somatic clones of cells inhibits autophagy. Forced expression of Myc results in cell-autonomous increases in cell growth, autophagy induction, and p62 (Ref2P)-mediated activation of Nrf2 (cnc), a transcription factor promoting antioxidant responses. Mechanistically, Myc overexpression increases unfolded protein response (UPR), which leads to PERK-dependent autophagy induction and may be responsible for p62 accumulation. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of UPR, autophagy or p62/Nrf2 signaling prevents Myc-induced overgrowth, while these pathways are dispensable for proper growth of control cells. In addition, we show that the autophagy and antioxidant pathways are required in parallel for excess cell growth driven by Myc. Deregulated expression of Myc drives tumor progression in most human cancers, and UPR and autophagy have been implicated in the survival of Myc-dependent cancer cells. Our data obtained in a complete animal show that UPR, autophagy and p62/Nrf2 signaling are required for Myc-dependent cell growth. These novel results give additional support for finding future approaches to specifically inhibit the growth of cancer cells addicted to oncogenic Myc.",2013,"PÃ©ter Nagy, Agnes Varga, Karolina Pircs, Krisztina HegedÅ±s, GÃ¡bor JuhÃ¡sz, PÃ©ter Nagy, Agnes Varga, Karolina Pircs, Krisztina HegedÅ±s, GÃ¡bor JuhÃ¡sz"
Food deprivation increases the low-dose locomotor stimulant response to ethanol in Drosophila melanogaster,23994621,10.1016/j.pbb.2013.08.010,"Acute and chronic states of food deprivation result in increased sensitivity to a variety of natural reinforcers as well as to drugs of abuse. Food deprived animals show increased locomotor activity during periods of food deprivation, as well as increased locomotor stimulant responses to drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, and ethanol, implying that drugs of abuse act in part on neural systems that underlie responses towards food. To determine whether this effect extends to an invertebrate, highly genetically tractable animal, the locomotor stimulant effects of low dose ethanol were assessed under a variety of feeding conditions in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Food deprivation resulted in strain specific increases in ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity in most strains tested, although elevated baseline activity confounded interpretation in some strains. Experiments conducted with Canton S flies found that the effects of food deprivation on the locomotor stimulant response to ethanol increased with the duration of deprivation, and could be blocked by refeeding the flies with standard food or sucrose, but not yeast, immediately prior to the ethanol exposure. Life-span extending dietary depletion procedures or previous periods of food deprivation did not affect the response to ethanol, indicating that only animals in an acutely food deprived state are more sensitive to the stimulant effects of ethanol. These results suggest that increased sensitivity to the stimulant effects of some drugs of abuse might reflect an evolutionarily conserved neural mechanism that underlies behavioral responses to natural reinforcers and drugs of abuse. The identification of this mechanism, and the genes that underlie its development and function, will constitute a novel approach towards the study of alcohol abuse and dependence.",2013,"Christopher L Kliethermes, Christopher L Kliethermes"

The P-element insertion disrupts an ecdysone-regulated transcript which, although expressed during embryonic and larval stages, appears critical for preparing the late prepupal response to ecdysone. By a combination of molecular and genetic studies, in which we recovered new alleles, we show that the locus is complex, containing at least two distinct promoters. Its transcripts contain a short region described previously by R. SchÃ¼h et al. (1986, Cell 47, 1025-1032), who screened for homologues of the KrÃ¼ppel gene.

"MAML1, a human homologue of Drosophila mastermind, is a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH receptors",11101851,10.1038/82644,"Notch receptors are involved in cell-fate determination in organisms as diverse as flies, frogs and humans. In Drosophila melanogaster , loss-of-function mutations of Notch produce a 'neurogenic' phenotype in which cells destined to become epidermis switch fate and differentiate to neural cells. Upon ligand activation, the intracellular domain of Notch (ICN) translocates to the nucleus, and interacts directly with the DNA-binding protein Suppressor of hairless (Su(H)) in flies, or recombination signal binding protein Jkappa (RBP-Jkappa) in mammals, to activate gene transcription. But the precise mechanisms of Notch-induced gene expression are not completely understood. The gene mastermind has been identified in multiple genetic screens for modifiers of Notch mutations in Drosophila. Here we clone MAML1, a human homologue of the Drosophila gene Mastermind, and show that it encodes a protein of 130 kD localizing to nuclear bodies. MAML1 binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of all four mammalian NOTCH receptors, forms a DNA-binding complex with ICN and RBP-Jkappa, and amplifies NOTCH-induced transcription of HES1. These studies provide a molecular mechanism to explain the genetic links between mastermind and Notch in Drosophila and indicate that MAML1 functions as a transcriptional co-activator for NOTCH signalling.",2000,"L Wu, J C Aster, S C Blacklow, R Lake, S Artavanis-Tsakonas, J D Griffin, L Wu, J C Aster, S C Blacklow, R Lake, S Artavanis-Tsakonas, J D Griffin"

Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding a drosophila ryanodine receptor and functional studies of the carboxyl-terminal calcium release channel,10692315,10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76683-5,"Ryanodine is a plant alkaloid that was originally used as an insecticide. To study the function and regulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) from insect cells, we have cloned the entire cDNA sequence of RyR from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The primary sequence of the Drosophila RyR contains 5134 amino acids, which shares approximately 45% identity with RyRs from mammalian cells, with a large cytoplasmic domain at the amino-terminal end and a small transmembrane domain at the carboxyl-terminal end. To characterize the Ca(2+) release channel activity of the cloned Drosophila RyR, we expressed both full-length and a deletion mutant of Drosophila RyR lacking amino acids 277-3650 (Drosophila RyR-C) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. For subcellular localization of the expressed Drosophila RyR and Drosophila RyR-C proteins, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Drosophila RyR and GFP-Drosophila RyR-C fusion constructs were generated. Confocal microscopic imaging identified GFP-Drosophila RyR and GFP-Drosophila RyR-C on the endoplasmic reticulum membranes of transfected cells. Upon reconstitution into the lipid bilayer membrane, Drosophila RyR-C formed a large conductance cation-selective channel, which was sensitive to modulation by ryanodine. Opening of the Drosophila RyR-C channel required the presence of microM concentration of Ca(2+) in the cytosolic solution, but the channel was insensitive to inhibition by Ca(2+) at concentrations as high as 20 mM. Our data are consistent with our previous observation with the mammalian RyR that the conduction pore of the calcium release channel resides within the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein and further demonstrate that structural and functional features are essentially shared by mammalian and insect RyRs.",2000,"X Xu, M B Bhat, M Nishi, H Takeshima, J Ma, X Xu, M B Bhat, M Nishi, H Takeshima, J Ma"

As new sequence data emerge, it is increasingly clear that OR primary structure can vary dramatically across phyla. Some chemoreceptors are encoded by genes with little sequence similarity to the prototypical ORs originally isolated in mammals.

For instance, the sensitivity for coding exons predicted with both ends correct grows from 62% to 70% on a high-quality test set, when matches to proteins, cDNAs, repeats, and transposons are included. The specificity drops more than the sensitivity increases when ESTs are used.

Latitudinal variation for two enzyme loci and an inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster from Central and South America,10937196,,"Many organisms show latitudinal variation for various genetically determined traits. Such clines may involve neutral variation and originate from historical events or their maintenance may be explained by selection. For Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation for allozymes, inversions, and quantitative traits has been found on several continents. We sampled D. melanogaster populations in Panama and along a transect of 40 latitudinal degrees on the west coast of South America. Negative correlations with latitude were found for AdhS and alpha GpdhF allele frequencies and for the frequency of the cosmopolitan inversion In(2L)t in AdhS alpha GpdhF chromosomes. A positive correlation existed between wing length and latitude. Significant correlations were found between these traits and climatic variables like temperature and rainfall. The observed clines show considerable resemblance to those found on other continents. Gametic disequilibrium between AdhS and alpha GpdhF occurred predominantly at higher latitudes and was caused by the presence of In(2L)t. The reasons for the clinal distributions are discussed and it is argued that selection is the most likely explanation. However, the exact nature of the selective force and the interactions of allozymes with each other and with In(2L)t are complex and not fully understood.

Both azide and azidoalanine were toxic to the injected males, but azidoalanine was significantly less toxic than sodium azide. Following the injection with 0.2 microl of these compounds in the hemocoel of young adult wild-type males, the minimum concentrations of these compounds with complete toxic effects (zero survival) were 40 mM sodium azide and 160 mM azidoalanine. Sex-linked recessive lethals were scored by the Muller-5 method in three successive broods, representing sperms (brood A), spermatids (brood B), and a compiled group of meiotic and premeiotic germ cell stages (brood C). The results provide strong experimental evidence that azidoalanine is significantly (p<0.01) mutagenic to all stages of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Sodium azide, however, was not significantly (p>0.05) mutagenic and did not increase the rate of sex-linked recessive lethals over those produced by the control group injected with 0.45% NaCl.

"Pancreatic eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha kinase (PEK) homologues in humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans that mediate translational control in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress",10677345,,"In response to different cellular stresses, a family of protein kinases regulates translation by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2alpha). Recently, we identified a new family member, pancreatic eIF-2alpha kinase (PEK) from rat pancreas. PEK, also referred to as RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) is a transmembrane protein implicated in translational control in response to stresses that impair protein folding in the ER. In this study, we identified and characterized PEK homologues from humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of human PEK mRNA was found in over 50 different tissues examined, with highest levels in secretory tissues. In mammalian cells subjected to ER stress, we found that elevated eIF-2alpha phosphorylation was coincident with increased PEK autophosphorylation and eIF-2alpha kinase activity. Activation of PEK was abolished by deletion of PEK N-terminal sequences located in the ER lumen. To address the role of C. elegans PEK in translational control, we expressed this kinase in yeast and found that it inhibits growth by hyperphosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and inhibition of eIF-2B. Furthermore, we found that vaccinia virus K3L protein, an inhibitor of the eIF-2alpha kinase PKR involved in an anti-viral defence pathway, also reduced PEK activity. These results suggest that decreased translation initiation by PEK during ER stress may provide the cell with an opportunity to remedy the folding problem prior to introducing newly synthesized proteins into the secretory pathway.",2000,"R Sood, A C Porter, K Ma, L A Quilliam, R C Wek, R Sood, A C Porter, K Ma, L A Quilliam, R C Wek"

Body size variation was created experimentally by varying the degree of crowding (starvation) among larvae from an inbred strain, keeping the genetics and temperature as constant as possible. Hence, in contrast to most previous studies, where genetic and environmental variation have been confounded, we aimed at investigating how much pure phenotypic variation could influence copulation duration and early fecundity. It is shown that copulation duration and fecundity both strongly dependent on female body size, but either not or much less so on male body size. Small females mate faster than medium or large females and small females have the lowest fecundity. Among males, medium-size males are more fecund than smaller or larger males, resulting in stabilising selection for intermediate male size.

When immigrants were outbred, the mean frequency of the immigrant allele was significantly higher than its initial frequency, in both the first and second generations after immigration. There was no significant change in allele frequency for populations receiving inbred immigrants. The increase in allele frequency for outbred immigrants was attributed to an initial outbred vigour fitness advantage of immigrant males over resident males experiencing inbreeding depression. Hybrid vigour of immigrant progeny and the rare-male effect did not have a statistically significant role in the fitness advantage of the immigrant allele.

Regulation of proboscipedia in Drosophila by homeotic selector genes,10978284,,"The gene proboscipedia (pb) is a member of the Antennapedia complex in Drosophila and is required for the proper specification of the adult mouthparts. In the embryo, pb expression serves no known function despite having an accumulation pattern in the mouthpart anlagen that is conserved across several insect orders. We have identified several of the genes necessary to generate this embryonic pattern of expression. These genes can be roughly split into three categories based on their time of action during development. First, prior to the expression of pb, the gap genes are required to specify the domains where pb may be expressed. Second, the initial expression pattern of pb is controlled by the combined action of the genes Deformed (Dfd), Sex combs reduced (Scr), cap'n'collar (cnc), and teashirt (tsh). Lastly, maintenance of this expression pattern later in development is dependent on the action of a subset of the Polycomb group genes. These interactions are mediated in part through a 500-bp regulatory element in the second intron of pb. We further show that Dfd protein binds in vitro to sequences found in this fragment. This is the first clear demonstration of autonomous positive cross-regulation of one Hox gene by another in Drosophila melanogaster and the binding of Dfd to a cis-acting regulatory element indicates that this control might be direct.",2000,"D B Rusch, T C Kaufman, D B Rusch, T C Kaufman"

It is possible that in these females heterospecific courtship songs play a role as if they were conspecific. In contrast, the females of D. sechellia mated with D. melanogaster or D. simulans males in the no-song condition more often than in the song-present condition, suggesting that they reject males with heterospecific song.

However, progenitors of this imaginal visceral musculature have never been detected prior to differentiation. Here I present results indicating that the longitudinal visceral musculature of the midgut completely persists through metamorphosis. Single cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker were transplanted at the blastoderm stage. All clones contributing to the longitudinal visceral musculature detected in third instar larvae were recovered after metamorphosis in adult flies. Further evidence for the persistence of the larval visceral musculature was obtained from the P[Gal4] insertion line 5053A. It expresses GAL4 specifically in the longitudinal visceral muscles of the midgut of all developmental stages to the adult fly beginning at the end of embryogenesis. By using GFP as a reporter, it was possible to follow these cells through the entire metamorphosis.

We isolated doublesex (dsx), which is a downstream step in the cascade, from the phorid fly Megaselia scalaris, which is a distant relative of D. melanogaster. Conserved properties, e.g., sex-specific splicing, structure of the female-specific 3' splice site, a splicing enhancer region with binding motifs for the TRA2/RBP1/TRA complex that activates female-specific splicing in Drosophila, and conserved domains for DNA-binding and oligomerization in the putative DSX protein, indicate functional conservation of dsx in M. scalaris.

We now show that a novel MMAP, Lava Lamp (Lva), is also required for cellularization. Lva is a coiled-coil protein and, unlike other proteins previously implicated in cellularization or cytokinesis, it is Golgi associated. Our functional analysis shows that cellularization is dramatically inhibited upon injecting anti-Lva antibodies (IgG and Fab) into embryos. In addition, we show that brefeldin A, a potent inhibitor of membrane trafficking, also inhibits cellularization. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that Lva physically interacts with the MMAPs Spectrin and CLIP190. We suggest that Lva and Spectrin may form a Golgi-based scaffold that mediates the interaction of Golgi bodies with microtubules and facilitates Golgi-derived membrane secretion required for the formation of furrows during cellularization. Our results are consistent with the idea that animal cell cytokinesis depends on both actomyosin-based contraction and Golgi-derived membrane secretion.",2000,"J C Sisson, C Field, R Ventura, A Royou, W Sullivan, J C Sisson, C Field, R Ventura, A Royou, W Sullivan"

Reduced X-linked nucleotide polymorphism in Drosophila simulans,10823947,10.1073/pnas.97.11.5960,"Population genetic theory predicts that selectively driven changes of allele frequency for both beneficial and deleterious mutants reduce polymorphism at tightly linked sites. All else being equal, these reductions in polymorphism are expected to be greater when recombination rates are lower. Therefore, the empirical observation of a positive correlation between recombination rates and amounts of DNA polymorphism across the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by two very different types of natural selection. Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on linked sites by comparison of X-linked and autosomal variation. We present polymorphism data from 40 genes distributed across chromosome arms X and 3R of Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. We find significantly less silent polymorphism in D. simulans on the X chromosome than on 3R, but no difference between arms for silent divergence between species. This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on linked sites. We propose that some form of positive selection having greater effects on sex chromosomes than on autosomes is the better explanation for the D. simulans data.",2000,"D J Begun, P Whitley, D J Begun, P Whitley"
Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of Drosophila melanogaster: the alpha-subunit dalpha3 and the beta-type subunit ARD co-assemble within the same receptor complex,11024458,10.1016/s0014-5793(00)02057-3,"Dalpha3 is a functional alpha-subunit of Drosophila melanogaster nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs).

Both subunits can be co-purified by alpha-bungarotoxin affinity chromatography.

Genomic organisation of the neural sex determination gene fruitless (fru) in the Hawaiian species Drosophila silvestris and the conservation of the fru BTB protein-protein-binding domain throughout evolution,10857262,10.1111/j.1601-5223.2000.00067.x,"We report the cloning and sequencing of the fru gene from the Hawaiian picture-wing species Drosophila silvestris. The fru gene has seven exons spanning 15-kb encoding two transcripts with ORFs of 841 and 695 amino acids. The protein encoded by the fruA transcript is well conserved with the D. melanogaster type A protein, particularly the BTB protein-protein-binding domain, which is encoded by exons I and II and is 100% conserved. The peptide encoded by exon III has several sequence differences but these are confined mostly to regions of repetitive sequence and exons IV to VI are well conserved. The peptide encoded by exon VII is semi-conserved for the 5' end and 100% conserved for the Zinc finger domains; the rest of the peptide is virtually unconserved. The FRUA protein has a BTB domain and two zinc finger domains whereas the FRUC protein only has the BTB domain. The genomic DNA sequence encoding the BTB domain of the fru gene has been cloned from 21 species of Diptera. The protein-coding sequence is highly conserved and the amino acid sequence is identical except for two changes in the Tephritidae. The intron sequences are completely unconserved except between very closely related species such as the Hawaiian Drosophila. The phylogeny produced using the BTB exon sequences suggests that the most closely related mainland Drosophila species to the Hawaiian clade is D. moriwakii of the melanica species group. The phylogeny also shows that the Scaptomyza are closely related to the Hawaiian Drosophila so supporting a Hawaiian origin for the Scaptomyza.

Genetic and molecular analysis in the 70CD region of the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,10767537,10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00066-4,"A collection of lethal and semi-lethal P-element insertions in the 70CD region of chromosome 3 of Drosophila melanogaster was used to investigate genes and gene arrangements by a combination of genetic, cytological, functional and molecular methods. The 12 lethal insertions studied fall into seven complementation groups of six genes. Lethal phases, expression patterns and other phenotypic aspects of these genes were determined. The genes and additional available sequences were placed on cloned genomic DNA fragments and arranged in an EcoRI map of 150kb that covers approximately the bands 70C7-8 to 70D1. Determination of deficiency breakpoints links the genetic, physical and molecular data. The sequences adjacent to seven independent P-element insertions were established after plasmid rescue or polymerase chain reaction. Similarity searches allowed the assignment of the P-element insertions to known mutations, expressed sequence tags, sequence tagged sites, or homologous genes of other species. Among these were identified a putative transacylase, a putative cell cycle gene, and the gene responsible for the dominant Polycomb-suppressor phenotype of devenir.

Drosophila nerve cells have been shown to survive inside the brain, differentiate, form ganglion-resembling structure, and come into synaptic contact with the host tissue. The embryonic nerve cells of transgenic Delta mutants of Drosophila melanogaster carrying a gene of bacterial galactosidase (lacZ) were also transplanted into the brain of adult rats and then identified histologically by X-gal staining of brain sections for the lacZ-gene product. The xenografts were shown to survive in the host brain for at least 2-3 weeks, after which they were attacked by macrophages. No glial scar tissue formed around the site of the xenograft. Cotransplantation of Drosophila embryonic nerve cells and the homologous embryonic nerve tissue was favorable for homograft survival and development, because formation of the glial scar was blocked, whereas homograft vascularization and differentiation of its nerve cells were stimulated. The results obtained are of interest with regard to neurosurgery, because they may be used to prevent formation of glial scar, an important factor in successful neurotransplantation.",2000,"L I Korochkin, L I Korochkin"
New insights on homology-dependent silencing of I factor activity by transgenes containing ORF1 in Drosophila melanogaster,11063690,,"I factors in Drosophila melanogaster are non-LTR retrotransposons that transpose at very high frequencies in the germ line of females resulting from crosses between reactive females (devoid of active I factors) and inducer males (containing active I factors). Constructs containing I factor ORF1 under the control of the hsp70 promoter repress I factor activity. This repressor effect is maternally transmitted and increases with the transgene copy number. It is irrespective of either frame integrity or transcriptional orientation of ORF1, suggesting the involvement of a homology-dependent trans-silencing mechanism. A promoterless transgene displays no repression. The effect of constructs in which ORF1 is controlled by the hsp70 promoter does not depend upon heat-shock treatments. No effect of ORF1 is detected when it is controlled by the I factor promoter. We discuss the relevance of the described regulation to the repression of I factors in I strains.",2000,"S Malinsky, A Bucheton, I Busseau, S Malinsky, A Bucheton, I Busseau"
The multifunctional deoxynucleoside kinase of insect cells is a target for the development of new insecticides,10727530,10.1124/mol.57.4.811,"The antiherpetic agent (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) was found to be an efficient substrate for recombinant Drosophila melanogaster-deoxyribonucleoside kinase with a K(m) of 4.5 microM and a V(max) of 400 nmol/microg protein/h compared with 1.3 microM and 62.5 nmol/microg protein/h, respectively, for the natural substrate thymidine. Mammalian cytosolic thymidine kinase-1 does not recognize BVDU as a substrate. In sharp contrast to mammalian cells, the insect D. melanogaster and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) embryonic cells proved highly sensitive to the cytostatic action of BVDU. BVDU was efficiently metabolized to its 5'-mono-, 5'-di- and 5'-triphosphate derivatives in the insect cell cultures and abundantly incorporated into the insect cell DNA. BVDU prevented the D. melanogaster cells to initiate the S phase of their cell cycle, and exposure of S. frugiperda cells to BVDU led to a dose-dependent retardation of the insect cells in the S phase of their cell cycle. Both inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis (through the 5'-triphosphate of BVDU) and inhibition of thymidylate synthase (through the 5'-monophosphate of BVDU) would account for the cytostatic activity of BVDU against the insect cells. Because of the virtual lack of cytotoxicity of BVDU against mammalian cells, the drug should be considered highly selective in its cytostatic action against the insect cells. When added to the food of S. frugiperda larvae, BVDU caused a remarkable decrease in the weight gain of the larvae and heavily compromised the transformation of the larvae to the pupae and their subsequent adult (moth) phase.

We report results showing that I factor transcripts end a few nucleotides downstream of the TAA repeats and that these extra nucleotides are not integrated into chromosomal DNA during retrotransposition. We also show that the TAA repeats are not required for transposition and that I elements containing mutations affecting the TAA sequences generate transposed copies ending with tandem repeats of various types. Our results suggest that during integration the 3' end of the I factor RNA template can pair with nucleotides at the target site and that tandem duplications are generated by the reverse transcriptase of the I factor in a manner that is reminiscent of the activity of the reverse transcriptases of telomerases.

A genetic test of the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility in Drosophila,10655228,,"Cytoplasmic bacteria of the genus Wolbachia are best known as the cause of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI): many uninfected eggs fertilized by Wolbachia-modified sperm from infected males die as embryos. In contrast, eggs of infected females rescue modified sperm and develop normally. Although Wolbachia cause CI in at least five insect orders, the mechanism of CI remains poorly understood. Here I test whether the target of Wolbachia-induced sperm modification is the male pronucleus (e.g., DNA or pronuclear proteins) or some extranuclear factor from the sperm required for embryonic development (e.g., the paternal centrosome). I distinguish between these hypotheses by crossing gynogenetic Drosophila melanogaster females to infected males. Gynogenetic females produce diploid eggs whose normal development requires no male pronucleus but still depends on extranuclear paternal factors. I show that when gynogenetic females are crossed to infected males, uniparental progeny with maternally derived chromosomes result. This finding shows that Wolbachia impair the male pronucleus but no extranuclear component of the sperm.",2000,"D C Presgraves, D C Presgraves"

Evolution of the Drosophila melanogaster-sigma virus system in natural populations from Languedoc (southern France),8470948,10.1007/BF01316890,"An analysis of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster in a southern French region (Languedoc) was started in 1983, concerning two non Mendelian systems: the P-M system of transposable elements and the sigma virus. This virus is not contagious, but only transmitted through gametes; it is usually present in a minority of individuals in natural populations. The first data collected revealed unexpectedly clear and fast-evolving phenomena; they also gave evidence of some interesting correlations between the two systems. This paper presents all the results gathered from 1983 to 1991 in the Drosophila-sigma system. Striking correlations were observed for three interconnected parameters: frequency of infected flies, frequency of an allele of the fly giving resistance to the virus, and adaptation of the virus to this allele. This adaptation consisted of a qualitative step (change of viral type) followed by quantitative variation (better adaptation to the allele). This analysis also showed, firstly, that the evolution of natural populations differs completely in Languedoc from the rest of France; secondly, that three geographical zones where selective forces worked differently persisted over time in Languedoc.",1993,"A Fleuriet, G Periquet, A Fleuriet, G Periquet"

Mutations of the fizzy locus cause metaphase arrest in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,8223258,,"We describe the effects of mutations in the fizzy gene of Drosophila melanogaster and show that fizzy mutations cause cells in mitosis to arrest at metaphase.

In fizzy embryos, dividing cells in these tissues arrest at metaphase, fail to differentiate and ultimately die. In the ventral epidermis, if cells are prevented from entering mitosis by using a string mutation, cell death is prevented and the ability to differentiate ventral epidermis is restored in fizzy; string double mutant embryos. These results demonstrate that fizzy is a cell cycle mutation and that the normal function of the fizzy gene is required for dividing cells to exit metaphase and complete mitosis.",1993,"I A Dawson, S Roth, M Akam, S Artavanis-Tsakonas, I A Dawson, S Roth, M Akam, S Artavanis-Tsakonas"

At low larval density, that indirect selection showed no effect. At high larval density, however, increased mean life-span in lines reproduced at late age was observed. When these last data are examined as a function of the number of days after the beginning of the experiment, instead of as a function of generations, the difference in life-span between early and late lines at high larval density disappears. The erratic evolutions of mean longevities in all the experiments here described may be attributed to unexplained variations in life-span previously observed in a 4-year experiment. Considering the time lag between the measurement of a given generation in early and late lines, the experiments of reproduction at late age cannot demonstrate the genetic determinism of longevity.",1993,"P Baret, F A Lints, P Baret, F A Lints"
Cold adaptations in Drosophila. Qualitative changes of triacylglycerols with relation to overwintering,8420958,,"Triacylglycerols are the major fuel for basal metabolism during the winter in temperate species of the Drosophila melanogaster species group. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the transition temperatures of triacylglycerols were lower in diapausing adults than in reproducing ones, and also lower in species or strains adapted to cooler climates than those adapted to warmer climates. These phenomena were correlated to the fatty acid compositions of the triacylglycerols; the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the triacylglycerols was higher in the diapausing individuals, and in the species or strains adapted to cooler climates. Furthermore, in the temperate species of the montium species subgroup (D. subauraria, D. biauraria, D. triauraria, and D. rufa), the amount of saturated triacylglycerols was smaller than the value expected on the assumption that fatty acids are randomly distributed in the triacylglycerols, suggesting the nonrandom distribution of unsaturated fatty acids among triacylglycerols. This may facilitate the lowering of the transition temperature of triacylglycerols, and hence may be related to the ability of Drosophila to cope with temperate climates.",1993,"T Ohtsu, C Katagiri, M T Kimura, S H Hori, T Ohtsu, C Katagiri, M T Kimura, S H Hori"
DNA sequence variation at the period locus within and among species of the Drosophila melanogaster complex,8436278,,"A 1.9-kilobase region of the period locus was sequenced in six individuals of Drosophila melanogaster and from six individuals of each of three sibling species: Drosophila simulans, Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila mauritiana.

It appears that D. simulans, as a large population still segregating very old lineages, gave rise to the island species D. mauritiana and D. sechellia. Rather than considering these speciation events as having produced ""sister"" taxa, it seems more appropriate to consider D. simulans a parent species to D. sechellia and D. mauritiana. The order, in time, of these two phylogenetic events remains unclear. D. mauritiana supports a large number of polymorphisms, many of which are shared with D. simulans, and so appears to have begun and persisted as a large population. In contrast, D. sechellia has very little variation and seems to have experienced a severe population bottleneck. Alternatively, the low variation in D. sechellia could be due to recent directional selection and genetic hitchhiking at or near the per locus.",1993,"R M Kliman, J Hey, R M Kliman, J Hey"

The phospholipid changes were not ethanol-specific. Larvae fed ethanol, n-butanol, isopropanol, methanol, and n-propanol exhibited similar changes. 3. At 200 mM concentrations, dietary ethanol acted as a competitive inhibitor for the larval uptake of dietary choline. At higher concentrations, dietary ethanol acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor.

The cis-acting regulatory elements that control expression of Deb-A during embryogenesis were localized using a somatic transformation assay. The Adh gene of D. melanogaster was used as a 'reporter' gene. The promoterless ADH coding sequence was fused to the 5'-upstream control region of Deb-A. Deletions were introduced into the 5'-region using various restriction sites and Bal31 deletion mutagenesis. A negative regulatory element, or silencer, was localized to a segment 47 base pairs long, between -395 and -442. It is responsible for 80% of the repression of gene expression during late development and reduces levels of Deb-A RNA nearly 5-fold. This negative element is temporally functional. It becomes active after 15 h of embryogenesis and it has no effect on gene expression prior to that. Within this negative element of 47 base pairs, two footprint regions were protected from DNase I digestion by embryonic nuclear extracts: one region contains an AP-1 binding site, but the other footprint is due to unknown element(s). High molecular weight DNA-protein complexes on an oligonucleotide probe spanning the AP-1 binding site were identified in gel retardation assays using partially purified bacterially expressed Djun protein or nuclear extracts from Drosophila embryos.

Slowing of age-specific mortality rates in Drosophila melanogaster,8137895,10.1016/0531-5565(93)90048-i,"We have studied age-dependent mortality in large cohorts of male and female D. melanogaster from four inbred lines. Average longevity varies substantially between genotypes (broad-sense heritability = 22%). Contrary to the predictions of the Gompertz model, mortality rates tend to decelerate at the most advanced ages. Fitting Gompertz, Weibull, Logistic, and Two-stage Gompertz mortality models to the data, we find that the best fit is obtained with the two-stage model, with exponentially increasing mortality at early ages, and zero or nearly zero increase at older ages. There is little microenvironmental effect from cage to cage. There is a sex-dependent mortality crossover: males and females differ in initial mortality rate and degree of acceleration of mortality rate, but the ordering of the sexes according to mortality parameters depends on genotype. Model fitting can be affected by gaps between deaths in the tail of the survivorship distribution. The observations are inconsistent with the limited life-span paradigm, which predicts sudden and well-defined drops in survivorship and corresponding sharp increases in mortality at advanced ages for large cohorts of genetically identical individuals.",1993,"H H Fukui, L Xiu, J W Curtsinger, H H Fukui, L Xiu, J W Curtsinger"
Cellular mechanisms governing synaptic development in Drosophila melanogaster,8251016,10.1002/neu.480240606,"The neuromuscular connections of Drosophila are ideally suited for studying synaptic function and development. Hypotheses about cell recognition can be tested in a simple array of pre- and postsynaptic elements. Drosophila muscle fibers are multiply innervated by individually identifiable motoneurons. The neurons express several synaptic cotransmitters, including glutamate, proctolin, and octopamine, and are specialized by their synaptic morphology, neurotransmitters, and connectivity. During larval development the initial motoneuron endings grow extensively over the surface of the muscle fibers, and differentiate synaptic boutons of characteristic morphology. While considerable growth occurs postembryonically, the initial wiring of motoneurons to muscle fibers is accomplished during mid-to-late embryogenesis (stages 15-17). Efferent growth cones sample multiple muscle fibers with rapidly moving filopodia. Upon reaching their target muscle fibers, the growth cones rapidly differentiate into synaptic contacts whose morphology prefigures that of the larval junction. Mismatch experiments show that growth cones recognize specific muscle fibers, and can do so when the surrounding musculature is radically altered. However, when denied their normal targets, motoneurons can establish functional synapses on alternate muscle fibers. Blocking synaptic activity with either injected toxins or ion channel mutants does not derange synaptogenesis, but may influence the number of motor ending processes. The molecular mechanisms governing cellular recognition during synaptogenesis remain to be identified. However, several cell surface glycoproteins known to mediate cellular adhesion events in vitro are expressed by the developing synapses.

Maternal repression of the P element promoter in the germline of Drosophila melanogaster: a model for the P cytotype,8224815,,"The transposition of P elements in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by products encoded by the P elements themselves. The P cytotype, which represses transposition and associated phenomena, exhibits both a maternal effect and maternal inheritance. The genetic and molecular mechanisms of this regulation are complex and not yet fully understood. In a previous study, using P-lacZ fusion genes, we have shown that P element regulatory products were able to inhibit the activity of the P promoter in somatic tissues. However, the repression observed did not exhibit the maternal effect characteristic of the P cytotype. With a similar approach, we have assayed in vivo the effect of P element regulatory products in the germline. We show that the P cytotype is able to repress the P promoter in the germline as well as in the soma. Furthermore, this repression exhibits a maternal effect restricted to the germline. On the basis of these new observations, we propose a model for the mechanism of P cytotype repression and its maternal inheritance.",1993,"B Lemaitre, S Ronsseray, D Coen, B Lemaitre, S Ronsseray, D Coen"
Cloning of the fourth functional gene for protein phosphatase 1 in Drosophila melanogaster from its chromosomal location,8383037,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17648.x,"Complementary DNA encoding a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1, PP1 87B, hybridises at four positions (87B, 9C, 13C and 96A) to Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes, three of which are known to be expressed [DombrÃ¡di, V., Axton, J.M., Brewis, N.D., Da Cruz e Silva, E.F., Alphey, L. & Cohen, P.T.W.

Consequences of topoisomerase II inhibition in early embryogenesis of Drosophila revealed by in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy,8391015,,"The regulation of DNA topology by topoisomerase II from Drosophila melanogaster has been studied extensively by biochemical methods but little is known about its roles in vivo. We have performed experiments on the inhibition of topoisomerase II in living Drosophila blastoderm embryos. We show that the enzymatic activity can be specifically disrupted by microinjection of antitopoisomerase II antibodies as well as the epipodophyllotoxin VM26, a known inhibitor of topoisomerase II in vitro. By labeling the chromatin of live embryos with tetramethylrhodamine-coupled histones, the effects of inhibition on nuclear morphology and behaviour was followed in vivo using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Both the antibodies and the drug prevented or hindered the segregation of chromatin daughter sets at the anaphase stage of mitosis. In addition, high concentrations of inhibitor interfered with the condensation of chromatin and its proper arrangement into the metaphase plate. The observed effects yielded non-functional nuclei, which were drawn into the inner yolk mass of the embryo. Concurrently, undamaged nuclei surrounding the affected region underwent compensatory division, leading to the restoration of the nuclear population, and thereby demonstrating the regulative capacity of Drosophila blastoderm embryos.",1993,"P Buchenau, H Saumweber, D J Arndt-Jovin, P Buchenau, H Saumweber, D J Arndt-Jovin"

Heat shock induces changes in the expression and binding of ubiquitin in senescent Drosophila melanogaster,7683258,10.1002/dvg.1020140110,"We examined the effect of aging on the expression of ubiquitin RNA and the binding of the ubiquitin polypeptide to proteins following heat shock in Drosophila melanogaster. Heat-shocked adult flies transcribe two major RNA species--one of 4.4 kb and one of about 6 kb that hybridize to the polyubiquitin-encoding probe. Several less abundant RNAs were also observed but the 4.4-kb band was present as the major RNA species in both stressed and nonstressed flies of both ages. The 6-kb fragment was more abundant in heat shocked aged flies than in younger flies. The quantitative expression of the polyubiquitin gene increased in proportion to the duration of the heat stress. Moreover, the induction of the polyubiquitin RNA was markedly elevated during aging following heat shock. Hybridization of Northern blots with the monoubiquitin gene probe revealed a band of 0.9 kb that was not significantly affected by heat stress. We also investigated the relationship between the changes in polyubiquitin gene expression and the formation of ubiquitin-protein complexes in aging heat-shocked flies. Heat shock to old flies results in a significant increase in the level of proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-ubiquitin antibodies. In the case of proteins synthesized 2 h before heat shock, most of the ubiquitinated proteins were of high molecular weight. For those proteins synthesized during a 30-min heat shock and the 2 h following heat shock, two major immunoprecipitated bands were observed: an 80-kD and a 70-kD polypeptide. The ubiquitination of a 60 kD protein was also observed in nonstressed flies, but its formation was drastically reduced following heat shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,"A Niedzwiecki, J E Fleming, A Niedzwiecki, J E Fleming"
The Drosophila gene rbp9 encodes a protein that is a member of a conserved group of putative RNA binding proteins that are nervous system-specific in both flies and humans,7680064,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.13-03-01045.1993,"The rbp9 gene of Drosophila melanogaster has been molecularly characterized and shown to be expressed solely in the CNS, where it encodes proteins with three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Sequencing of genomic and cDNA clones of rbp9 revealed a complex gene with three alternative promoters as well as alternative patterns of splicing. The deduced amino acid sequence of the RBP9 proteins is highly similar to those of three other nervous system-specific genes, human HuC and HuD and Drosophila elav, which also encode proteins with three RRMs. Developmental Northern analysis revealed that rbp9 is expressed from the late third instar larva through adult stages. The RBP9 protein was detected specifically in nuclei of the nervous system after morphogenesis of the adult CNS in the mid-pupal stage. Thus, the RBP9 protein does not appear until substantially later than rbp9 transcripts are detected. The adult nervous system nuclear-limited expression pattern, the presence of RRMs, and the high similarity to a group of nervous system-specific proteins in flies and humans suggest that rbp9 belongs to a nervous system-specific RRM protein gene subfamily that may participate in the processing of RNAs involved in the development of the CNS.",1993,"Y J Kim, B S Baker, Y J Kim, B S Baker"

Toxicity and pathology of crude broth filtrate produced by Hirsutella thompsonii var. thompsonii in shake culture,8463709,10.1006/jipa.1993.1025,"Metabolic products secreted by the fungal mycelia of Hirsutella thompsonii var. thompsonii (CBS 556.77D) in a defined culture broth in shake culture were tested for toxicity to Galleria mellonella larvae and Drosophila melanogaster adults via injection and per os application, respectively. In addition, the toxic effect of broth filtrate was observed in vitro in a cell line of Bombyx mori. Czapek-Dox broth fortified with 1% yeast extract stimulated more rapid mycelial growth and correspondingly more toxin production in time. At 25-30 degrees C, metabolic toxin(s) was detected in broth via bioassay at about 4-5 days postinoculation when mycelial biomass reached 5 mg/ml (dry wt). At these temperatures, biological activity of the filtrate peaked at about 8-10 days when mycelial growth reached a maximum (10 mg/ml, dry wt). This suggests a positive relationship between toxic metabolite and mycelial production. After 10 days, the toxicity of the filtrate appeared to decline gradually. Pathogenicity symptoms of the metabolites developed slowly in both G. mellonella and D. melanogaster. Early signs of lethargy appeared at 4 days postinjection and cumulative mortality of G. mellonella larvae was low after 1 week; however, the percentage of mortality reached 98-100% after 14 days. At death, G. mellonella larvae displayed small dark spots on a brownish cuticle. Histopathological effects were observed in the larval midgut, malpighian tubules, hypodermis, fat body, hemocytes, muscle, and silk glands. Cellular change consisted of pycnosis of the nucleus and a reduction in cytoplasm density.

A Drosophila GATA family member that binds to Adh regulatory sequences is expressed in the developing fat body,8187633,,"We have identified a Drosophila transcription factor that binds a sequence element found in the larval promoters of all known alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes. DNA sequence analysis of cDNA clones encoding this protein, box A-binding factor (ABF), reveals that it is a member of the GATA family of transcriptional regulatory factors. ABF-binding sites within the D. mulleri and D. melanogaster larval Adh promoters function as positive regulatory elements and in cotransfection experiments, ABF functions as a transcriptional activator. In further support of a role for ABF in the regulation of Adh expression, ABF mRNA is expressed in the embryonic fat body, a tissue that contains high levels of Adh mRNA. Our studies demonstrate that the fat body develops from segmentally repeated clusters of mesodermal cells, which later expand and coalesce to form the mature fat body. These observations establish ABF as the earliest known fat body precursor marker in the Drosophila embryo. Together with the established role of GATA factors during mammalian development, these results suggest that ABF may play a key role in the organogenesis of the fat body.",1993,"T Abel, A M Michelson, T Maniatis, T Abel, A M Michelson, T Maniatis"
A Drosophila homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe act2 gene,8274139,,"Diverse proteins that are 35% to 55% identical to actins have been discovered recently in yeasts, nematodes, and vertebrates. In order to study these proteins systematically and relate their functions to those of conventional actins, we are isolating the corresponding genes from the genetically tractable eukaryote, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report the isolation and partial characterization of a Drosophila homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe act2 gene. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers specifying peptides that are highly conserved within the actin protein superfamily were used in conjunction with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a portion of the Drosophila gene that we have named actr66B. The corresponding full-length cDNA sequence encodes a protein of 418 residues that is 65% identical to the product of the S. pombe act2 gene, 80% identical to the bovine act2 homologue, but only 48% identical to the principal Drosophila cytoplasmic actin encoded by the Act5C actin gene. Alignment of the yeast, bovine, and Drosophila actin-related proteins shows that they have four peptide insertions, relative to conventional actins, three of which are well placed to modify actin polymerization and one that is likely to perturb the binding of myosin. Locations of two of the five actr66B introns are conserved between Drosophila and yeast genes, further attesting that they evolved from a common ancestor and are likely to encode proteins having similar functions. We demonstrate that the Drosophila gene is located on the left arm of chromosome 3, within subdivision 66B. Finally, we show by RNA blot-hybridization that the gene is expressed at low levels, relative to conventional nonmuscle actin, in all developmental stages. From these and other observations we infer that the actr66B protein is a minor component of all cells, perhaps serving to modify the polymerization, structure, and dynamic behavior of actin filaments.",1993,"C Fyrberg, E Fyrberg, C Fyrberg, E Fyrberg"

Biogenic amine systems in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,10332728,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0029(19990415)45:2<106::AID-JEMT5>3.0.CO;2-3,"Biogenic amines are important neuroactive molecules of the central nervous system (CNS) of several insect species. Serotonin (5HT), dopamine (DA), histamine (HA), and octopamine (OA) are the amines which have been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster. Each one of the four aminergic neuronal systems exhibits a stereotypic pattern of a small number of neurons that are widely distributed in the fly CNS. In this review, histochemical and immunocytochemical data on the distribution of the amine neurons in the larval and adult nervous system, are summarized. The majority of DA and 5HT neurons are interneurons, most of which are found in bilateral clusters. 5HT innervation is found in the feeding apparatus as well as in the endocrine organ of the larva, the ring gland. The octopaminergic neuronal population consists of both interneurons and efferent neurons. In the larval CNS all OA immunoreactive somata are localized in the midline of the ventral ganglion while in the adult CNS both unpaired neurons and bilateral clusters of immunoreactive cells are observed. One target of OA innervation is the abdominal muscles of the larval body wall where OA immunoreactivity is associated with the type II boutons in the axonal terminals. Histamine is mainly found in all photoreceptor cells where it is considered to be the major neurotransmitter molecule, and in specific mechanosensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Similarities between specific aminergic neurons and innervation sites in Drosophila and in other insect species are discussed. In addition, studies on the development and differentiation of 5HT and DA neurons are reviewed and data on the localization of 5HT, DA, and OA receptors are included as well.

The levels of DNA and amino acid identity are very high with respect to one another, and are most similar to HSP70 sequences linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region in other species.

The P-Ph protein-mediated repression of yellow expression depends on different cis- and trans-factors in Drosophila melanogaster,10430589,,"The ph(P1) allele of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a chimeric P-Ph protein that contains the DNA-binding domain of the P-element transposase and the Ph protein lacking 12 amino-terminal amino acids. It has been shown that the P-Ph protein is responsible for the formation of a repressive complex on P elements inserted at the yellow locus. Here we demonstrate that an enhancer element can suppress the P-Ph-mediated inhibition of yellow transcription. However, an increase of P-element copy number at the yellow locus overcomes the enhancer effect. The mobilization of P-element transposition induced the appearance with a high frequency of Su(y) mutations that partially or completely suppressed the inhibitory effect of ph(P1) on yellow expression. The Su(y) mutations were localized at different sites on chromosomes. One strong Su(y) mutation, sn(eP1), was found to be induced by a 1.2-kb P-element insertion into the transcribed noncoding region of the singed locus. The Su(y) mutations resulted in a high level of transcription of the 1.2-kb P element that contained the sequences encoding one DNA-binding and two protein-protein interaction domains of the transposase. The effect of Su(y) mutations can be explained by the competition between the truncated transposase encoded by a 1.2-kb P element and the P-Ph protein for binding sites on P-element insertions.",1999,"I Biryukova, T Belenkaya, H Hovannisian, E Kochieva, P Georgiev, I Biryukova, T Belenkaya, H Hovannisian, E Kochieva, P Georgiev"
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FEEDING RATE AND PARASITOID RESISTANCE IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565507,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb04544.x,"Replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster have been selected for increased resistance against one of two species of parasitoid wasp, Asobara tabida and Leptopilina boulardi. In both cases, it has been shown that an improved ability to mount an immunological defense against the parasitoid's egg is associated with reduced survival when the larvae are reared under conditions of low resource availability and thus high competition. We show here that in both sets of selected lines, lower competitive ability is associated with reduced rates of larval feeding, as measured by the frequency of retractions of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton. This suggests that the same or similar physiological processes are involved in the trade-off between competition and resistance against either parasitoid and shows how the interaction between adaptations for competition and natural enemy resistance may be mediated.",1999,"M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray, M D E Fellowes, A R Kraaijeveld, H C J Godfray"
"Mated Drosophila melanogaster females require a seminal fluid protein, Acp36DE, to store sperm efficiently",10511562,,"Mated females of many animal species store sperm. Sperm storage profoundly influences the number, timing, and paternity of the female's progeny. To investigate mechanisms for sperm storage in Drosophila melanogaster, we generated and analyzed mutations in Acp36DE. Acp36DE is a male seminal fluid protein whose localization in mated females suggested a role in sperm storage. We report that male-derived Acp36DE is essential for efficient sperm storage by females. Acp36DE(1) (null) mutant males produced and transferred normal amounts of sperm and seminal fluid proteins. However, mates of Acp36DE(1) males stored only 15% as many sperm and produced 10% as many adult progeny as control-mated females. Moreover, without Acp36DE, mated females failed to maintain an elevated egg-laying rate and decreased receptivity, behaviors whose persistence (but not initiation) normally depends on the presence of stored sperm. Previous studies suggested that a barrier in the oviduct confines sperm and Acp36DE to a limited area near the storage organs. We show that Acp36DE is not required for barrier formation, but both Acp36DE and the barrier are required for maximal sperm storage. Acp36DE associates tightly with sperm. Our results indicate that Acp36DE is essential for the initial storage of sperm, and that it may also influence the arrangement and retention of stored sperm.",1999,"D M Neubaum, M F Wolfner, D M Neubaum, M F Wolfner"

We have found that Q and M' populations of flies have increased their range within the cline at the expense of P lines. Q populations were found to be in the north of the cline and M' populations in the south. Some of the northern Q lines transmit repression through both sexes and type I deletion elements have been isolated from them. We suggest that these elements are responsible for Q type repression.

The dcy mRNA is detected in the compound eyes as well as in the ocelli. The presence of a putative signal peptide and the extracellular location of DCY suggest that DCY is a secreted protein. Interestingly, the dcy gene shows sequence similarities to some insect cuticular proteins and is detected as well in two closely related Drosophila species, D. sechellia and D. simulans, and in one more distantly related species, D. virilis. This finding supports the hypothesis that Drosophila used the same strategy as vertebrates and mollusks, namely, recruiting a multifunctional protein for refraction in the lens, by a gene-sharing mechanism. Furthermore, it supports our intercalary evolution hypothesis, which suggests that the development of an elaborate structure (for example, a compound eye) from an original primitive form (an ancestral photoreceptor organ) can be achieved by recruiting novel genes into the original developmental pathway.",1999,"H Janssens, W J Gehring, H Janssens, W J Gehring"

These results suggest that both C and f(5)C as the wobble bases at the anticodon first position (position 34) can recognize A at the codon third position (position 3) in the fruit fly mt translation system. tRNA(Ser)GCU corresponding to AGU, AGC and AGA serine codons was found to contain unmodified G at the anticodon wobble position, suggesting the utilization of an unconventional G34-A3 base pair during translation. When these tRNA anticodon sequences are compared with those of other animal counterparts, it is concluded that either unmodified C or G at the wobble position can recognize A at the codon third position and that modification from A to t(6)A at position 37, 3'-adjacent to the anticodon, seems to be important for tRNA possessing C34 to recognize A3 in the mRNA in the fruit fly mt translation system.",1999,"K Tomita, T Ueda, S Ishiwa, P F Crain, J A McCloskey, K Watanabe, K Tomita, T Ueda, S Ishiwa, P F Crain, J A McCloskey, K Watanabe"
Effects of aging on the acquisition and extinction of excitatory conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,10477051,10.1016/s0031-9384(99)00058-x,"Young (7-day-old), middle-aged (28-day-old), and old (49-day-old) Drosophila melanogaster were compared for acquisition, then extinction, of excitatory conditioning of the Proboscis Extension Response. The contribution of nonassociative processes (sucrose-induced Central Excitatory State, Pseudoconditioning) in the elicitation of conditioned responses was simultaneously assessed. Old flies displayed a faster and stronger acquisition than middle-aged ones, whereas no significant acquisition was stated in young flies. The influence of nonassociative processes on the acquisition was of minor importance, even though Central Excitatory State increased with age. Old flies proved also to be the slowest to extinguish. Because nonassociative contamination was not involved during extinction, one may wonder whether extinction was delayed in old flies mainly due to a higher level of acquisition or to a behavioral rigidity.",1999,"N Fresquet, N Fresquet"
"Alpha-actinin in different invertebrate muscle cell types of Drosophila melanogaster, the earthworm Eisenia foetida, and the snail Helix aspersa",10360229,10.1023/a:1005455931815,"The presence and distribution of alpha-actinin has been studied in several invertebrate muscle cell types. These comprised transversely striated muscle (flight muscle) from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, transversely striated muscle (heart muscle) from the snail Helix aspersa, obliquely striated muscle (body wall muscle) from the earthworm Eisenia foetida, smooth muscle (retractor muscle) from H. aspersa, and smooth muscle (outer muscular layer of the pseudoheart) from E. foetida. The study was carried by means of Western blot analysis, ELISA, and immunohistochemical electron microscopy, using anti alpha-actinin antibody. Immunoreaction for a protein with the same molecular weight as that of mammalian alpha-actinin was detected in all muscle types studied, although the amount and intensity of immunoreaction varied among them. In the insect muscle, immunolabelling was found along the whole Z-line. In both the transversely striated muscle from the snail and the obliquely striated muscle from the earthworm, immunolabelling did not occupy the whole Z-line but showed discontinuous, orderly arranged patches along the Z-line course. In the two smooth muscles studied (snail and earthworm), immunolabelling was limited to small patches which did not show an apparently ordered distribution. Since it is assumed that alpha-actinin is located at the anchorage sites for actin filaments, present observations suggest that, only in the Drosophila muscle, actin filaments are parallelly arranged in all their course, whereas in the other invertebrate muscles studied these filaments converge on discontinuously distributed anchorage sites.",1999,"M Royuela, C Astier, B Fraile, R Paniagua, M Royuela, C Astier, B Fraile, R Paniagua"
Mushroom body ablation impairs short-term memory and long-term memory of courtship conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,10624959,10.1016/s0896-6273(00)81043-0,"We have evaluated the role of the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs) in courtship conditioning, in which experience with mated females causes males to reduce their courtship toward virgins (Siegel and Hall, 1979). Whereas previous studies indicated that MB ablation abolished learning in an olfactory conditioning paradigm (deBelle and Heisenberg, 1994), MB-ablated males were able to learn in the courtship paradigm. They resumed courting at naive levels within 30 min after training, however, while the courtship of control males remained depressed 1 hr after training. We also describe a novel courtship conditioning paradigm that established long-term memory, lasting 9 days. In MB-ablated males, memory dissipated completely within 1 day.

Another set of responses and correlated responses to selection on age at reproduction in Drosophila melanogaster,10081162,10.1098/rspb.1999.0630,"Ageing is the decline in survival probability and fertility later in adult life. It can evolve through mutation accumulation and pleiotropy. Artificial selection by age at reproduction is a useful method for detecting the effects of pleiotropy, and for producing lines that differ in their rate of ageing for further analysis. However, the approach has encountered difficulties from gene-environment interaction and inadvertent selection. We have produced a new set of selection lines in Drosophila melanogaster, breeding from either 'young' or 'old' adults, and avoiding some of the difficulties present in previous studies. Breeding from older adults resulted in an evolutionary increase in survival but, contrary to all previous studies using this method, in no increase in late-life fertility. The increase in survival was accompanied by an evolutionary decline in fertility early in adult life, confirming the importance of pleiotropy in the evolution of ageing. Contrary to previous studies, there were no correlated responses to selection in the pre-adult period; development time, larval competitive ability and adult size achieved did not differ between the lines from the two selection regimes.",1999,"L Partridge, N Prowse, P Pignatelli, L Partridge, N Prowse, P Pignatelli"
Dopaminergic modulation of motor neuron activity and neuromuscular function in Drosophila melanogaster,10327610,10.1016/s0305-0491(98)10160-8,"Dopamine is found in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues in the larval stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and functions as a signaling molecule in the nervous system. Although dopaminergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) were previously thought solely to be interneurons, recent studies suggest that dopamine may also act as a neuromodulator in humoral pathways. We examined both application of dopamine on intact larval CNS-segmental preparations and isolated neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Dopamine rapidly decreased the rhythmicity of the CNS motor activity. Application of dopamine on neuromuscular preparations of the segmental muscles 6 and 7 resulted in a dose-responsive decrease in the excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). With the use of focal, macro-patch synaptic current recordings the quantal evoked transmission showed a depression of vesicular release at concentrations of 10 microM. Higher concentrations (1 mM) produced a rapid decrement in evoked vesicular release. Dopamine did not alter the shape of the spontaneous synaptic currents, suggesting that dopamine does not alter the postsynaptic muscle fiber receptiveness to the glutaminergic motor nerve transmission. The effects are presynaptic in causing a reduction in the number of vesicles that are stimulated to be released due to neural activity.",1999,"R L Cooper, W S Neckameyer, R L Cooper, W S Neckameyer"
Centromeres from telomeres?

Sequences within the YAC clone are conserved in the centromeric region of the sibling species Drosophila simulans. That telomere-derived DNA now forms part of the centromeric region of the Y chromosome could indicate a telomeric origin of this centromere.

These males possessed all the markers of the Xbb- chromosome but lacked the Y chromosome BS marker. Genetic analysis of their progeny showed that genes responsible for restoration of viability and fertility of these exceptional males were associated with the X chromosome. The crossover tests showed that in one case these genes were tightly linked to the w locus (the bbAM1 allele), and in the second case they were located 12.6 map units to the right of the Tu locus (the bbAM7 allele). It has also been shown that the bb locus was transposed to the X chromosome within the short arm of Y chromosome.

In-situ hybridization using a digoxigenin labeled transferrin cDNA probe revealed that the gene is located at position 17B1-2 on the X chromosome. Northern blot analysis showed that transferrin mRNA was present in the larval, pupal and adult stages, but was not detectable in the embryo.

Evolution of the proportions of two sigma viral types in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster in the absence of the allele that is restrictive of viral multiplication,10581286,,"A minority of flies in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster are endemically infected by a rhabdovirus, sigma. The virus is vertically transmitted through male and female gametes. Two alleles of a fly locus, the ref(2)P locus, are present as a polymorphism in all populations: O permissive, and P restrictive for viral multiplication and transmission. Two viral types are known, Type I, which is very sensitive to the P allele, and Type II, which is more resistant. Previous observations have shown that, in presence of the P allele, viral Type II is selected for, in both natural and experimental populations. The aim of the present study was to determine whether, in the absence of P, Type I is selected for, or whether the two types are equivalent. For this purpose, experimental populations deprived of the P allele and differing in the initial proportions of the two viral types were established. After several generations, and despite a possible bias toward Type I, the frequencies of Type I and Type II clones differed in the various populations, depending on their initial values. These findings do not rule out selective advantage of viral Type I in the absence of P, but suggest that, if any, this advantage is in no way comparable to that displayed by viral Type II in the presence of P.",1999,"A Fleuriet, A Fleuriet"
Drosophila selected for extended longevity are more sensitive to heat shock,23604426,10.1007/s11357-999-0020-5,"It has been demonstrated in several animal models that a brief non-lethal application of high temperature is capable of inducing an increased longevity. It is also known that an even briefer exposure to a non-lethal elevated temperature enables some organisms to subsequently survive what would normally be a lethal exposure to high temperature. Our long-lived La strain is significantly resistant to oxidative stress due to an enhanced expression of certain antioxidant defense genes and enzyme activities. We collected survival data on 12, 463 adults of normal-lived and long-lived strains of Drosophila melanogaster in order to determine if animals selected for extended longevity also had an enhanced resistance to heat shock, and whether they exhibited thermotolerance as well. We find that normal-lived animals exhibit a heat-induced longevity extension but that long-lived animals already resistant to oxidative stress exhibit a heat-induced longevity shortening. The effects of temperature stress on longevity are strain dependent and are separable from thermotolerance effects. The trait of extended longevity based on an increased resistance to oxidative stress in the adult may be purchased at the price of a decreased fitness of the adult to other important environmental parameters.",1999,"K Kuether, R Arking, K Kuether, R Arking"
Diversity of odourant binding proteins revealed by an expressed sequence tag project on male Manduca sexta moth antennae,10620045,10.1046/j.1365-2583.1999.00146.x,"A small expressed sequence tag (EST) project generating 506 ESTs from 375 cDNAs was undertaken on the antennae of male Manduca sexta moths in an effort to discover olfactory receptor proteins. We encountered several clones that encode apparent transmembrane proteins; however, none is a clear candidate for an olfactory receptor. Instead we found a greater diversity of odourant binding proteins (OBPs) than previously known in moth antennae, raising the number known for M. sexta from three to seven. Together with evidence of seventeen members of the family from the Drosophila melanogaster genome project, our results suggest that insects may have many tens of OBPs expressed in subsets of the chemosensory sensilla on their antennae. These results support a model for insect olfaction in which OBPs selectively transport and present odourants to transmembrane olfactory receptors. We also found five members of a family of shorter proteins, named sensory appendage proteins (SAPs), that might also be involved in odourant transport. This small EST project also revealed several candidate odourant degrading enzymes including three P450 cytochromes, a glutathione S-transferase and a uridine diphosphate (UDP) glucosyltransferase.

Linkage disequilibrium mapping of molecular polymorphisms at the scabrous locus associated with naturally occurring variation in bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster,10689806,10.1017/s001667239900419x,"We evaluated the hypothesis that the Drosophila melanogaster second chromosome gene scabrous (sca), a candidate sensory bristle number quantitative trait locus (QTL), contributes to naturally occurring variation in bristle number. Variation in abdominal and sternopleural bristle number was quantified for wild-derived sca alleles in seven genetic backgrounds: as homozygous second chromosomes (C2) in an isogenic background, homozygous lines in which approximately 20 cM including the sca locus had been introgressed into the isogenic background (sca BC), as C2 and sca BC heterozygotes and hemizygotes against a P element insertional sca allele and a P-induced sca deficiency in the same isogenic background, and as sca BC heterozygotes against the wild-type sca allele of isogenic strain. Molecular restriction map variation was determined for a 45 kb region including the sca locus, and single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was examined for the third intron and parts of the third and fourth exons. Associations between each of the 27 molecular polymorphisms and bristle number were evaluated within each genotype and on the first principal component score determined from all seven genotypes, separately for each sex and bristle trait. Permutation tests were used to assess the empirical significance thresholds, accounting for multiple, correlated tests, and correlated markers.

Drosophila lebanonensis alcohol dehydrogenase: pH dependence of the kinetic coefficients,10209281,10.1016/s0167-4838(99)00028-x,"The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Drosophila lebanonensis shows 82% positional identity to the alcohol dehydrogenases from Drosophila melanogaster. These insect ADHs belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family which lack metal ions in their active site. In this family, it appears that the function of zinc in medium chain dehydrogenases has been replaced by three amino acids, Ser138, Tyr151 and Lys155. The present work on D. lebanonensis ADH has been performed in order to obtain information about reaction mechanism, and possible differences in topology and electrostatic properties in the vicinity of the catalytic residues in ADHs from various species of Drosophila. Thus the pH dependence of various kinetic coefficients has been studied. Both in the oxidation of alcohols and in the reduction of aldehydes, the reaction mechanism of D. lebanonensis ADH in the pH 6-10 region was consistent with a compulsory ordered pathway, with the coenzymes as the outer substrates. Over the entire pH region, the rate limiting step for the oxidation of secondary alcohols such as propan-2-ol was the release of the coenzyme product from the enzyme-NADH complex. In the oxidation of ethanol at least two steps were rate limiting, the hydride transfer step and the dissociation of NADH from the binary enzyme-NADH product complex. In the reduction of acetaldehyde, the rate limiting step was the dissociation of NAD+ from the binary enzyme-NAD+ product complex. The pH dependences of the kon velocity curves for the two coenzymes were the opposite of each other, i.e. kon increased for NAD+ and decreased for NADH with increasing pH. The two curves appeared complex and the kon velocity for the two coenzymes seemed to be regulated by several groups in the free enzyme. The kon velocity for ethanol and the ethanol competitive inhibitor pyrazole increased with pH and was regulated through the ionization of a single group in the binary enzyme-NAD+ complex, with a pKa value of 7.1. The kon velocity for acetaldehyde was pH independent and showed that in the enzyme-NADH complex, the pKa value of the catalytic residue must be above 10. The koff velocity of NAD+ appeared to be partly regulated by the catalytic residue, and protonation resulted in an increased dissociation rate. The koff velocity for NADH and the hydride transfer step was pH independent. In D. lebanonensis ADH, the pKa value of the catalytic residue was 0.5 pH units lower than in the ADHS alleloenzyme from D. melanogaster. Thus it can be concluded that while most of the topology of the active site is mainly conserved in these two distantly related enzymes, the microenvironment and electrostatic properties around the catalytic residues differ.",1999,"M Kaaber Brendskag, J S McKinley-McKee, J O Winberg, M Kaaber Brendskag, J S McKinley-McKee, J O Winberg"
An element with palindromic structure is required for the expression of TBP (TATA box-binding protein) gene in Drosophila melanogaster,10672937,,"Previously we showed that the 5'-flanking regions between -261 and -207 of the Drosophila melanogaster TBP (TATA box binding protein) gene is important for its expression.

We found that the 16 bp deletion from -261 to -245 greatly reduces the promoter activity of the Drosophila TBP gene. The 16 bp DNA element contains half of a 11 bp long palindromic sequence, CTTTT-GAAAAG. Disruption of the palindromic sequence by site-directed mutagenesis severely affected promoter activity. In addition, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the oligonucleotide containing the palindromic sequence can make specific DNA/protein complexes when it was mixed with the Drosophila nuclear extract, suggesting that it interacts with nuclear protein(s).

Dystroglycan is required for polarizing the epithelial cells and the oocyte in Drosophila,12441301,10.1242/dev.00199,"The transmembrane protein Dystroglycan is a central element of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, which is involved in the pathogenesis of many forms of muscular dystrophy. Dystroglycan is a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules such as Laminin, agrin and perlecan, and plays a role in linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton; however, how these interactions are regulated and their basic cellular functions are poorly understood. Using mosaic analysis and RNAi in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we show that Dystroglycan is required cell-autonomously for cellular polarity in two different cell types, the epithelial cells (apicobasal polarity) and the oocyte (anteroposterior polarity). Loss of Dystroglycan function in follicle and disc epithelia results in expansion of apical markers to the basal side of cells and overexpression results in a reduced apical localization of these same markers. In Dystroglycan germline clones early oocyte polarity markers fail to be localized to the posterior, and oocyte cortical F-actin organization is abnormal. Dystroglycan is also required non-cell-autonomously to organize the planar polarity of basal actin in follicle cells, possibly by organizing the Laminin ECM. These data suggest that the primary function of Dystroglycan in oogenesis is to organize cellular polarity; and this study sets the stage for analyzing the Dystroglycan complex by using the power of Drosophila molecular genetics.",2003,"Wu-Min Deng, Martina Schneider, Richard Frock, Casimiro Castillejo-Lopez, Emily Anne Gaman, Stefan Baumgartner, Hannele Ruohola-Baker, Wu-Min Deng, Martina Schneider, Richard Frock, Casimiro Castillejo-Lopez, Emily Anne Gaman, Stefan Baumgartner, Hannele Ruohola-Baker"
Action of nereistoxin on recombinant neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes,14608492,10.1007/s10158-003-0025-1,"Nereistoxin (NTX), a natural neurotoxin from the salivary glands of the marine annelid worm Lumbriconereis heteropoda, is highly toxic to insects. Its synthetic analogue, Cartap, was the first commercial insecticide based on a natural product. We have used voltage-clamp electrophysiology to compare the actions of NTX on recombinant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic AChRs) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes following nuclear injection of cDNAs. The recombinant nicotinic AChRs investigated were chicken alpha7, chicken alpha4beta2 and the Drosophila melanogaster/chicken hybrid receptors SAD/beta2 and ALS/beta2. No agonist action of NTX (0.1-100 microM) was observed on chicken alpha7, chicken alpha4beta2 and the Drosophila/chicken hybrid nicotinic AChRs. Currents elicited by ACh were reduced in amplitude by NTX in a dose-dependent manner. The toxin was slightly more potent on recombinant Drosophila/vertebrate hybrid receptors than on vertebrate homomeric (alpha7) or heteromeric (alpha4beta2) nicotinic AChRs. Block by NTX of the chicken alpha7, chicken alpha4beta2 and the SAD/beta2 and ALS/beta2 Drosophila/chicken hybrid receptors is in all cases non-competitive. Thus, the site of action on nicotinic AChRs of NTX, to which the insecticide Cartap is metabolised in insects, differs from that of the major nicotinic AChR-active insecticide, imidacloprid.",2003,"ValÃ©rie Raymond Delpech, Makoto Ihara, Claudio Coddou, Kazuhiko Matsuda, David B Sattelle, ValÃ©rie Raymond Delpech, Makoto Ihara, Claudio Coddou, Kazuhiko Matsuda, David B Sattelle"
Insulin stimulates glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway in Drosophila Kc cells,14644433,10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01261-4,"Drosophila melanogaster has become a prominent and convenient model for analysis of insulin action. However, to date very little is known regarding the effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism in Drosophila. Here we show that, in contrast to effects seen in mammals, insulin did not alter [(3)H]2-deoxyglucose uptake and in fact decreased glycogen synthesis ( approximately 30%) in embryonic Drosophila Kc cells. Insulin significantly increased ( approximately 1.5-fold) the production of (14)CO(2) from D-[1-(14)C]glucose while the production of (14)CO(2) from D-[6-(14)C]glucose was not altered. Thus, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation did not occur via increasing Krebs cycle activity but rather by stimulating the pentose phosphate pathway. Indeed, inhibition of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway by 6-aminonicotinamide abolished the effect of insulin on (14)CO(2) from D-[U-(14)C]glucose. A corresponding increase in lactate production but no change in incorporation of D-[U-(14)C]glucose into total lipids was observed in response to insulin. Glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate pathway may provide an important source of 5'-phosphate for DNA synthesis and cell replication. This novel observation correlates well with the fact that control of growth and development is the major role of insulin-like peptides in Drosophila. Thus, although intracellular signaling is well conserved, the metabolic effects of insulin are dramatically different between Drosophila and mammals.",2003,"Rolando B Ceddia, George J Bikopoulos, Arthur J Hilliker, Gary Sweeney, Rolando B Ceddia, George J Bikopoulos, Arthur J Hilliker, Gary Sweeney"

Comparison with the paramyosin genes of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans showed a lack of conservation of the exon/intron organization in contrast to other muscle genes. No evidence of alternative splicing sites were found, excluding the possibility that T. solium expresses a mini-paramyosin like D. melanogaster.",2003,"Laura Vargas-Parada, Juan Pedro Laclette, Laura Vargas-Parada, Juan Pedro Laclette"
"Identification and analysis of mutations in bob, Doa and eight new genes required for oocyte specification and development in Drosophila melanogaster",12930750,,"The Drosophila oocyte develops from a cluster of 16 interconnected cells that derive from a common progenitor. One of these cells, the oocyte, arrests in meiosis. The other cells endoreplicate their DNA and produce mRNAs and proteins that they traffic to the oocyte along a polarized microtubule cytoskeleton shared by the entire cyst. Therefore, Drosophila oogenesis is an attractive system for the study of cell cycle control and cell polarity. We carried out a clonal screen on the right arm of chromosome 3 for female sterile mutations using the FLP-FRT-ovo(D) system to identify new genes required for early oogenesis. We identified alleles of oo18 RNA binding protein (orb) and Darkener of apricot (Doa), which had previously been shown to exhibit oogenesis defects. We also identified several lethal alleles of the male sterile mutant, bobble (bob). In addition, we identified eight new lethal complementation groups that exhibit early oogenesis phenotypes. We analyzed mutant clones to determine the aspects of oogenesis disrupted by each complementation group. We assayed for the production and development of egg chambers, localization of ORB to and within the oocyte, and proper execution of the nurse cell cycle (endoreplication of DNA) and the oocyte cell cycle (karyosome formation). Here we discuss the identification, mapping, and phenotypic characterization of these new genes: omelet, soft boiled, hard boiled, poached, fried, over easy, sunny side up, and benedict.",2003,"Jason Z Morris, Caryn Navarro, Ruth Lehmann, Jason Z Morris, Caryn Navarro, Ruth Lehmann"
A role for CK2 in the Drosophila circadian oscillator,12563262,10.1038/nn1007,"The posttranslational modification of clock proteins is critical for the function of circadian oscillators. By genetic analysis of a Drosophila melanogaster circadian clock mutant known as Andante, which has abnormally long circadian periods, we show that casein kinase 2 (CK2) has a role in determining period length. Andante is a mutation of the gene encoding the beta subunit of CK2 and is predicted to perturb CK2beta subunit dimerization. It is associated with reduced beta subunit levels, indicative of a defect in alpha:beta association and production of the tetrameric alpha2:beta2 holoenzyme. Consistent with a direct action on the clock mechanism, we show that CK2beta is localized within clock neurons and that the clock proteins Period (Per) and Timeless (Tim) accumulate to abnormally high levels in the Andante mutant. Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of Per and Tim is delayed in Andante, and this defect accounts for the long-period phenotype of the mutant. These results suggest a function for CK2-dependent phosphorylation in the molecular oscillator.",2003,"Bikem Akten, Eike Jauch, Ginka K Genova, Eun Young Kim, Isaac Edery, Thomas Raabe, F Rob Jackson, Bikem Akten, Eike Jauch, Ginka K Genova, Eun Young Kim, Isaac Edery, Thomas Raabe, F Rob Jackson"

Application of this approach to data collected from wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal body-size cline in eastern Australia revealed that asymmetrical gene flow could be detected, but was uncommon, nonlocalized, and occurred in both directions. We also show that, in contrast to the findings of a previous study, there is good evidence to suggest that the cline experiences significant levels of gene flow between populations.",2003,"W Jason Kennington, Julia Gockel, Linda Partridge, W Jason Kennington, Julia Gockel, Linda Partridge"
The sex peptide of Drosophila melanogaster: female post-mating responses analyzed by using RNA interference,12893873,10.1073/pnas.1631635100,"Mating induces profound changes in female insect behavior and physiology. In Drosophila melanogaster, mating causes a reduction in sexual receptivity and an elevation in egg production for at least 5 days. Injection of the seminal fluid sex peptide (SP) induces both responses in virgin females, but only for 1-2 days. The role of SP in eliciting the responses to mating remains to be elucidated. Functional redundancy between seminal fluid components may occur. In addition, mating with spermless males results in brief (1- to 2-day) post-mating responses, indicating either that there is a ""sperm effect"" or that sperm act as carriers for SP or other seminal fluid components. Here we used RNA interference to suppress SP expression, to determine whether SP is required to elicit full post-mating responses, the magnitude of responses due to other seminal fluid components, and whether SP accounts for the ""sperm effect."" Receptivity was higher and egg production lower in females mated to SP knock-down males than in controls. Comparison with virgins showed that the responses were brief. SP is therefore required for normal magnitude and persistence of postmating responses. Sperm transfer and use were normal in mates of SP knock-down males, yet their post-mating responses were briefer than after normal matings, and similar to those reported in mates of spermless son-of-tudor males. The prolonged ""sperm effect"" on female receptivity and egg production is therefore entirely attributable to SP, but sperm are necessary for its occurrence.",2003,"Tracey Chapman, Jenny Bangham, Giovanna Vinti, Beth Seifried, Oliver Lung, Mariana F Wolfner, Hazel K Smith, Linda Partridge, Tracey Chapman, Jenny Bangham, Giovanna Vinti, Beth Seifried, Oliver Lung, Mariana F Wolfner, Hazel K Smith, Linda Partridge"
"Accumulation of Spock and Worf, two novel non-LTR retrotransposons, on the neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda",12598683,10.1093/molbev/msg035,"Transposable elements constitute a major fraction of eukaryotic genomes. Here, I characterize two novel non-LTR retrotransposons, cloned from the neo-Y chromosome of Drosophila miranda. Worf is 4.1 kb in size and shows homology to the T1-2 non-LTR transposon characterized in Anopheles. Spock is 4.9 kb in size and shows similarity to the Doc element of D. melanogaster. Southern blot analysis of both elements yielded stronger signals for male DNA. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes revealed that both elements are accumulating on the neo-Y chromosome of D. miranda. PCR analysis was conducted to investigate the frequency of spock and worf and of the previously identified transposons, TRIM and TRAM, at individual chromosomal sites among 12 strains of D. miranda. Contrary to the observation that element frequencies are usually kept low at individual sites in Drosophila, the four transposons investigated are fixed at their genomic locations on the neo-Y chromosome. These results support the hypothesis that transposons accumulate in nonrecombining regions and may be one cause of the heteromorphism of sex chromosomes.",2003,"Doris Bachtrog, Doris Bachtrog"
Juvenile diet restriction and the aging and reproduction of adult Drosophila melanogaster,14677635,10.1046/j.1474-9728.2003.00064.x,"Mutations of the insulin signal pathway in Drosophila melanogaster produce long-lived adults with many correlated phenotypes. Homozygotes of insulin-like receptor (InR) and insulin-like receptor substrate (chico) delay time to eclosion, reduce body size, decrease reproduction and increase life span. Because these mutations are expressed through all life stages it is unclear when insulin signals must be reduced to increase life span. As a first analysis of this problem in D. melanogaster we have manipulated the larval diet to determine if changes in metabolic regulation at this stage are sufficient to slow aging. We controlled the dietary yeast fed to third instar larvae and studied the size, mortality, fecundity and hormones of the resulting adults, which were fed a normal, yeast-replete diet. Adults from yeast-deprived larvae phenocopied many traits of InR and chico mutants: small body size, delayed eclosion, reduced ovariole number and reduced age-specific fecundity. But unlike constitutive mutants of the insulin/IGF system, adults from yeast-deprived larvae had normal patterns of demographic senescence, and this was accompanied by normal insulin-like peptide and juvenile hormone syntheses. Surprisingly, the normal aging in these adults was also associated with greatly reduced fecundity. Although nutritional conditions of the larvae can affect the subsequent body size and fecundity of adults, these are not sufficient to slow aging.",2003,"Meng-Ping Tu, Marc Tatar, Meng-Ping Tu, Marc Tatar"

A special attention is paid to the ways of signal transduction and factors involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and morphological transformation during development of the Malpighian tubules.

Nucleotide variation of the Est-6 gene region in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,14704175,,"We have investigated nucleotide polymorphism in the Est-6 gene region in four samples of Drosophila melanogaster derived from natural populations of East Africa (Zimbabwe), Europe (Spain), North America (California), and South America (Venezuela). There are two divergent sequence types in the North and South American samples, which are not perfectly (North America) or not at all (South America) associated with the Est-6 allozyme variation. Less pronounced or no sequence dimorphism occurs in the European and African samples, respectively. The level of nucleotide diversity is highest in the African sample, lower (and similar to each other) in the samples from Europe and North America, and lowest in the sample from South America. The extent of linkage disequilibrium is low in Africa (1.23% significant associations), but much higher in non-African populations (22.59, 21.45, and 37.68% in Europe, North America, and South America, respectively). Tests of neutrality with recombination are significant in non-African samples but not significant in the African sample. We propose that demographic history (bottleneck and admixture of genetically different populations) is the major factor shaping the nucleotide patterns in the Est-6 gene region. However, positive selection modifies the pattern: balanced selection creates elevated levels of nucleotide variation around functionally important (target) polymorphic sites (RsaI-/RsaI+ in the promoter region and F/S in the coding region) in both African and non-African samples; and directional selection, acting during the geographic expansion phase of D. melanogaster, creates an excess of very similar sequences (RsaI- and S allelic lineages, in the promoter and coding regions, respectively) in the non-African samples.",2003,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala"

Most of the interspecific differences in messenger RNA abundance affect male-biased genes.

Effect of the Suppressor of Underreplication (SuUR) gene on position-effect variegation silencing in Drosophila melanogaster,14668376,,"It has been previously shown that the SuUR gene encodes a protein located in intercalary and pericentromeric heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes. The SuUR mutation suppresses the formation of ectopic contacts and DNA underreplication in polytene chromosomes; SuUR+ in extra doses enhances the expression of these characters. This study demonstrates that heterochromatin-dependent PEV silencing is also influenced by SuUR. The SuUR protein localizes to chromosome regions compacted as a result of PEV; the SuUR mutation suppresses DNA underreplication arising in regions of polytene chromosomes undergoing PEV. The SuUR mutation also suppresses variegation of both adult morphological characters and chromatin compaction observed in rearranged chromosomes. In contrast, SuUR+ in extra doses and its overexpression enhance variegation. Thus, SuUR affects PEV silencing in a dose-dependent manner.

"Development of PDF-immunoreactive cells, possible clock neurons, in the housefly Musca domestica",12966497,10.1002/jemt.10365,"Even though the housefly Musca domestica shows clear circadian rhythms in its behavioural and physiological processes, a circadian pacemaker system controlling these rhythms has not yet been described morphologically in this species. In M. domestica, neurons immunoreactive to pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of circadian information arising from a circadian clock and transmitted to target cells, are similar in their number and distribution to the PDF neurons of Drosophila melanogaster. In D. melanogaster these neurons co-localize PER protein and have been identified as clock neurons in that species. Here we report PDF-immunoreactive cells in the housefly's brain during postembryonic development in the larval and pupal stages, as well as in the adult fly soon after eclosion. In the housefly's brain, there are three groups of PDF-immunoreactive neurons: two groups with small (sPDFMe) and large (lPDFMe) cell bodies in the proximal medulla of the optic lobe; and one group in the dorsal protocerebrum (PDFD). Three out of four sPDFMe can be detected during the first hour of larval development, but the fourth sPDFMe is observed in the larva only from 48 hours after hatching, along with five lPDFMe neurons, seen first as two subgroups, and three out of four PDFD neurons. During postembryonic development these neurons show changes in their structure and immunoreactivity. New PDF neurons are observed during pupal development but these neurons mostly do not survive into adulthood. In the adult fly's brain, the PDF neurons have also been examined in double-labelled preparations made with a second antibody directed against the product of one of several clock genes: period (per), timeless (tim), or cryptochrome (cry). Among them, only immunoreactivity to CRY-like protein has been detected in the brain of M. domestica and has shown a daily rhythm in its concentration, as examined immunocytochemically.

A comparison of visual and haltere-mediated equilibrium reflexes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,12477899,10.1242/jeb.00075,"Flies exhibit extraordinary maneuverability, relying on feedback from multiple sensory organs to control flight. Both the compound eyes and the mechanosensory halteres encode angular motion as the fly rotates about the three body axes during flight. Since these two sensory modalities differ in their mechanisms of transduction, they are likely to differ in their temporal responses. We recorded changes in stroke kinematics in response to mechanical and visual rotations delivered within a flight simulator. Our results show that the visual system is tuned to relatively slow rotation whereas the haltere-mediated response to mechanical rotation increases with rising angular velocity. The integration of feedback from these two modalities may enhance aerodynamic performance by enabling the fly to sense a wide range of angular velocities during flight.",2003,"Alana Sherman, Michael H Dickinson, Alana Sherman, Michael H Dickinson"

Quantitative analysis showed that the mean frequency of nuclei with defective chromosome pairing ranged from 60.4 to 76%. FISH analysis of ovarian nurse chromosomes of Canton S x Berlin hybrids showed differences in the label localization in asynaptic homologs of arm 2L, which probably results in disrupted homolog pairing and reveal interlinear differences in localization of mobile genetic elements.

Nanos plays a conserved role in axial patterning outside of the Diptera,12573218,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00045-9,"Axial patterning is a fundamental event in early development, and molecules involved in determining the body axes provide a coordinate system for subsequent patterning. While orthologs of Drosophila bicoid and nanos play a conserved role in anteroposterior (AP) patterning within at least a subset of Diptera, conservation of this process has not yet been demonstrated outside of the flies. Indeed, it has been argued that bicoid, an instrumental ""anterior"" factor in Drosophila melanogaster, acquired this role during the evolution of more-derived dipterans. Interestingly, the interaction of Drosophila maternal nanos and maternal hunchback provides a system for patterning the AP axis that is partially redundant to the anterior system. Previous studies in grasshoppers suggest that hunchback may play a conserved role in axial patterning in this insect, but this function may be supplied solely by the zygotic component of hunchback expression. Here we provide evidence that the early pattern of zygotic grasshopper Hunchback expression is achieved through translational repression that may be mediated through the action of grasshopper nanos. This is consistent with the notion that an anterior gradient system is not necessary in all insects and that the posterior pole ""probably conveys longitudinal polarity on the ensuing germ anlage"".",2003,"Sabbi Lall, Michael Z Ludwig, Nipam H Patel, Sabbi Lall, Michael Z Ludwig, Nipam H Patel"
Alternative splicing of lola generates 19 transcription factors controlling axon guidance in Drosophila,12897787,10.1038/nn1105,"The Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor Lola (longitudinals lacking) is a pivotal regulator of neural wiring that sets the precise expression levels of proteins that execute specific axon guidance decisions. Lola has a zinc finger DNA binding domain and a BTB (for Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric a brac) dimerization motif. We now show that alternative splicing of the lola gene creates a family of 19 transcription factors. All lola isoforms share a common dimerization domain, but 17 have their own unique DNA-binding domains. Seven of these 17 isoforms are present in the distantly-related Dipteran Anopheles gambiae, suggesting that the properties of specific isoforms are likely to be critical to lola function. Analysis of the expression patterns of individual splice variants and of the phenotypes of mutants lacking single isoforms supports this idea and establishes that the alternative forms of lola are responsible for different functions of this gene. Thus, in this system, the alternative splicing of a key transcription factor helps to explain how a small genome encodes all the information that is necessary to specify the enormous diversity of axonal trajectories.",2003,"Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger, Scott Goeke, Elizabeth A Greene, Paul K Grant, Michael A Gates, Daniel Crowner, Toshiro Aigaki, Edward Giniger"

Comparisons with Caenorhabditis (approximately 100 Mb) and Drosophila (approximately 175 Mb) using flow cytometry show genome size in Arabidopsis to be approximately 157 Mb and thus approximately 25% larger than the Arabidopsis genome initiative estimate of approximately 125 Mb,12646499,10.1093/aob/mcg057,"Recent genome sequencing papers have given genome sizes of 180 Mb for Drosophila melanogaster Iso-1 and 125 Mb for Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia. The former agrees with early cytochemical estimates, but numerous cytometric estimates of around 170 Mb imply that a genome size of 125 Mb for arabidopsis is an underestimate. In this study, nuclei of species pairs were compared directly using flow cytometry. Co-run Columbia and Iso-1 female gave a 2C peak for arabidopsis only approx. 15 % below that for drosophila, and 16C endopolyploid Columbia nuclei had approx. 15 % more DNA than 2C chicken nuclei (with >2280 Mb). Caenorhabditis elegans Bristol N2 (genome size approx. 100 Mb) co-run with Columbia or Iso-1 gave a 2C peak for drosophila approx. 75 % above that for 2C C. elegans, and a 2C peak for arabidopsis approx. 57 % above that for C. elegans. This confirms that 1C in drosophila is approx. 175 Mb and, combined with other evidence, leads us to conclude that the genome size of arabidopsis is not approx. 125 Mb, but probably approx. 157 Mb. It is likely that the discrepancy represents extra repeated sequences in unsequenced gaps in heterochromatic regions. Complete sequencing of the arabidopsis genome until no gaps remain at telomeres, nucleolar organizing regions or centromeres is still needed to provide the first precise angiosperm C-value as a benchmark calibration standard for plant genomes, and to ensure that no genes have been missed in arabidopsis, especially in centromeric regions, which are clearly larger than once imagined.",2003,"Michael D Bennett, Ilia J Leitch, H James Price, J Spencer Johnston, Michael D Bennett, Ilia J Leitch, H James Price, J Spencer Johnston"

Ror-family RTKs are characterized by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains, highly related to those of the Trk-family RTKs, and by the extracellular Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) and Kringle domains. Rors are evolutionally conserved among Caenorhabditis elegans, Aplysia, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus, mice, and humans. In D. melanogaster and mammals, pairs of structurally related Rors are found, while a single Ror protein is identified in C. elegans or Aplysia. In Aplysia and D. melanogaster, Rors are expressed exclusively in developing nervous systems. On the other hand, rather widespread expression of Rors was observed in C. elegans and mammals. Mutations in Ror of C. elegans cause inappropriate axon outgrowth as well as defects in cell migration and asymmetric cell division. It has also been reported that the nematode Ror possesses kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions. Mouse Rors, Ror1, and Ror2, are expressed mainly in migrating neural crest cells and mesenchymal cells, and Ror2-deficient mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities and ventricular septal defects in the heart. Although Ror1-deficient mice exhibit no apparent skeletal or cardiac abnormalities, Ror1/Ror2 double mutant mice show markedly enhanced skeletal and cardiac abnormalities compared with Ror2 mutant mice, indicating genetic interaction of Ror1 and Ror2.

"Latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster: body size, allozyme frequencies, inversion frequencies, and the insulin-signalling pathway",15133196,10.1007/BF02715819,"Many latitudinal clines exist in Drosophila melanogaster: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in D. melanogaster body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on D. melanogaster would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in D. melanogaster point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate D. melanogaster populations have a higher frequency of a 'thrifty' genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more 'spendthrift' genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.",2003,"Gerdien De Jong, ZoltÃ¡n Bochdanovits, Gerdien De Jong, ZoltÃ¡n Bochdanovits"
Glutamate-binding affinity of Drosophila metabotropic glutamate receptor is modulated by association with lipid rafts,12923296,10.1073/pnas.1737042100,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are responsible for the effects of glutamate in slow synaptic transmission, and are implicated in the regulation of many processes in the CNS. Recently, we have reported the expression and purification of a mGluR from Drosophila melanogaster (DmGluRA), a homologue of mammalian group II mGluRs. We have shown that ligand binding to reconstituted DmGluRA requires the presence of ergosterol in the liposomes [Eroglu, C., Cronet, P., Panneels, V., Beaufils, P. & Sinning, I. (2002) EMBO Rep. 3, 491-496]. Here we demonstrate that the receptor exists in different affinity states for glutamate, depending on the membrane composition. The receptor is in a high-affinity state when associated with sterol-rich lipid microdomains (rafts), and in a low-affinity state out of rafts. Enrichment of the membranes with cholesterol shifts the receptor into the high-affinity state, and induces its association with rafts. The receptor was crosslinked to photocholesterol. Our data suggest that sterol-rich lipid rafts act as positive allosteric regulators of DmGluRA.",2003,"Cagla Eroglu, Britta Brugger, Felix Wieland, Irmgard Sinning, Cagla Eroglu, Britta Brugger, Felix Wieland, Irmgard Sinning"
Influence of the SuUR gene on intercalary heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes,12644953,10.1007/s00412-002-0218-0,"Salivary gland polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster have a reproducible set of intercalary heterochromatin (IH) sites, characterized by late DNA replication, underreplicated DNA, breaks and frequent ectopic contacts. The SuUR mutation has been shown to suppress underreplication, and wild-type SuUR protein is found at late-replicating IH sites and in pericentric heterochromatin. Here we show that the SuUR gene influences all four IH features. The SuUR mutation leads to earlier completion of DNA replication. Using transgenic strains with two, four or six additional SuUR(+) doses (4-8xSuUR(+)) we show that wild-type SuUR is an enhancer of DNA underreplication, causing many late-replicating sites to become underreplicated. We map the underreplication sites and show that their number increases from 58 in normal strains (2xSuUR(+)) to 161 in 4-8xSuUR(+) strains. In one of these new sites (1AB) DNA polytenization decreases from 100% in the wild type to 51%-85% in the 4xSuUR (+) strain. In the 4xSuUR(+) strain, 60% of the weak points coincide with the localization of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. At the IH region 89E1-4 (the Bithorax complex), a typical underreplication site, the degree of underreplication increases with four doses of SuUR(+) but the extent of the underreplicated region is the same as in wild type and corresponds to the region containing PcG binding sites. We conclude that the polytene chromosome regions known as IH are binding sites for SuUR protein and in many cases PcG silencing proteins. We propose that these stable silenced regions are late replicated and, in the presence of SuUR protein, become underreplicated.",2003,"I F Zhimulev, E S Belyaeva, I V Makunin, V Pirrotta, E I Volkova, A A Alekseyenko, E N Andreyeva, G F Makarevich, L V Boldyreva, R A Nanayev, O V Demakova, I F Zhimulev, E S Belyaeva, I V Makunin, V Pirrotta, E I Volkova, A A Alekseyenko, E N Andreyeva, G F Makarevich, L V Boldyreva, R A Nanayev, O V Demakova"
Drosophila RecQ4 has a 3'-5' DNA helicase activity that is essential for viability,19759018,10.1074/jbc.M109.008052,"Members of the RecQ family of proteins are highly conserved DNA helicases that have important functions in the maintenance of genomic stability. Deficiencies in RecQ4 have been linked to human diseases including Rothmund-Thomson, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndromes, all of which are characterized by developmental defects, tumor propensity, and genetic instability. However, there are conflicting results shown in the literature regarding the DNA helicase activity of RecQ4. We report here the expression of Drosophila melanogaster RecQ4 with a baculoviral vector and its purification to near homogeneity. The purified protein has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity and is a 3'-5' DNA helicase dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. The presence of 5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, promotes stable complex formation between RecQ4 and single-stranded DNA. Drosophila RecQ4 can also anneal complementary single strands; this activity was reduced in the presence of AMPPNP, possibly because of the stable protein-DNA complex formed under such conditions. A point mutation of the highly conserved lysine residue in the helicase domain, although retaining the wild type level of annealing activity, inactivated ATPase and helicase activities and eliminated stable complex formation. These results suggest that the helicase domain alone is responsible for the DNA unwinding action of the Drosophila enzyme. We generated a null recq4 mutant that is homozygous lethal, which we used to test the genetic function of the helicase-dead mutant in flies. Complementation tests showed that the helicase-dead mutant recq4 transgenes are incapable of rescuing the null mutation, demonstrating that the helicase activity has an essential biological function.",2009,"Christopher Capp, Jianhong Wu, Tao-shih Hsieh, Christopher Capp, Jianhong Wu, Tao-shih Hsieh"
Lessons from the fly: pattern recognition in Drosophila melanogaster,19799118,10.1007/978-1-4419-0901-5_11,"Drosophila have a variety of innate immune strategies for defending itself from infection, including humoral and cell mediated responses to invading microorganisms. At the front lines of these responses, are a diverse group of pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns. These patterns include bacterial lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, and fungal beta-1,3 glucans. Some of the receptors catalytically modify the pathogenic determinant, but all are responsible for directly facilitating a signaling event that results in an immune response. Some of these events require multiple pattern recognition receptors acting sequentially to activate a pathway. In some cases, a signaling pathway may be activated by a variety of different pathogens, through parallel receptors detecting different pathogenic determinants. In this chapter, we review what is known about pattern recognition receptors in Drosophila, and how those lessons may be applied towards a broader understanding of immunity.",2009,"Subhamoy Pal, Louisa P Wu, Subhamoy Pal, Louisa P Wu"

We show that this property is based on the Dm-dNK ability to efficiently phosphorylate gemcitabine. The 2.2A resolution structure of Dm-dNK in complex with gemcitabine shows that the residues Tyr70 and Arg105 play a crucial role in the firm positioning of gemcitabine by extra interactions made by the fluoride atoms.

The Tribolium spineless ortholog specifies both larval and adult antennal identity,19030877,10.1007/s00427-008-0261-9,"The morphology of insect antennae varies widely among species, but our understanding of antennal development comes almost solely from studies of one species-the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Moreover, this knowledge applies mostly to adult structures, since Drosophila lacks external larval appendages. In contrast to Drosophila, the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, has both larval and adult antennae, which are very different from one another in morphology. Thus, Tribolium provides an ideal system to compare modes of antennal development both within and between species. Here, we report that the Tribolium ortholog of spineless (Tc-ss) is required in both the larval and adult antennae. Knockdown of Tc-ss by RNAi during either larval or imaginal development causes transformation of the distal portion of the antennae to legs. Thus, the function of ss is conserved between Drosophila and Tribolium with respect to adult antennal specification and also between Tribolium larval and adult antennal development. The similarity of the Tc-ss RNAi phenotype to that of a classically described Tribolium mutation, antennapedia (ap) (of no relationship to the Drosophila Hox gene of the same name), led us to characterize the original ap mutation and two newly identified ap alleles. Our mapping and phenotypic data suggest that Tc-ss is the best candidate for the ap locus. These results represent a first step in characterizing larval and adult antennal patterning in Tribolium, which should provide important insights into the evolution of insect antennal development.",2009,"Teresa D Shippy, Stephanie J Yeager, Robin E Denell, Teresa D Shippy, Stephanie J Yeager, Robin E Denell"
The transcriptional response of Drosophila melanogaster to infection with the sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae),19718442,10.1371/journal.pone.0006838,"Background:
      
    

    
      Bacterial and fungal infections induce a potent immune response in Drosophila melanogaster, but it is unclear whether viral infections induce an antiviral immune response. Using microarrays, we examined the changes in gene expression in Drosophila that occur in response to infection with the sigma virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus (Rhabdoviridae) that occurs in wild populations of D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      We detected many changes in gene expression in infected flies, but found no evidence for the activation of the Toll, IMD or Jak-STAT pathways, which control immune responses against bacteria and fungi. We identified a number of functional categories of genes, including serine proteases, ribosomal proteins and chorion proteins that were overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes. We also found that the sigma virus alters the expression of many more genes in males than in females.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      These data suggest that either Drosophila do not mount an immune response against the sigma virus, or that the immune response is not controlled by known immune pathways. If the latter is true, the genes that we identified as differentially expressed after infection are promising candidates for controlling the host's response to the sigma virus.",2009,"Jennifer Carpenter, Stephan Hutter, John F Baines, Julia Roller, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, John Parsch, Francis M Jiggins, Jennifer Carpenter, Stephan Hutter, John F Baines, Julia Roller, Sarah S Saminadin-Peter, John Parsch, Francis M Jiggins"

Thereafter, we performed the sex-linked recessive lethal mutation assay by mating the irradiated males with nonirradiated females. The mutation frequency in the group irradiated with 500 microGy was found to be significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01), whereas in the group subjected to 10 Gy irradiation, the mutation frequency was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.03). A J-shaped dose-response relationship was evident. Molecular experiments using DNA microarray and quantitative reverse transcription PCR indicated that several genes known to be expressed in response to heat or chemical stress and grim, a positive regulator of apoptosis, were up-regulated immediately after irradiation with 500 microGy.

Structure and ligand binding of the extended Tudor domain of D. melanogaster Tudor-SN,19232356,10.1016/j.jmb.2009.02.018,"The Tudor-SN protein (p100, SND1) has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, such as transcription, processing of edited double-stranded RNA, and splicing regulation. Molecular details of these functions are not yet understood. Tudor domains have previously been shown to bind methylated ligands, such as methylated lysines and arginines. It has been suggested that the role of Tudor-SN in splicing may involve binding to such methylated ligands or to the methylated 5' cap of spliceosomal snRNAs. Here, we report the crystal structure of the extended Tudor domain of Tudor-SN from Drosophila melanogaster to a resolution of 2.1 A. NMR secondary chemical shifts, relaxation data, and residual dipolar couplings indicate that the solution and crystal structures are similar. Binding of various ligands was investigated by NMR. Binding sites and affinities were characterized by chemical shift perturbations. We show that the aromatic cage of the Tudor domain specifically binds a peptide containing symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) with micromolar affinity, while the same peptide comprising nonmethylated arginines does not show significant chemical shift perturbations. Tudor-SN preferentially recognizes sDMA over asymmetrically dimethylated arginine (aDMA). In contrast, two 5' cap analogues with different methylation patterns, as well as mono-, di-, and trimethyllysines, show no binding. Our data demonstrate that the Tudor domain of Tudor-SN specifically recognizes sDMA-containing ligands. The aromatic cage of Tudor-SN is very similar to the one in the Tudor domain of the survival of motor neuron protein, which also recognizes sDMA peptides, indicating a conserved binding motif for this methylation mark. Recognition of sDMA in the C-terminal tails of spliceosomal Sm proteins suggests how Tudor-SN may interact with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles during the regulation of splicing.",2009,"Anders Friberg, Lorenzo Corsini, AndrÃ© MourÃ£o, Michael Sattler, Anders Friberg, Lorenzo Corsini, AndrÃ© MourÃ£o, Michael Sattler"

Functional evolution of cis-regulatory modules at a homeotic gene in Drosophila,19893611,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000709,"It is a long-held belief in evolutionary biology that the rate of molecular evolution for a given DNA sequence is inversely related to the level of functional constraint. This belief holds true for the protein-coding homeotic (Hox) genes originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of the Hox genes in Drosophila embryos is essential for body patterning and is controlled by an extensive array of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). How the regulatory modules functionally evolve in different species is not clear. A comparison of the CRMs for the Abdominal-B gene from different Drosophila species reveals relatively low levels of overall sequence conservation. However, embryonic enhancer CRMs from other Drosophila species direct transgenic reporter gene expression in the same spatial and temporal patterns during development as their D. melanogaster orthologs. Bioinformatic analysis reveals the presence of short conserved sequences within defined CRMs, representing gap and pair-rule transcription factor binding sites. One predicted binding site for the gap transcription factor KRUPPEL in the IAB5 CRM was found to be altered in Superabdominal (Sab) mutations. In Sab mutant flies, the third abdominal segment is transformed into a copy of the fifth abdominal segment. A model for KRUPPEL-mediated repression at this binding site is presented. These findings challenge our current understanding of the relationship between sequence evolution at the molecular level and functional activity of a CRM. While the overall sequence conservation at Drosophila CRMs is not distinctive from neighboring genomic regions, functionally critical transcription factor binding sites within embryonic enhancer CRMs are highly conserved.

These assays identified a large number of genes implicated in the production of the larval cuticle. In D. melanogaster, these genes are activated just once during embryogenesis, during late stages where they are used for the production of the larval cuticle. Evidence is presented that the serosal cells secrete a dedicated serosal cuticle, which protects A. gambiae embryos from desiccation. Detailed temporal microarray assays of mosquito gene expression profiles revealed that the cuticular genes display biphasic expression during A. gambiae embryogenesis, first in the serosa of early embryos and then again during late stages as seen in D. melanogaster.

Regulation of calpain B from Drosophila melanogaster by phosphorylation,19694808,10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07198.x,"Calpain B is one of the two catalytically competent calpain (calcium-activated papain) isoenzymes in Drosophila melanogaster. Because structural predictions hinted at the presence of several potential phosphorylation sites in this enzyme, we investigated the in vitro phosphorylation of the recombinant protein by protein kinase A as well as by the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1 and 2. By MS, we identified Ser845 in the Ca2+ binding region of an EF-hand motif, and Ser240 close to the autocatalytic activation site of calpain B, as being the residues phosphorylated by protein kinase A. In the transducer region of the protease, Thr747 was shown to be the target of the ERK phosphorylation. Based on the results of three different assays, we concluded that the treatment of calpain B with protein kinase A and ERK1 and ERK2 kinases increases the rate of the autoproteolytic activation of the enzyme, together with the rate of the digestion of external peptide or protein substrates. Phosphorylation also elevates the Ca2+ sensitivity of the protease. The kinetic analysis of phosphorylation mimicking Thr747Glu and Ser845Glu calpain B mutants confirmed the above conclusions. Out of the three phosphorylation events tested in vitro, we verified the in vivo phosphorylation of Thr747 in epidermal growth factor-stimulated Drosophila S2 cells.

Quantification of growth asymmetries in developing epithelia,19763647,10.1140/epje/i2009-10507-6,"Many developmental processes of multicellular organisms involve the patterning and growth of two-dimensional tissues, so called epithelia. We have quantified the growth of the wing imaginal disk, which is the precursor of the adult wing, of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that growth follows a simple rule with exponentially decreasing area growth rate. Anisotropies of growth can be precisely determined by comparing experimental results to a continuum theory. Growth anisotropies are to good approximation constant in space and time. They are weak in wild-type wing disks but threefold increased in GFP-Dpp disks in which the morphogen Dpp is overexpressed. Our findings indicate that morphogens such as Dpp control tissue shape via oriented cell divisions that generate anisotropic growth.",2009,"T Bittig, O Wartlick, M GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n, F JÃ¼licher, T Bittig, O Wartlick, M GonzÃ¡lez-GaitÃ¡n, F JÃ¼licher"
Protective effects of proanthocyanidins of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) seeds on DNA damage induced by Doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster,19341778,10.1016/j.fct.2009.03.031,"Proanthocyanidins (PAs), also known as condensed tannins, are naturally occurring oligomers and polymers of flavan-3-ol monomer units widely found in the leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, nuts and barks of many plants. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) have been used as nutritional supplements, as antioxidants, in preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, and for dislipidemy treatment. The anthracycline antibiotic adriamycin (Doxorubicin, DXR) is a cancer chemotherapeutic agent that interferes with the topoisomerase II enzyme and generates free radicals. In the present study, GSPs (1.680, 3.375, or 6.750 mg/mL) alone were examined for genotoxicity, and combined with DXR (0.125 mg/mL) for antigenotoxicity, using the standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) versions of the wing somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster. The results observed in both crosses were rather similar. GSPs themselves did not show genotoxicity at the doses used. GSPs suppressed the DNA damage induced by DXR in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison of the frequencies of wing spots in the marker-heterozygous (MH) flies and balancer-heterozygous (BH) flies from both crosses, indicated that induced recombination was the major response for the treatments with DXR alone.

Large introns in relation to alternative splicing and gene evolution: a case study of Drosophila bruno-3,19840385,10.1186/1471-2156-10-67,"Background:
      
    

    
      Alternative splicing (AS) of maturing mRNA can generate structurally and functionally distinct transcripts from the same gene. Recent bioinformatic analyses of available genome databases inferred a positive correlation between intron length and AS. To study the interplay between intron length and AS empirically and in more detail, we analyzed the diversity of alternatively spliced transcripts (ASTs) in the Drosophila RNA-binding Bruno-3 (Bru-3) gene. This gene was known to encode thirteen exons separated by introns of diverse sizes, ranging from 71 to 41,973 nucleotides in D. melanogaster. Although Bru-3's structure is expected to be conducive to AS, only two ASTs of this gene were previously described.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Cloning of RT-PCR products of the entire ORF from four species representing three diverged Drosophila lineages provided an evolutionary perspective, high sensitivity, and long-range contiguity of splice choices currently unattainable by high-throughput methods. Consequently, we identified three new exons, a new exon fragment and thirty-three previously unknown ASTs of Bru-3. All exon-skipping events in the gene were mapped to the exons surrounded by introns of at least 800 nucleotides, whereas exons split by introns of less than 250 nucleotides were always spliced contiguously in mRNA. Cases of exon loss and creation during Bru-3 evolution in Drosophila were also localized within large introns. Notably, we identified a true de novo exon gain: exon 8 was created along the lineage of the obscura group from intronic sequence between cryptic splice sites conserved among all Drosophila species surveyed. Exon 8 was included in mature mRNA by the species representing all the major branches of the obscura group. To our knowledge, the origin of exon 8 is the first documented case of exonization of intronic sequence outside vertebrates.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      We found that large introns can promote AS via exon-skipping and exon turnover during evolution likely due to frequent errors in their removal from maturing mRNA. Large introns could be a reservoir of genetic diversity, because they have a greater number of mutable sites than short introns. Taken together, gene structure can constrain and/or promote gene evolution.",2009,"Nikolai P Kandul, Mohamed A F Noor, Nikolai P Kandul, Mohamed A F Noor"
"Separating the spindle, checkpoint, and timer functions of BubR1",19951912,10.1083/jcb.200905026,"BubR1 performs several roles during mitosis, affecting the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), mitotic timing, and spindle function, but the interdependence of these functions is unclear. We have analyzed in Drosophila melanogaster the mitotic phenotypes of kinase-dead (KD) BubR1 and BubR1 lacking the N-terminal KEN box. bubR1-KD individuals have a robust SAC but abnormal spindles with thin kinetochore fibers, suggesting that the kinase activity modulates microtubule capture and/or dynamics but is relatively dispensable for SAC function. In contrast, bubR1-KEN flies have normal spindles but no SAC. Nevertheless, mitotic timing is normal as long as Mad2 is present. Thus, the SAC, timer, and spindle functions of BubR1 are substantially separable. Timing is shorter in bubR1-KEN mad2 double mutants, yet in these flies, lacking both critical SAC components, chromosomes still segregate accurately, reconfirming that in Drosophila, reliable mitosis does not need the SAC.",2009,"Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess, Zohra Rahmani, Mary E Gagou, Christophe Lefebvre, Doruk Emre, Roger E Karess"
Epistatic interactions attenuate mutations affecting startle behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster,19968911,10.1017/S0016672309990279,"Epistasis is an important feature of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. Previously, we showed that startle-induced locomotor behaviour of Drosophila melanogaster, a critical survival trait, is highly polygenic and exhibits epistasis. Here, we characterize epistatic interactions among homozygous P-element mutations affecting startle-induced locomotion in the Canton-S isogenic background and in 21 wild-derived inbred genetic backgrounds. We find pervasive epistasis for pairwise combinations of homozygous P-element insertional mutations as well as for mutations in wild-derived backgrounds. In all cases, the direction of the epistatic effects is to suppress the mutant phenotypes. The magnitude of the epistatic interactions in wild-derived backgrounds is highly correlated with the magnitude of the main effects of mutations, leading to phenotypic robustness of the startle response in the face of deleterious mutations. There is variation in the magnitude of epistasis among the wild-derived genetic backgrounds, indicating evolutionary potential for enhancing or suppressing effects of single mutations. These results provide a partial glimpse of the complex genetic network underlying the genetic architecture of startle behaviour and provide empirical support for the hypothesis that suppressing epistasis is the mechanism underlying genetic canalization of traits under strong stabilizing selection. Widespread suppressing epistasis will lead to underestimates of the main effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in mapping experiments when not explicitly accounted for. In addition, suppressing epistasis could lead to underestimates of mutational variation for quantitative traits and overestimates of the strength of stabilizing selection, which has implications for maintenance of variation of complex traits by mutation-selection balance.",2009,"Akihiko Yamamoto, Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C MacKay, Akihiko Yamamoto, Robert R H Anholt, Trudy F C MacKay"
Genomic imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both mammalian and insect imprinting,19031081,10.1007/s00427-008-0267-3,"Genomic imprinting is a process that marks DNA, causing a change in gene or chromosome behavior, depending on the sex of the transmitting parent. In mammals, most examples of genomic imprinting affect the transcription of individual or small clusters of genes whereas in insects, genomic imprinting tends to silence entire chromosomes. This has been interpreted as evidence of independent evolutionary origins for imprinting. To investigate how these types of imprinting are related, we performed a phenotypic, molecular, and cytological analysis of an imprinted chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of this chromosome reveals that the imprint results in transcriptional silencing. Yet, the domain of transcriptional silencing is very large, extending at least 1.2 Mb and encompassing over 100 genes, and is associated with decreased somatic polytenization of the entire chromosome. We propose that repression of somatic replication in polytenized cells, as a secondary response to the imprint, acts to extend the size of the imprinted domain to an entire chromosome. Thus, imprinting in Drosophila has properties of both typical mammalian and insect imprinting which suggests that genomic imprinting in Drosophila and mammals is not fundamentally different; imprinting is manifest as transcriptional silencing of a few genes or silencing of an entire chromosome depending on secondary processes such as differences in gene density and polytenization.",2009,"Matthew Anaka, Audra Lynn, Patrick McGinn, Vett K Lloyd, Matthew Anaka, Audra Lynn, Patrick McGinn, Vett K Lloyd"
A GFP trap study uncovers the functions of Gilgamesh protein kinase in Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis,19269340,10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.02.009,"The function of the gene gilgamesh (89B9-12) encoding a casein kinase in Drosophila spermatogenesis was studied. The chimeric Gilgamesh-GFP protein in spermatocytes is cortically located. In the polar and apolar spermatocytes, it concentrates at the terminal ends of the fusome, the organelle that passes through the system of ring canals of the spermatocyte cyst. At the stage of spermatid elongation, the protein associates with the nucleus. A spot of the highest Gilgamesh-GFP concentration in the nucleus co-localizes with gamma-tubulin in the basal body. At later stages, Gilgamesh is localized to the individualization complex (IC), leaving the nuclei somewhat before the IC investment cones, as detected by actin binding. The sterile mutation due to the gilgamesh gene leads to the phenotype of scattered nuclei and altered structure of actin cones in the individualizing spermatid cyst. Ultrastructural evidence confirmed defective spermatid individualization due to the mutation.

In this review we will summarize what is known about phospholipase D in several model organisms, including C. elegans, D. discoideum, D. rerio and D. melanogaster. In the cases where knockouts are available (C. elegans, Dictyostelium and Drosophila) the PLD gene(s) appear not to be essential for viability, but several studies are beginning to identify pathways where this activity has a role.

Physiological and molecular characterization of methotrexate transport by Malpighian tubules of adult Drosophila melanogaster,19545574,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2009.06.005,"A radioisotope tracer technique and quantitative PCR were used to study the mechanisms and regulation of transepithelial transport of the type II organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster. Transport of MTX was saturable and Na(+)-independent; the kinetic parameters J(max) and K(t) were 437fmolmin(-1) and 23.5microM, respectively. The transport of MTX was competitively inhibited by phenol red and probenecid; non-competitively inhibited by salicylate, verapamil and MK-571; and uncompetitively inhibited by Texas Red. Dietary exposure to 0.1mM MTX led to dramatic increases in gene expression for several members of the ABC family of transporters in both the Malpighian tubules and the gut. Our results suggest that multiple transporters are upregulated in response to dietary exposure to MTX. Increased levels of the protein products which may result from expression of these genes may enhance elimination of toxic compounds such as MTX or its metabolites.",2009,"Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell, Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell"
Estimation of fine-scale recombination intensity variation in the white-echinus interval of D. melanogaster,19504037,10.1007/s00239-009-9250-5,"Accurate assessment of local recombination rate variation is crucial for understanding the recombination process and for determining the impact of natural selection on linked sites. In Drosophila, local recombination intensity has been estimated primarily by statistical approaches, by estimating the local slope of the relationship between the physical and genetic maps. However, these estimates are limited in resolution and, as a result, the physical scale at which recombination intensity varies in Drosophila is largely unknown. Although there is some evidence suggesting as much as a 40-fold variation in crossover rate at a local scale in D. pseudoobscura, little is known about the fine-scale structure of recombination rate variation in D. melanogaster. Here we experimentally examine the fine-scale distribution of crossover events in a 1.2-Mb region on the D. melanogaster X chromosome using a classic genetic mapping approach. Our results show that crossover frequency is significantly heterogeneous within this region, varying approximately 3.5-fold. Simulations suggest that this degree of heterogeneity is sufficient to affect levels of standing nucleotide diversity, although the magnitude of this effect is small. We recover no statistical association between empirical estimates of nucleotide diversity and recombination intensity, which is likely due to the limited number of loci sampled in our population genetic data set. However, codon bias is significantly negatively correlated with fine-scale recombination intensity estimates, as expected. Our results shed light on the relevant physical scale to consider in evolutionary analyses relating to recombination rate and highlight the motivations to increase the resolution of the recombination map in Drosophila.",2009,"Nadia D Singh, Charles F Aquadro, Andrew G Clark, Nadia D Singh, Charles F Aquadro, Andrew G Clark"
Birth and death of genes and functions in the beta-esterase cluster of Drosophila,19536450,10.1007/s00239-009-9236-3,"Here we analyze the molecular evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster in the Drosophila genus using the recently released genome sequences of 12 Drosophila species. Molecular evolution in this small cluster is noteworthy because it contains contrasting examples of the types and stages of loss of gene function. Specifically, missing orthologs, pseudogenes, and null alleles are all inferred. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest a minimum of 9 gene gain-loss events; however, the exact number and age of these events is confounded by interparalog recombination. A previous enigma, in which allozyme loci were mapped to beta-esterase genes that lacked catalytically essential amino acids, was resolved through the identification of neighbouring genes that contain the canonical catalytic residues and thus presumably encode the mapped allozymes. The originally identified genes are evolving with selective constraint, suggesting that they have a ""noncatalytic"" function. Curiously, 3 of the 4 paralogous beta-esterase genes in the D. ananassae genome sequence have single inactivating (frame-shift or nonsense) mutations. To determine whether these putatively inactivating mutations were fixed, we sequenced other D. ananassae alleles of these four loci. We did not find any of the 3 inactivating mutations of the sequenced strain in 12 other strains; however, other inactivating mutations were observed in the same 3 genes. This is reminiscent of the high frequency of null alleles observed in one of the beta-esterase genes (Est7/EstP) of D. melanogaster.",2009,"Charles Robin, Lisa M J Bardsley, Chris Coppin, John G Oakeshott, Charles Robin, Lisa M J Bardsley, Chris Coppin, John G Oakeshott"

The recent identification and characterization of several mutations affecting growth in Drosophila melanogaster promises to provide insights. Many of these mutations affect the extrinsic control of animal size; others affect the organ-intrinsic control of pattern and size.

Amphiphysins: raising the BAR for synaptic vesicle recycling and membrane dynamics. Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp,12047553,10.1034/j.1600-0854.2002.30702.x,"Amphiphysins, members of the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) protein super family, have been postulated to play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs). This review focuses on recent genetic studies of the role of amphiphysins in SV recycling and membrane morphogenesis. In the mouse, brain-specific amphiphysin I and II regulate, but are not essential for, SV recycling. The role of this regulation appears important, as mice deficient in these proteins have seizures and are deficient in learning and memory. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, amphiphysin is found in muscles and is enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs); however, it does not play a role in SV recycling. Rather, amphiphysin in fly muscles appears to regulate the organization and structure of the muscle T-tubule system and possibly the subsynaptic reticulum. Amphiphysin is also involved in membrane organization in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in Drosophila. These studies reveal pleiotropic functions for amphiphysins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the regulation of membrane dynamics, perhaps through the actin cytoskeleton.",2002,"Bing Zhang, Andrew C Zelhof, Bing Zhang, Andrew C Zelhof"

A genetic analysis of the porin gene encoding a voltage-dependent anion channel protein in Drosophila melanogaster,12207222,10.1007/s00438-002-0714-1,"The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, also known as porin) is an abundant protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane that forms transmembrane channels permeable to solutes. While in mammals at least three different porin genes have been found, only one VDAC-encoding gene, porin, has been described so far in Drosophila melanogaster. It produces transcripts with alternative untranslated sequences. Here we report the identification of two PlacW insertions in the porin gene among a set of P-element insertions that have been mapped to the 32B3-4 region on the second chromosome. Homozygotes, as well as trans-heterozygotes for these insertions, lack VDAC, and die during the late pupal stage. Function can be restored by precise excision of the P transposon, while most deletions in the porin locus, produced by imprecise excisions, display the recessive lethal effect of the original mutant alleles. However, one of the deletions was found to be a hypomorphic male-sterile allele producing low levels of the VDAC protein, indicating that the product of the porin gene is also essential for male fertility. Analysis of the new mutant alleles also showed that the untranslated exon 1B of the porin gene is not required for VDAC synthesis. In the course of our investigation, we found that immediately adjacent to the porin gene are three more genes encoding proteins that share homology with the VDAC protein.

"lingerer, a Drosophila gene involved in initiation and termination of copulation, encodes a set of novel cytoplasmic proteins",12524348,,"In an effort to uncover genetic components underlying the courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, we have characterized a novel gene, lingerer (lig), mutations of which result in abnormal copulation. Males carrying a hypomorphic mutation in lig fail to withdraw their genitalia upon termination of copulation, but display no overt abnormalities in their genitalia. A severe reduction in the dosage of the lig gene causes repeated attempted copulations but no successful copulations. Complete loss of lig function results in lethality during early pupal stages. lig is localized to polytene segment 44A on the second chromosome and encodes three alternatively spliced transcripts that generate two types of 150-kD proteins, Lig-A and Lig-B, differing only at the C terminus. Lig proteins show no similarity to known proteins. However, a set of homologous proteins in mammals suggest that Drosophila Lig belongs to a family of proteins that share five highly conserved domains. Lig is a cytoplasmic protein expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), imaginal discs, and gonads. Lig-A expression is selectively reduced in lig mutants and the ubiquitous supply of this protein at the beginning of metamorphosis restores the copulatory defects of the lig mutant.

      We analyzed conservation in eight genomic regions (apterous, even-skipped, fushi tarazu, twist, and Rhodopsins 1, 2, 3 and 4) from four Drosophila species (D. erecta, D. pseudoobscura, D. willistoni, and D. littoralis) covering more than 500 kb of the D. melanogaster genome. All D. melanogaster genes (and 78-82% of coding exons) identified in divergent species such as D. pseudoobscura show evidence of functional constraint. Addition of a third species can reveal functional constraint in otherwise non-significant pairwise exon comparisons. Microsynteny is largely conserved, with rearrangement breakpoints, novel transposable element insertions, and gene transpositions occurring in similar numbers. Rates of amino-acid substitution are higher in uncharacterized genes relative to genes that have previously been studied. Conserved non-coding sequences (CNCSs) tend to be spatially clustered with conserved spacing between CNCSs, and clusters of CNCSs can be used to predict enhancer sequences.

"Genetic and molecular analysis of region 88E9;88F2 in Drosophila melanogaster, including the ear gene related to human factors involved in lineage-specific leukemias",11901121,,"We identified and characterized the Drosophila gene ear (ENL/AF9-related), which is closely related to mammalian genes that have been implicated in the onset of acute lymphoblastic and myelogenous leukemias when their products are fused as chimeras with those of human HRX, a homolog of Drosophila trithorax. The ear gene product is present in all early embryonic cells, but becomes restricted to specific tissues in late embryogenesis. We mapped the ear gene to cytological region 88E11-13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by Df(3R)ea(5022rx1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant alleles. We carried out a large-scale noncomplementation screen using Df(3R)ea(5022rx1) and chemical (EMS) mutagenesis from which we identified seven novel multi-allele recessive lethal complementation groups in this region. An overlapping deficiency, Df(3R)Po(4), allowed us to map several of these groups to either the proximal or the distal regions of Df(3R)ea(5022rx1). One of these complementation groups likely corresponds to the ear gene as judged by map location, terminal phenotype, and reduction of EAR protein levels.",2002,"Claudia B Zraly, Yun Feng, Andrew K Dingwall, Claudia B Zraly, Yun Feng, Andrew K Dingwall"
The gypsy insulators flanking yellow enhancers do not form a separate transcriptional domain in Drosophila melanogaster: the enhancers can activate an isolated yellow promoter,11973309,,"The best-characterized insulator in Drosophila melanogaster is the Su(Hw)-binding region contained within the gypsy retrotransposon. In the y(2) mutant, Su(Hw) protein partially inhibits yellow transcription by blocking the function of transcriptional enhancers located distally from the yellow promoter with respect to gypsy. Previously we have shown that yellow enhancers can overcome inhibition by a downstream insulator in the y(rh1) allele, when a second gypsy element is located upstream of the enhancers. To understand how two insulators neutralize each other, we isolated various deletions that terminate in the regulatory region of the y(rh1) allele. To generate these alleles we used DNA elongation by gene conversion of the truncated chromosomes at the end of the yellow regulatory region. We found that gypsy insulator can function at the end of the truncated chromosome. Addition of the gypsy insulator upstream of the yellow enhancers overcomes the enhancer-blocking activity of the gypsy insulator inserted between the yellow enhancers and promoter. These results suggest that the gypsy insulators do not form separate transcriptional domains that delimit the interactions between enhancers and promoters.",2002,"Larisa Melnikova, Maria Gause, Pavel Georgiev, Larisa Melnikova, Maria Gause, Pavel Georgiev"
Expression of the Idefix retrotransposon in early follicle cells in the germarium of Drosophila melanogaster is determined by its LTR sequences and a specific genomic context,11976956,10.1007/s00438-002-0641-1,"Retrotransposons are transcriptionally activated in different tissues and cell types by a variety of genomic and environmental factors. Transcription of LTR retrotransposons is controlled by cis-acting regulatory sequences in the 5' LTR. Mobilization of two LTR retroelements, Idefix and ZAM, occurs in the unstable RevI line of Drosophila melanogaster, in which their copy numbers are high, while they are low in all other stocks tested. Here we show that both a full-length and a subgenomic Idefix transcript that are necessary for its mobilization are present in the Rev1 line, but not in the other lines. Studies on transgenic strains demonstrate that the 5' LTR of Idefix contains sequences that direct the tissue-specific expression of the retroelement in testes and ovaries of adult flies. In ovaries, expression occurs in the early follicle and in other somatic cells of the germarium, and is strictly associated with the unstable genetic context conferred by the RevI line. Control of tissue-specific Idefix expression by interactions between cis-acting sequences of its LTR and trans-acting genomic factors provides an opportunity to use this retroelement as a tool for the study of the early follicle cell lineage in the germarium.",2002,"S Tcheressiz, V Calco, F Arnaud, L Arthaud, B Dastugue, C Vaury, S Tcheressiz, V Calco, F Arnaud, L Arthaud, B Dastugue, C Vaury"

Composition of Drosophila melanogaster proteome involved in fucosylated glycan metabolism,11698403,10.1074/jbc.M107927200,"The whole genome approach enables the characterization of all components of any given biological pathway. Moreover, it can help to uncover all the metabolic routes for any molecule. Here we have used the genome of Drosophila melanogaster to search for enzymes involved in the metabolism of fucosylated glycans. Our results suggest that in the fruit fly GDP-fucose, the donor for fucosyltransferase reactions, is formed exclusively via the de novo pathway from GDP-mannose through enzymatic reactions catalyzed by GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose 3,5-epimerase/4-reductase (GMER, also known as FX in man). The Drosophila genome does not have orthologs for the salvage pathway enzymes, i.e. fucokinase and GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase synthesizing GDP-fucose from fucose. In addition we identified two novel fucosyltransferases predicted to catalyze alpha1,3- and alpha1,6-specific linkages to the GlcNAc residues on glycans. No genes with the capacity to encode alpha1,2-specific fucosyltransferases were found. We also identified two novel genes coding for O-fucosyltransferases and a gene responsible for a fucosidase enzyme in the Drosophila genome. Finally, using the Drosophila CG4435 gene, we identified two novel human genes putatively coding for fucosyltransferases. This work can serve as a basis for further whole-genome approaches in mapping all possible glycosylation pathways and as a basic analysis leading to subsequent experimental studies to verify the predictions made in this work.",2002,"Christophe Roos, Meelis Kolmer, Pirkko Mattila, Risto Renkonen, Christophe Roos, Meelis Kolmer, Pirkko Mattila, Risto Renkonen"
Rates of R1 and R2 retrotransposition and elimination from the rDNA locus of Drosophila melanogaster,12399390,,"R1 and R2 elements are non-LTR retrotransposons that insert specifically into the 28S rRNA genes of arthropods. The process of concerted evolution of the rDNA locus should give rise to rapid turnover of these mobile elements compared to elements that insert at sites throughout a genome. To estimate the rate of R1 and R2 turnover we have examined the insertion of new elements and elimination of old elements in the Harwich mutation accumulation lines of Drosophila melanogaster, a set of inbred lines maintained for >350 generations. Nearly 300 new insertion and elimination events were observed in the 19 Harwich lines. The retrotransposition rate for R1 was 18 times higher than the retrotransposition rate for R2. Both rates were within the range previously found for retrotransposons that insert outside the rDNA loci in D. melanogaster. The elimination rates of R1 and R2 from the rDNA locus were similar to each other but over two orders of magnitude higher than that found for other retrotransposons. The high rates of R1 and R2 elimination from the rDNA locus confirm that these elements must maintain relatively high rates of retrotransposition to ensure their continued presence in this locus.",2002,"CÃ©sar E PÃ©rez-GonzÃ¡lez, Thomas H Eickbush, CÃ©sar E PÃ©rez-GonzÃ¡lez, Thomas H Eickbush"
The divergent U12-type spliceosome is required for pre-mRNA splicing and is essential for development in Drosophila,11864616,10.1016/s1097-2765(02)00441-0,"A minor class of pre-mRNA introns whose excision requires a spliceosome containing U11, U12, U4atac/U6atac, and U5 snRNPs has been identified in plants, insects, and vertebrates. We have characterized single loci that specify the U6atac and U12 snRNAs of Drosophila melanogaster. P element-mediated disruptions of the U6atac and U12 genes cause lethality during the third instar larval and embryonic stages, respectively, and are rescued by U6atac and U12 transgenes. The P element disruption of U6atac results in excision defects of U12-type introns from several transcripts including an alternative U12-dependent spliced isoform of prospero, a homeodomain protein required for CNS development. Thus, we demonstrate the requirement for the U12 spliceosome in the development of a metazoan organism.",2002,"Leo R Otake, Petra Scamborova, Carl Hashimoto, Joan A Steitz, Leo R Otake, Petra Scamborova, Carl Hashimoto, Joan A Steitz"

We previously showed that human Aurora-A is turned over through the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The association of two distinct WD40 repeat proteins known as Cdc20 and Cdh1, respectively, sequentially activates the APC/C.

Alteration of the actin cytoskeleton resulting from Dmoesin mutations impairs the localization of maternal determinants, thus disrupting antero-posterior polarity. This study also demonstrates the requirement of Dmoesin for the specific organization of cortical microfilaments in nurse cells and, consequently, mutations in Dmoesin produce severe defects in cell shape.",2002,"CÃ©dric Polesello, Isabelle Delon, Philippe Valenti, Pierre Ferrer, FranÃ§ois Payre, CÃ©dric Polesello, Isabelle Delon, Philippe Valenti, Pierre Ferrer, FranÃ§ois Payre"
Crystal structure of imaginal disc growth factor-2. A member of a new family of growth-promoting glycoproteins from Drosophila melanogaster,11821393,10.1074/jbc.M110502200,"Imaginal disc growth factor-2 (IDGF-2) is a member of a recently described family of Drosophila melanogaster-soluble polypeptide growth factors that promote cell proliferation in imaginal discs. Although their precise mode of action has not been established, IDGFs cooperate with insulin in stimulating the growth of imaginal disc cells. We report the crystal structure of IDGF-2 at 1.3-A resolution. The structure shows the classical (betaalpha)(8) barrel-fold of family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, with an insertion of an alpha + beta domain similar to that of Serratia marcescens chitinases A and B. However, amino acid substitutions in the consensus catalytic sequence of chitinases give IDGF-2 a less negatively charged environment in its putative ligand-binding site and preclude the nucleophilic attack mechanism of chitin hydrolysis. Particularly important is the replacement of Glu by Gln at position 132, which has been shown to abolish enzymatic activity in chitinases. Nevertheless, a modest conservation of residues that participate in oligosaccharide recognition suggests that IDGF-2 could bind carbohydrates, assuming several conformational changes to open the partially occluded binding site. Thus, IDGFs may have evolved from chitinases to acquire new functions as growth factors, interacting with cell surface glycoproteins implicated in growth-promoting processes, such as the Drosophila insulin receptor.",2002,"Paloma F Varela, Andrea S Llera, Roy A Mariuzza, JosÃ© Tormo, Paloma F Varela, Andrea S Llera, Roy A Mariuzza, JosÃ© Tormo"

The effects of three Drosophila melanogaster myotropins on the frequency of foregut contractions differ,12479379,10.1080/01677060213156,"Myotropic peptides can be grouped into different families based on their structure. Three Drosophila melanogaster myotropin families are represented by TDVDHVFLRFamide, dromyosuppressin (DMS), pEVRYRQCYFNPISCF, an allatostatin C-type peptide named flatline (FLT), and SDNFMRFamide, a FMRFamide-containing peptide. The structures of DMS, FLT, and SDNFMRFamide differ and each peptide is encoded by a different gene. In addition, the spatial and temporal distributions of DMS, FLT, and SDNFMRFamide are dissimilar. DMS, FLT, and SDNFMRFamide each decreases heart rate; however, their effects are profoundly different. Likewise, the effects of these three myotropins on the frequency of the spontaneous contractions of the crop, an anterior portion of the foregut, differ. DMS stops crop movement without recovery for at least a 10-min period after applying the peptide, FLT significantly decreases the frequency of spontaneous contractions, but its effect partially reverses within a few minutes after applying the peptide, and SDNFMRFamide only slightly decreased crop motility, an effect that was not significantly different from the effect of saline. The differences in the structures, distributions, and activities of DMS, FLT, and SDNFMRFamide suggest their synthesis and release are under different sensory inputs and regulatory mechanisms, and that roles in affecting the frequency of crop contractions differ.",2002,"Susan Kaminski, Elizabeth Orlowski, Kathleen Berry, Ruthann Nichols, Susan Kaminski, Elizabeth Orlowski, Kathleen Berry, Ruthann Nichols"

Maternal transmission of P element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster depends on the last P intron,12077325,10.1073/pnas.142304199,"Maternal transmission of RNAs or proteins through the egg cytoplasm plays an important role in eukaryotic development. We show that the transposase activity encoded by the P transposable element of Drosophila melanogaster is transmitted through the oocytes of females heterozygous for this element even when these oocytes do not carry the element itself. However, this maternal transmission is abolished when the last of three introns is removed from the P element. These facts imply that maternal transmission of transposase activity involves the RNA transcribed from the P element rather than the polypeptide it encodes, and that to be transmitted maternally, this RNA must possess the last intron. Examination of the intron's sequence reveals that it contains a motif of nine nucleotides that has been implicated in the maternal transmission of developmentally significant RNAs. This same intron limits expression of the P transposase to the germ line of Drosophila. Thus, the last P intron has two important biological functions.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Sarah J Thompson, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Sarah J Thompson"
Evolution of late-life mortality in Drosophila melanogaster,12449485,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00124.x,"Aging appears to cease at late ages, when mortality rates roughly plateau in large-scale demographic studies. This anomalous plateau in late-life mortality has been explained theoretically in two ways: (1) as a strictly demographic result of heterogeneity in life-long robustness between individuals within cohorts, and (2) as an evolutionary result of the plateau in the force of natural selection after the end of reproduction. Here we test the latter theory using cohorts of Drosophila melanogaster cultured with different ages of reproduction for many generations. We show in two independent comparisons that populations that evolve with early truncation of reproduction exhibit earlier onset of mortality-rate plateaus, in conformity with evolutionary theory. In addition, we test two population genetic mechanisms that may be involved in the evolution of late-life mortality: mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy. We test mutation accumulation by crossing genetically divergent, yet demographically identical, populations, testing for hybrid vigor between the hybrid and nonhybrid parental populations. We found no difference between the hybrid and nonhybrid populations in late-life mortality rates, a result that does not support mutation accumulation as a genetic mechanism for late-life mortality, assuming mutations act recessively. Finally, we test antagonistic pleiotropy by returning replicate populations to a much earlier age of last reproduction for a short evolutionary time, testing for a rapid indirect response of late-life mortality rates. The positive results from this test support antagonistic pleiotropy as a genetic mechanism for the evolution of late-life mortality.

The role of cytochrome c in caspase activation in Drosophila melanogaster cells,11901173,10.1083/jcb.200111107,"The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is necessary for the formation of the Apaf-1 apoptosome and subsequent activation of caspase-9 in mammalian cells. However, the role of cytochrome c in caspase activation in Drosophila cells is not well understood. We demonstrate here that cytochrome c remains associated with mitochondria during apoptosis of Drosophila cells and that the initiator caspase DRONC and effector caspase DRICE are activated after various death stimuli without any significant release of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Ectopic expression of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, DEBCL, also fails to show any cytochrome c release from mitochondria. A significant proportion of cellular DRONC and DRICE appears to localize near mitochondria, suggesting that an apoptosome may form in the vicinity of mitochondria in the absence of cytochrome c release. In vitro, DRONC was recruited to a >700-kD complex, similar to the mammalian apoptosome in cell extracts supplemented with cytochrome c and dATP. These results suggest that caspase activation in insects follows a more primitive mechanism that may be the precursor to the caspase activation pathways in mammals.",2002,"Loretta Dorstyn, Stuart Read, Dimitrios Cakouros, Jun R Huh, Bruce A Hay, Sharad Kumar, Loretta Dorstyn, Stuart Read, Dimitrios Cakouros, Jun R Huh, Bruce A Hay, Sharad Kumar"
Unusual genetic architecture of natural variation affecting drug resistance in Drosophila melanogaster,12688659,10.1017/s0016672302005888,"Naturally occurring genetic variation was quantified for survival time of adult Drosophila melanogaster exposed to chronic ingestion of the drugs nicotine, caffeine, dopamine, tyramine and octopamine.

Females tended to be more resistant than males to nicotine and caffeine but sex-by-genotype interactions were also seen for these drugs and for the response to dopamine. An unusual and complex genetic architecture was observed in crosses between lines with different responses to caffeine ingestion. Additive and dominance components were clearly seen from the analysis of F1 individuals, but increased female resistance to caffeine in backcross generations and increased male sensitivity in F2 generations confused the interpretation of possible epistatic contributions.",2002,"Roland Carrillo, Greg Gibson, Roland Carrillo, Greg Gibson"
Microdissection and sequence analysis of pericentric heterochromatin from the Drosophila melanogastermutant Suppressor of Underreplication,12111334,10.1007/s00412-002-0190-8,"In the Suppressor of Underreplication( SuUR) mutant strain of Drosophila melanogaster, the heterochromatin of polytene chromosomes is not underreplicated and, as a consequence, a number of beta-heterochromatic regions acquire a banded structure. The chromocenter does not form in these polytene chromosomes, and heterochromatic regions, normally part of the chromocenter, become accessible to cytological analysis. We generated four genomic DNA libraries from specific heterochromatic regions by microdissection of polytene chromosomes. In situ hybridization of individual libraries onto SuUR polytene chromosomes shows that repetitive DNA sequences spread into the neighboring euchromatic regions. This observation allows the localization of eu-heterochromatin transition zones on polytene chromosomes. We find that genomic scaffolds from the eu-heterochromatin transition zones are enriched in repetitive DNA sequences homologous to those flanking the suppressor of forked gene [ su(f) repeat]. We isolated and sequenced about 300 clones from the heterochromatic DNA libraries obtained. Most of the clones contain repetitive DNA sequences; however, some of the clones have unique DNA sequences shared with parts of unmapped genomic scaffolds.

High-throughput retroviral tagging to identify components of specific signaling pathways in cancer,12185366,10.1038/ng950,"Genetic screens carried out in lower organisms such as yeast, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have revealed many signaling pathways. For example, components of the RAS signaling cascade were identified using a mutant eye phenotype in D. melanogaster as a readout. Screening is usually based on enhancing or suppressing a phenotype by way of a known mutation in a particular signaling pathway. Such in vivo screens have been difficult to carry out in mammals, however, owing to their relatively long generation times and the limited number of animals that can be screened. Here we describe an in vivo mammalian genetic screen used to identify components of pathways contributing to oncogenic transformation. We applied retroviral insertional mutagenesis in Myc transgenic (E mu Myc) mice lacking expression of Pim1 and Pim2 to search for genes that can substitute for Pim1 and Pim2 in lymphomagenesis. We determined the chromosomal positions of 477 retroviral insertion sites (RISs) derived from 38 tumors from E mu Myc Pim1(-/-) Pim2(-/-) mice and 27 tumors from E mu Myc control mice using the Ensembl and Celera annotated mouse genome databases. There were 52 sites occupied by proviruses in more than one tumor. These common insertion sites (CISs) are likely to contain genes contributing to tumorigenesis.

Using the P[wHy] hybrid transposable element to disrupt genes in region 54D-55B in Drosophila melanogaster,12242231,,"Understanding the function of each gene in the genome of a model organism such as Drosophila melanogaster is an important goal. The development of improved methods for uncovering the mutant phenotypes of specific genes can accelerate achievement of this goal. The P[wHy] hybrid transposable element can be used to generate nested sets of precisely mapped deletions in a given region of the Drosophila genome. Here we use the P[wHy] method to generate overlapping, molecularly defined deletions from a set of three P[wHy] insertions in the 54E-F region of chromosome 2. Deletions that span a total of 0.5 Mb were identified and molecularly mapped precisely. Using overlapping deletions, the mutant phenotypes of nine previously uncharacterized genes in a 101-kb region were determined, including identification of new loci required for viability and female fertility. In addition, the deletions were used to molecularly map previously isolated lethal mutations. Thus, the P[wHy] method provides an efficient method for systematically determining the phenotypes of genes in a given region of the fly genome.",2002,"Stephanie E Mohr, William M Gelbart, Stephanie E Mohr, William M Gelbart"
Wolbachia interactions that determine Drosophila melanogaster survival,12449484,10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00123.x,"We have recently described a mutualistic symbiosis in which Wolbachia bacteria were shown to improve the fitness of some Drosophila melanogaster stocks. Wolbachia did not extend longevity in all Drosophila genotypes, even though 16s rDNA sequences indicated that our Drosophila stocks were infected with the same Wolbachia strain. Here, we use reciprocal hybrid crosses between two Drosophila strains, one that lived longer with Wolbachia (Z53) and one that did not (Z2), to investigate the inheritance of the survival phenotype and its dependence on the host genotype, sex, and mating conditions. Wolbachia's positive effects were more apparent in hybrid flies than in parental flies, ruling out exclusive maternal inheritance or the dependence of the survival phenotype on Wolbachia strain differences. The Wolbachia survival effects were more apparent in single-sex cages, where courtship and mating were not permitted. In these cages, nearly all flies with Wolbachia lived longer than uninfected flies, even though strain Z2 showed no Wolbachia effect in mixed-sex mating cages. We used comparisons between single- and mixed-sex cages to estimate the cost of reproduction for both sexes. Our data suggest that Wolbachia infection may increase the inferred cost of reproduction, particularly in males. Wolbachia can even produce a positive survival effect almost as large as the negative survival effect associated with reproduction. We discuss the implications of our experiments for the study of insect symbioses.",2002,"Adam J Fry, David M Rand, Adam J Fry, David M Rand"
The art and design of genetic screens: Drosophila melanogaster,11972155,10.1038/nrg751,"The success of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism is largely due to the power of forward genetic screens to identify the genes that are involved in a biological process.

A Drosophila model of Menkes disease reveals a role for DmATP7 in copper absorption and neurodevelopment,20038716,10.1242/dmm.002642,"Human Menkes disease is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder of copper metabolism that is caused by mutations in the ATP7A copper-transporting gene. In the present study, we attempted to construct a Drosophila model of Menkes disease by RNA interference (RNAi)-induced silencing of DmATP7, the Drosophila orthologue of mammalian ATP7A, in the digestive tract. Here, we show that a lowered level of DmATP7 mRNA in the digestive tract results in a reduced copper content in the head and the rest of the body of surviving adults, presumably owing to copper entrapment in the gut. Similar to Menkes patients, a majority of flies exhibit an impaired neurological development during metamorphosis and die before eclosion. In addition, we show that survival to the adult stage is highly dependent on the copper content of the food and that overexpression of the copper homeostasis gene, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1), enhances survival to the adulthood stage. Taken together, these results highlight the role of DmATP7-mediated copper uptake in the neurodevelopment of Drosophila melanogaster and provide a framework for the analysis of potential gene interactions influencing Menkes disease.",2010,"Sepehr Bahadorani, Peyman Bahadorani, Edyta Marcon, David W Walker, Arthur J Hilliker, Sepehr Bahadorani, Peyman Bahadorani, Edyta Marcon, David W Walker, Arthur J Hilliker"

"Drosophila melanogaster Dis3 N-terminal domains are required for ribonuclease activities, nuclear localization and exosome interactions",20421210,10.1093/nar/gkq295,"Eukaryotic cells use numerous pathways to regulate RNA production, localization and stability. Several of these pathways are controlled by ribonucleases. The essential ribonuclease, Dis3, plays important roles in distinct RNA metabolic pathways. Despite much progress in understanding general characteristics of the Dis3 enzyme in vitro and in vivo, much less is known about the contributions of Dis3 domains to its activities, subcellular localization and protein-protein interactions. To address these gaps, we constructed a set of Drosophila melanogaster Dis3 (dDis3) mutants and assessed their enzymatic activity in vitro and their localizations and interactions in S2 tissue culture cells. We show that the dDis3 N-terminus is sufficient for endoribonuclease activity in vitro and that proper N-terminal domain structure is critical for activity of the full-length polypeptide. We find that the dDis3 N-terminus also contributes to its subcellular distribution, and is necessary and sufficient for interactions with core exosome proteins. Finally, dDis3 interaction with dRrp6 and dImportin-Î±3 is independent of core interactions and occurs though two different regions. Taken together, our data suggest that the dDis3 N-terminus is a dynamic and complex hub for RNA metabolism and exosome interactions.",2010,"Megan Mamolen, Alexandra Smith, Erik D Andrulis, Megan Mamolen, Alexandra Smith, Erik D Andrulis"
"The Drosophila homolog of the mammalian imprint regulator, CTCF, maintains the maternal genomic imprint in Drosophila melanogaster",20673338,10.1186/1741-7007-8-105,"Background:
      
    

    
      CTCF is a versatile zinc finger DNA-binding protein that functions as a highly conserved epigenetic transcriptional regulator. CTCF is known to act as a chromosomal insulator, bind promoter regions, and facilitate long-range chromatin interactions. In mammals, CTCF is active in the regulatory regions of some genes that exhibit genomic imprinting, acting as insulator on only one parental allele to facilitate parent-specific expression. In Drosophila, CTCF acts as a chromatin insulator and is thought to be actively involved in the global organization of the genome.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To determine whether CTCF regulates imprinting in Drosophila, we generated CTCF mutant alleles and assayed gene expression from the imprinted Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome in the presence of reduced CTCF expression. We observed disruption of the maternal imprint when CTCF levels were reduced, but no effect was observed on the paternal imprint. The effect was restricted to maintenance of the imprint and was specific for the Dp(1;f)LJ9 mini-X chromosome.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      CTCF in Drosophila functions in maintaining parent-specific expression from an imprinted domain as it does in mammals. We propose that Drosophila CTCF maintains an insulator boundary on the maternal X chromosome, shielding genes from the imprint-induced silencing that occurs on the paternally inherited X chromosome.

The H3K27me3 demethylase dUTX is a suppressor of Notch- and Rb-dependent tumors in Drosophila,20212086,10.1128/MCB.01633-09,"Trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) is an epigenetic mark for gene silencing and can be demethylated by the JmjC domain of UTX. Excessive H3K27me3 levels can cause tumorigenesis, but little is known about the mechanisms leading to those cancers. Mutants of the Drosophila H3K27me3 demethylase dUTX display some characteristics of Trithorax group mutants and have increased H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Surprisingly, dUTX mutations also affect H3K4me1 levels in a JmjC-independent manner. We show that a disruption of the JmjC domain of dUTX results in a growth advantage for mutant cells over adjacent wild-type tissue due to increased proliferation. The growth advantage of dUTX mutant tissue is caused, at least in part, by increased Notch activity, demonstrating that dUTX is a Notch antagonist. Furthermore, the inactivation of Retinoblastoma (Rbf in Drosophila) contributes to the growth advantage of dUTX mutant tissue. The excessive activation of Notch in dUTX mutant cells leads to tumor-like growth in an Rbf-dependent manner. In summary, these data suggest that dUTX is a suppressor of Notch- and Rbf-dependent tumors in Drosophila melanogaster and may provide a model for UTX-dependent tumorigenesis in humans.",2010,"Hans-Martin Herz, Laurence D Madden, Zhihong Chen, Clare Bolduc, Eugene Buff, Ravi Gupta, Ramana Davuluri, Ali Shilatifard, Iswar K Hariharan, Andreas Bergmann, Hans-Martin Herz, Laurence D Madden, Zhihong Chen, Clare Bolduc, Eugene Buff, Ravi Gupta, Ramana Davuluri, Ali Shilatifard, Iswar K Hariharan, Andreas Bergmann"
Spermidine: a novel autophagy inducer and longevity elixir,20110777,10.4161/auto.6.1.10600,"Spermidine is a ubiquitous polycation that is synthesized from putrescine and serves as a precursor of spermine. Putrescine, spermidine and spermine all are polyamines that participate in multiple known and unknown biological processes. Exogenous supply of spermidine prolongs the life span of several model organisms including yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and significantly reduces age-related oxidative protein damage in mice, indicating that this agent may act as a universal anti-aging drug. Spermidine induces autophagy in cultured yeast and mammalian cells, as well as in nematodes and flies. Genetic inactivation of genes essential for autophagy abolishes the life span-prolonging effect of spermidine in yeast, nematodes and flies. These findings complement expanding evidence that autophagy mediates cytoprotection against a variety of noxious agents and can confer longevity when induced at the whole-organism level.

"Experimentally increased codon bias in the Drosophila Adh gene leads to an increase in larval, but not adult, alcohol dehydrogenase activity",19966063,10.1534/genetics.109.111294,"Although most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codon, the synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency. This phenomenon is known as codon bias and appears to be a universal feature of genomes. The translational selection hypothesis posits that the use of optimal codons, which match the most abundant species of isoaccepting tRNAs, results in increased translational efficiency and accuracy. Previous work demonstrated that the experimental reduction of codon bias in the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene led to a significant decrease in ADH protein expression. In this study we performed the converse experiment: we replaced seven suboptimal leucine codons that occur naturally in the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene with the optimal codon. We then compared the in vivo ADH activities imparted by the wild-type and mutant alleles. The introduction of optimal leucine codons led to an increase in ADH activity in third-instar larvae. In adult flies, however, the introduction of optimal codons led to a decrease in ADH activity. There is no evidence that other selectively constrained features of the Adh gene, or its rate of transcription, were altered by the synonymous replacements. These results are consistent with translational selection for codon bias being stronger in the larval stage and suggest that there may be a selective conflict over optimal codon usage between different developmental stages.",2010,"Winfried Hense, Nathan Anderson, Stephan Hutter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch, David B Carlini, Winfried Hense, Nathan Anderson, Stephan Hutter, Wolfgang Stephan, John Parsch, David B Carlini"

We generated a stable line in the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster, which ectopically expresses Vn50. Results indicated that Vn50 expression accelerates larval development, increases oviposition and reduces melanization in the haemolymph of the transgenic flies. Since melanization is known to be an important facet of the insect immune response, we examined the impact of Vn50 expression on susceptibility to pathogens. Transgenic Vn50 flies challenged with the fungus Beauveria bassiana had increased mortality compared with control flies, but there was no significant change in survival in flies challenged with the pathogenic bacteria, Serratia marcescens. Interestingly, mortality induced by the natural pathogen Drosophila C virus was significantly delayed in Vn50 expressing flies.

Commensal bacteria play a role in mating preference of Drosophila melanogaster,21041648,10.1073/pnas.1009906107,"Development of mating preference is considered to be an early event in speciation. In this study, mating preference was achieved by dividing a population of Drosophila melanogaster and rearing one part on a molasses medium and the other on a starch medium. When the isolated populations were mixed, ""molasses flies"" preferred to mate with other molasses flies and ""starch flies"" preferred to mate with other starch flies. The mating preference appeared after only one generation and was maintained for at least 37 generations. Antibiotic treatment abolished mating preference, suggesting that the fly microbiota was responsible for the phenomenon. This was confirmed by infection experiments with microbiota obtained from the fly media (before antibiotic treatment) as well as with a mixed culture of Lactobacillus species and a pure culture of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from starch flies. Analytical data suggest that symbiotic bacteria can influence mating preference by changing the levels of cuticular hydrocarbon sex pheromones.

      The beta-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) enzymes have been reported in a variety of organisms, but their existence in animals has been unclear. The purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the beta-CAs are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The novel beta-CA gene, here named DmBCA, was identified from FlyBase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of beta-CA sequences in 55 metazoan species. The corresponding recombinant enzyme was produced in Sf9 insect cells, purified, kinetically characterized, and its inhibition was investigated with a series of simple, inorganic anions. Holoenzyme molecular mass was defined by dynamic light scattering analysis and gel filtration, and the results suggested that the holoenzyme is a dimer. Double immunostaining confirmed predictions based on sequence analysis and localized DmBCA protein to mitochondria. The enzyme showed high CO2 hydratase activity, with a kcat of 9.5 x 105 s-1 and a kcat/KM of 1.1 x 108 M-1s-1. DmBCA was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with an inhibition constant of 49 nM. It was moderately inhibited by halides, pseudohalides, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate (KI values of 0.67 - 1.36 mM) and more potently by sulfamide (KI of 0.15 mM). Bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite and phenylarsonic/boronic acids were much weaker inhibitors (KIs of 26.9 - 43.7 mM).

Drosophila TRPA1 channel mediates chemical avoidance in gustatory receptor neurons,20404155,10.1073/pnas.1001425107,"Mammalian sweet, bitter, and umami taste is mediated by a single transduction pathway that includes a phospholipase C (PLC)beta and one cation channel, TRPM5. However, in insects such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, it is unclear whether different tastants, such as bitter compounds, are sensed in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) through one or multiple ion channels, as the cation channels required in insect GRNs are unknown. Here, we set out to explore additional sensory roles for the Drosophila TRPA1 channel, which was known to function in thermosensation. We found that TRPA1 was expressed in GRNs that respond to aversive compounds. Elimination of TRPA1 had no impact on the responses to nearly all bitter compounds tested, including caffeine, quinine, and strychnine. Rather, we found that TRPA1 was required in a subset of avoidance GRNs for the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to aristolochic acid. TRPA1 did not appear to be activated or inhibited directly by aristolochic acid. We found that elimination of the same PLC that leads to activation of TRPA1 in thermosensory neurons was also required in the TRPA1-expressing GRNs for avoiding aristolochic acid. Given that mammalian TRPA1 is required for responding to noxious chemicals, many of which cause pain and injury, our analysis underscores the evolutionarily conserved role for TRPA1 channels in chemical avoidance.",2010,"Sang Hoon Kim, Youngseok Lee, Bradley Akitake, Owen M Woodward, William B Guggino, Craig Montell, Sang Hoon Kim, Youngseok Lee, Bradley Akitake, Owen M Woodward, William B Guggino, Craig Montell"

Thus, mutant pathogens provide a useful tool for dissecting host-pathogen relationships, as the strategies the microbe has evolved to counteract immunity reveal a host's immune mechanisms. In this study, we examined the pathogen Francisella novicida and identified new bacterial virulence factors that interact with different parts of the Drosophila melanogaster innate immune system. We performed a genome-wide screen to identify F. novicida genes required for growth and survival within the fly and identified a set of 149 negatively selected mutants. Among these, we identified a class of genes including the transcription factor oxyR, and the DNA repair proteins uvrB, recB, and ruvC that help F. novicida resist oxidative stress. We determined that these bacterial genes are virulence factors that allow F. novicida to counteract the fly melanization immune response. We then performed a second in vivo screen to identify an additional subset of bacterial genes that interact specifically with the imd signaling pathway. Most of these mutants have decreased resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B. Characterization of a mutation in the putative transglutaminase FTN_0869 produced a curious result that could not easily be explained using known Drosophila immune responses. By using an unbiased genetic screen, these studies provide a new view of the Drosophila immune response from the perspective of a pathogen. We show that two branches of the fly's immunity are important for fighting F. novicida infections in a model host: melanization and an imd-regulated immune response, and identify bacterial genes that specifically counteract these host responses. Our work suggests that there may be more to learn about the fly immune system, as not all of the phenotypes we observe can be readily explained by its interactions with known immune responses.",2010,"Madeleine G Moule, Denise M Monack, David S Schneider, Madeleine G Moule, Denise M Monack, David S Schneider"

Because they transpose by target-primed reverse transcription, each element is oriented so that its 5' end serves as the extreme end of the chromosome until another element transposes to occupy the terminal position. Thus 5' sequences are at risk for terminal erosion while the element is at the chromosome end. Here we report that TART elements in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis show species-specific innovations in promoter architecture that buffer loss of sequence exposed at chromosome ends. The two elements have evolved different ways to effect this protection. The D. virilis TART (TART(vir)) promoter is found in the 3' UTR of the element directly upstream of the element transcribed. Transcription starts within the upstream element so that a ""Tag"" of extra sequence is added to the 5' end of the newly transcribed RNA. This Tag provides expendable sequence to buffer end erosion of essential 5' sequence after the RNA is reverse transcribed onto the chromosome. In contrast, the D. melanogaster TART (TART(mel)) promoter initiates transcription deep within the 5' UTR, but the element is able to replace and extend the 5' UTR sequence by copying sequence from its 3' UTR, we believe while being reverse transcribed onto the chromosome end. Astonishingly, end-protection in TART(vir) and HeT-A(mel) are essentially identical (using Tags), whereas HeT-A(vir) is clearly protected from end erosion by an as-yet-unspecified program.",2010,"Janet A George, Karen L Traverse, P G DeBaryshe, Kerry J Kelley, Mary-Lou Pardue, Janet A George, Karen L Traverse, P G DeBaryshe, Kerry J Kelley, Mary-Lou Pardue"

Both animals show progressive decline in egg production beginning at early middle age, caused in part by reduction in germline stem cell proliferation as well as in survival of developing eggs. Molecular genetic analysis reveals that insulin and TGF-beta signaling are regulators of germline stem cell maintenance and proliferation during aging. Furthermore, the lifespan of both C. elegans and D. melanogaster appears to be regulated by signaling that depends on the presence of germline stem cells in the adult gonad. These invertebrate models provide powerful tools to dissect conserved causes of reproductive aging.",2010,"Marc Tatar, Marc Tatar"

In mammals, BBI influences cellular energy metabolism. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that dietary BBI affects energy-associated pathways in the D. melanogaster midgut. Through microarray and metabolomic analyses, we show that dietary BBI affects energy utilization pathways in the midgut cells of D. melanogaster.

During the last decade, many fly models of neurodegenerative disorders have contributed to the identification of novel pathways mediating pathogenesis. However, the development of prion disease models in flies has been remarkably challenging. We recently reported a Drosophila model of sporadic prion pathology that shares relevant features with the typical disease in mammals.

"Crystal structure and substrate specificity of Drosophila 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase",20098687,10.1371/journal.pone.0008826,"Background:
      
    

    
      3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC), also known as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, catalyzes the decarboxylation of a number of aromatic L-amino acids. Physiologically, DDC is responsible for the production of dopamine and serotonin through the decarboxylation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5-hydroxytryptophan, respectively. In insects, both dopamine and serotonin serve as classical neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, or neurohormones, and dopamine is also involved in insect cuticle formation, eggshell hardening, and immune responses.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      In this study, we expressed a typical DDC enzyme from Drosophila melanogaster, critically analyzed its substrate specificity and biochemical properties, determined its crystal structure at 1.75 Angstrom resolution, and evaluated the roles residues T82 and H192 play in substrate binding and enzyme catalysis through site-directed mutagenesis of the enzyme. Our results establish that this DDC functions exclusively on the production of dopamine and serotonin, with no activity to tyrosine or tryptophan and catalyzes the formation of serotonin more efficiently than dopamine.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The crystal structure of Drosophila DDC and the site-directed mutagenesis study of the enzyme demonstrate that T82 is involved in substrate binding and that H192 is used not only for substrate interaction, but for cofactor binding of drDDC as well. Through comparative analysis, the results also provide insight into the structure-function relationship of other insect DDC-like proteins.",2010,"Qian Han, Haizhen Ding, Howard Robinson, Bruce M Christensen, Jianyong Li, Qian Han, Haizhen Ding, Howard Robinson, Bruce M Christensen, Jianyong Li"
A novel conserved phosphotyrosine motif in the Drosophila fibroblast growth factor signaling adaptor Dof with a redundant role in signal transmission,20154139,10.1128/MCB.01436-09,"The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signals through adaptors constitutively associated with the receptor. In Drosophila melanogaster, the FGFR-specific adaptor protein Downstream-of-FGFR (Dof) becomes phosphorylated upon receptor activation at several tyrosine residues, one of which recruits Corkscrew (Csw), the Drosophila homolog of SHP2, which provides a molecular link to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. However, the Csw pathway is not the only link from Dof to MAPK. In this study, we identify a novel phosphotyrosine motif present in four copies in Dof and also found in other insect and vertebrate signaling molecules. We show that these motifs are phosphorylated and contribute to FGF signal transduction. They constitute one of three sets of phosphotyrosines that act redundantly in signal transmission: (i) a Csw binding site, (ii) four consensus Grb2 recognition sites, and (iii) four novel tyrosine motifs. We show that Src64B binds to Dof and that Src kinases contribute to FGFR-dependent MAPK activation. Phosphorylation of the novel tyrosine motifs is required for the interaction of Dof with Src64B. Thus, Src64B recruitment to Dof through the novel phosphosites can provide a new link to MAPK activation and other cellular responses. This may give a molecular explanation for the involvement of Src kinases in FGF-dependent developmental events.",2010,"Agnes Csiszar, Elisabeth Vogelsang, Hartmut Beug, Maria Leptin, Agnes Csiszar, Elisabeth Vogelsang, Hartmut Beug, Maria Leptin"

Larvae fed on standard Drosophila food mixed with benzene, toluene, and Xylene for 48 h were homogenized in Milli-Q water. Extraction of benzene, toluene, and Xylene was performed at 65 degrees C for 30 min on the SPME fiber (silica-fused). Subsequently, the fiber was desorbed in the GC injection port, followed by GC/MS analysis in the selected-ion monitoring mode. An external calibration curve was used for the quantification of benzene, toluene, and Xylene in the exposed organism. Recoveries were in the range of 78-82% (intraday) and 76-81% (interday) in larvae, and 91-96% (intraday) and 87-92% (interday) in the diet. LOD with an S/N of 3:1 and LOQ with an S/N of 10:1 were in the range of 0.01-0.023 and 0.034-0.077 microg/L, respectively.

Subunits of the Drosophila CCR4-NOT complex and their roles in mRNA deadenylation,20504953,10.1261/rna.2145110,"The CCR4-NOT complex is the main enzyme catalyzing the deadenylation of mRNA.

The CCR4, CAF1 (=POP2), NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, and CAF40 subunits were associated in a stable complex, but NOT4 was not. Factors known to be involved in mRNA regulation were prominent among the other proteins coprecipitated with the CCR4-NOT complex, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The complex was localized mostly in the cytoplasm but did not appear to be a major component of P bodies. Of the known CCR4 paralogs, Nocturnin was found associated with the subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, whereas Angel and 3635 were not. RNAi experiments in Schneider cells showed that CAF1, NOT1, NOT2, and NOT3 are required for bulk poly(A) shortening and hsp70 mRNA deadenylation, but knock-down of CCR4, CAF40, and NOT4 did not affect these processes. Overexpression of catalytically dead CAF1 had a dominant-negative effect on mRNA decay. In contrast, overexpression of inactive CCR4 had no effect. We conclude that CAF1 is the major catalytically important subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex in Drosophila Schneider cells.

We investigated whether the alteration of pheromonal perception is a consequence of the altered production of pheromones or if the two phenotypes are independently controlled by the same locus. Using several genetic tools, we were able to separately manipulate the two pheromonal phenotypes, implying that desat1 is the sole gene responsible, exerting a pleiotropic effect on both transmission and detection. The levels of the five desat1 trancripts, measured in the head and body of manipulated flies, were related to variation in pheromone production. This suggests that the pleiotropic action of desat1 on pheromonal communication depends on the fine regulation of its transcriptional activity.",2010,"Benjamin Houot, FranÃ§ois Bousquet, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Benjamin Houot, FranÃ§ois Bousquet, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur"

In no case, however, have intermediate measures of immune function, such as transcriptional activity of immune-related genes, been tested as mediators of phenotypic variation in immunity. In this study, we measured bacterial load sustained after infection of D. melanogaster with Serratia marcescens, Providencia rettgeri, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactococcus lactis in a panel of 94 third-chromosome substitution lines. We also measured transcriptional levels of 329 immune-related genes eight hours after infection with E. faecalis and S. marcescens in lines from the phenotypic tails of the test panel. We genotyped the substitution lines at 137 polymorphic markers distributed across 25 genes in order to test for statistical associations among genotype, bacterial load, and transcriptional dynamics. We find that genetic polymorphisms in the pathogen recognition genes (and particularly in PGRP-LC, GNBP1, and GNBP2) are most significantly associated with variation in bacterial load. We also find that overall transcriptional induction of effector proteins is a significant predictor of bacterial load after infection with E. faecalis, and that a marker upstream of the recognition gene PGRP-SD is statistically associated with variation in both bacterial load and transcriptional induction of effector proteins.

Although Wari does not contain binding sites for known insulator proteins, the E(y)2 and CP190 proteins bind to Wari as well as to the Su(Hw)-containing insulators in vivo. It may well be that these proteins are recruited to the insulator by as yet unidentified DNA-binding protein.

Functional conservation of human Spastin in a Drosophila model of autosomal dominant-hereditary spastic paraplegia,20154342,10.1093/hmg/ddq064,"Mutations in spastin are the most frequent cause of the neurodegenerative disease autosomal dominant-hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP). Drosophila melanogaster lacking spastin exhibit striking behavioral similarities to human patients suffering from AD-HSP, suggesting conservation of Spastin function between the species. Consistent with this, we show that exogenous expression of wild-type Drosophila or human spastin rescues behavioral and cellular defects in spastin null flies equivalently. This enabled us to generate genetically representative models of AD-HSP, which arises from dominant mutations in spastin rather than a complete loss of the gene. Flies co-expressing one copy of wild-type human spastin and one encoding the K388R catalytic domain mutation in the fly spastin null background, exhibit aberrant distal synapse morphology and microtubule distribution, similar to but less severe than spastin nulls. R388 or a separate nonsense mutation act dominantly and are furthermore sufficient to confer partial rescue, supporting in vitro evidence for additional, non-catalytic Spastin functions. Using this model, we tested the observation from human pedigrees that S44L and P45Q are trans-acting modifiers of mutations affecting the Spastin catalytic domain. As in humans, both L44 and Q45 are largely silent when heterozygous, but exacerbate mutant phenotypes when expressed in trans with R388. These transgenic 'AD-HSP' flies therefore provide a powerful and tractable model to enhance our understanding of the cellular and behavioral consequences of human spastin mutations and test hypotheses directly relevant to the human disease.",2010,"Fang Du, Emily F Ozdowski, Ingrid K Kotowski, Douglas A Marchuk, Nina Tang Sherwood, Fang Du, Emily F Ozdowski, Ingrid K Kotowski, Douglas A Marchuk, Nina Tang Sherwood"

The shaping of male courtship posture by lateralized gustatory inputs to male-specific interneurons,20036540,10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.038,"Background:
      
    

    
      Unilateral wing vibration to generate ""love songs"" is a hallmark of male courtship posture in Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast, males of some other Drosophila species extend both wings simultaneously during courtship. Thus, the patterns of wing movement vary among species and are under stringent genetic control, although there are few variations among individuals within a single species. These observations prompted the postulation that the proper wing display by courting males of D. melanogaster does not require sensory inputs.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we show that when males of D. melanogaster are deprived of gustatory inputs mediated by the sensory neurons expressing the taste receptor gene Gr32a, a close relative to the pheromone receptor gene Gr68a, they often fail to perform unilateral wing extension during courtship because they become unable to keep a wing in the resting position while extending another wing. The tarsal amputation of a foreleg, but not other legs, increased the occurrence of simultaneous wing extension, indicating that Gr32a-expressing cells in this structure are involved in the regulation of courting posture. A similar simultaneous wing extension was also observed in males in which the putative pheromone-binding protein gene Obp57d was inactivated. The axons of Gr32a-expressing cells project to the subesophageal ganglion, where their terminals unilaterally contact mAL, which are male-specific fruitless (fru)-expressing interneurons that have bilateral branches.

"Identification of a gene, Desiccate, contributing to desiccation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster",20937803,10.1074/jbc.M110.168864,"Suitable alterations in gene expression are believed to allow animals to survive drastic changes in environmental conditions. Drosophila melanogaster larvae cease eating and exit moist food to search for dry pupation sites after the foraging stage in what is known as the wandering stage. Although the behavioral change from foraging to wandering causes desiccation stress, the mechanism by which Drosophila larvae protect themselves from desiccation remains obscure. Here, we identified a gene, CG14686 (designated as Desiccate (Desi)), whose expression was elevated during the wandering stage. The Desi expression level was reversibly decreased by transferring wandering larvae to wet conditions and increased again by transferring them to dry conditions. Elevation of Desi expression was also observed in foraging larvae when they were placed in dry conditions. Desi encoded a 261-amino acid single-pass transmembrane protein with notable motifs, such as SH2 and PDZ domain-binding motifs and a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation motif, in the cytoplasmic region, and its expression was observed mainly in the epidermal cells of the larval integuments. Overexpression of Desi slightly increased the larval resistance to desiccation stress during the second instar. Furthermore, Desi RNAi larvae lost more weight under dry conditions, and subsequently, their mortalities significantly increased compared with control larvae. Under dry conditions, consumption of carbohydrate was much higher in Desi RNAi larvae than control larvae. Based on these results, it is reasonable to conclude that Desi contributes to the resistance of Drosophila larvae to desiccation stress.",2010,"Takeshi Kawano, Masami Shimoda, Hitoshi Matsumoto, Masasuke Ryuda, Seiji Tsuzuki, Yoichi Hayakawa, Takeshi Kawano, Masami Shimoda, Hitoshi Matsumoto, Masasuke Ryuda, Seiji Tsuzuki, Yoichi Hayakawa"

Three regions of the hsp26 gene (nucleotides -351 to -135, -135 to -85, and +11 to +632) were able to stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression when fused with promoter sequences (nucleotides -85 to +11) that alone were insufficient to stimulate expression. These stimulatory regions appear to contain elements that provide redundant functions. While each region was able to stimulate expression independently, the deletion of any one region from a construct was without consequence as long as another compensatory region(s) was still present. There must reside, at a minimum, two independent spermatocyte-specifying elements within the sequences that encompass the three stimulatory regions and the promoter. At least one element is contained within sequences from -351 to -48. This region, in either orientation, can stimulate spermatocyte-specific expression from a heterologous promoter. A second element must reside in sequences from -52 to +632, since these sequences are also sufficient to direct spermatocyte-specific expression.",1990,"R L Glaser, J T Lis, R L Glaser, J T Lis"
Transcription at the ecdysone-inducible locus 2B5 in Drosophila,2106669,10.1093/nar/18.3.539,"The Broad-Complex (BR-C) of D. melanogaster, mapping at the 2B5 early ecdysone puff, mediates ecdysone-induced processes. We present here the transcriptional analysis of the locus in both wild type and representative mutants. Two well defined regions are transcribed, only one of which has a pattern consistent with the proposed 2B5 located BR-C function. The 2B5 region is actively transcribed in early third instar larvae before ecdysone levels increase. Ecdysone switches this early pattern to a complex late type which requires the presence of functional BR-C product. Therefore, BR-C self-regulates its own ecdysone-induced transcription. The effect of 2B5 mutations on transcription at several intermolt, early and late puffs is also described. Null mutations at the 2B5 locus prevents ecdysone inducible transcription. This evidence supports the fact that 2B5 codes for an ecdysone-dependent transcriptional regulator.",1990,"J GalcerÃ¡n, J Llanos, J Sampedro, O Pongs, M Izquierdo, J GalcerÃ¡n, J Llanos, J Sampedro, O Pongs, M Izquierdo"
Comparative developmental physiology and molecular cytology of the polytrophic ovarian follicles of the blowfly Sarcophaga bullata and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster,1976473,10.1016/0300-9629(90)90698-r,"1. The ovarian follicles of Sarcophaga and Drosophila consist of one oocyte and 15 nurse cells, the whole being surrounded by follicle cells. Although oocyte and nurse cells are genetically identical sibling cells, and although they are interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges, their physiology is very different. 2. The DNA content of the oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle) never exceeds 4C, while values of polyploidisation up to 1024C have been measured in the nurse cells, this being dependent on their position within a follicle. 3. The nurse cell nuclei very actively synthesize RNA, while the germinal vesicle is almost completely inactive in this respect. 4. It has been possible to visualise the major cytoskeletal elements in the different ovarian cell types. Cellular markers of polarity and dorsoventral asymmetry have been described. 5. Electrophysiological measurements have been performed to find out whether or not the self-electrophoresis principle may be involved in polarised transport between nurse cells and oocyte. 6. Most of the vitellogenin is synthesized by the fat body but some follicle cells also synthesize small amounts. 7. The role of 20-OH ecdysone in the induction of vitellogenin synthesis in the fat body, as well as the presence of met-enkephalin like immunoreactivity in the gonads is well established in both species. Not so clear is the exact role of juvenile hormones and the nature of brain factors controlling ovarian development. 8. Drosophila has the advantage of its well documented genetics while the larger species Sarcophaga is preferable for the study of (electro-) physiological and cell biological mechanisms.",1990,"A De Loof, J Geysen, J Cardoen, B Verachtert, A De Loof, J Geysen, J Cardoen, B Verachtert"
Abnormal genetic segregation associated with the presence of a Y. w+ chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster,2128292,10.1139/g90-132,"We have observed an abnormal genetic segregation in the progeny of crosses between males of the F71 (y wa/Y.w+) strain and females of various strains carrying marker mutations on their chromosome 2. The Y.w+ chromosome, previously described as possibly being associated with a translocation of the 22D region of chromosome 2, was shown to carry the 21A1-22E4 tip of the 2L chromosome. One chromosome 2 of F71 had a deletion of this region. The abnormal genetic segregation observed in the progeny of different crosses can be explained both by the partial lethality (which becomes severe in some homogeneous genetic backgrounds) due to trisomy of the 21A1-22E4 chromosome 2 fragment and by the lethality associated with monosomy of this 21A1-22E4 segment.",1990,"M Rosenberg-Bourgin, A Bracone, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, S Paumard, G Contesse, M Rosenberg-Bourgin, A Bracone, F Lemeunier, S Aulard, S Paumard, G Contesse"
On the origins of tandemly repeated genes: does histone gene copy number in Drosophila reflect chromosomal location?,2113451,10.1007/BF01735327,"Widely regarded beliefs about Drosophila histone gene copy numbers and developmental requirements have been generalized from fairly limited data since studies on histone gene arrangements and copy numbers have been largely confined to a single species, D. melanogaster. Histone gene copy numbers and chromosomal locations were examined in three species: D. melangaster, D. hydei and D. hawaiiensis. Quantitative whole genome blot analysis of DNA from diploid tissues revealed a tenfold variability in histone gene copy numbers for these three species. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes showed that the histone DNA (hDNA) chromosomal location is different in all three species. These observations lead us to propose a relationship between histone gene reiteration and chromosomal position.",1990,"D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh, V Barrett, D H Fitch, L D Strausbaugh, V Barrett"
Transcription of a satellite DNA on two Y chromosome loops of Drosophila melanogaster,2119983,10.1007/BF01731701,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster exhibit three giant lampbrush-like loops formed by the kl-5, kl-3 and ks-1 Y chromosome fertility factors. Detailed mapping of satellite DNA sequences along the Y chromosome has recently shown that AA-GAC satellite repeats are a significant component of the kl-5 and ks-1 loop-forming regions. To determine whether these simple repeated sequences are transcribed on the loop structures we performed a series of DNA-RNA in situ hybridization experiments to fixed loop preparations using as a probe cloned AAGAC repeats. These experiments showed that the probe hybridizes with homologous transcripts specifically associated with the kl-5 and ks-1 loops. These transcripts are detected at all stages of development of these two loops, do not appear to migrate to the cytoplasm and are degraded when loops disintegrate during the first meiotic prophase. Moreover, an examination of the testes revealed that the transcription of the AAGAC sequences is restricted to the loops of primary spermatocytes; the other cell types of D. melanogaster spermatogenesis do not exhibit nuclear or cytoplasmic labeling. These experiments were confirmed by RNA blotting analysis which showed that transcription of the AAGAC sequences occurs in wild-type testes but not in X/O testes. The patterns of hybridization to the RNA blots indicated that the transcripts are highly heterogeneous in size, from large (migration at limiting mobility) to less than 1 kb. We discuss the possible function of the AAGAC satellite transcripts, in the light of the available information on the Y chromosome loops of D. melanogaster.",1990,"S Bonaccorsi, M Gatti, C Pisano, A Lohe, S Bonaccorsi, M Gatti, C Pisano, A Lohe"
copia expression is variable among natural populations of Drosophila,1700962,,"A survey of copia (retroviral-like element) expression in flies representing 37 populations worldwide of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Drosophila mauritiana demonstrates that, although copia elements are present in all three species, copia-encoded transcripts are detectable only in D. melanogaster. Levels of copia transcripts vary nearly 100-fold among flies representing geographically diverse populations of D. melanogaster and this variation is not correlated with variability in copia copy number. Analysis of transcript levels in interpopulation hybrids demonstrates that much of this variability may be attributable to the action of trans-acting controls. The geographic and phylogenetic pattern of copia expression suggests that moderate to high levels of copia expression may be a relatively recent evolutionary acquisition. The potential evolutionary significance of these findings is discussed.",1990,"A K Csink, J F McDonald"
The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster contains a novel charged adipokinetic-hormone-family peptide,2117437,10.1042/bj2690315,"A member of the RPCH/AKH (red-pigment-concentrating hormone/adipokinetic hormone) family of arthropod neuropeptides was identified in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, and its structure was determined by automated Edman degradation and m.s. using fast-atom-bombardment ionization and a tandem hybrid instrument capable of high sensitivity. The sequence of this peptide, which we call 'DAKH', is pGlu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asp-Trp-NH2 (where pGlu is pyroglutamic acid and Trp-NH2 is tryptophan carboxyamide). H.p.l.c. analyses of extracts of the three body segments revealed that more than 80% of the peptide is contained in the thorax. Although DAKH is typical of family members in its general structure and distribution in the animal, it is unique in containing a residue which is charged under physiological conditions.

"Two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster. Cloning, characterization, and differential expression in development",2141610,,"The annexins are a family of homologous Ca2(+)- and phospholipid-binding proteins that until now have only been found in vertebrates. cDNA clones encoding two novel annexins from Drosophila melanogaster were isolated and characterized. RNA blots indicate that the messages for the two Drosophila proteins are differentially expressed in development, with one message being expressed throughout development, while the other is only found in early embryos and adult flies. In situ hybridizations localize the two Drosophila genes to 93B and 19A-4,7. A similarly high degree of homology relates Drosophila annexins to different vertebrate annexins, indicating that the Drosophila annexins are not the invertebrate homologues of particular mammalian annexins but that they constitute novel members of the annexin gene family. In continuation with a recently established terminology, the Drosophila annexins will be named annexins IX and X. The biochemical properties of Drosophila annexin X were investigated using recombinant protein. Similar to vertebrate annexins, annexin X bound to liver membranes and liposomes containing phosphatidylserine in a calcium-dependent manner but not to liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine. In addition, annexin X partitioned into the detergent phase of Triton X-114 as a function of calcium. The conservation of the annexin family of Ca2(+)-binding proteins in invertebrates suggests that they have a basic function in cells which is not peculiar to vertebrate biology, and the availability of the Drosophila sequences will open avenues for mutational studies of these functions.",1990,"P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C SÃ¼dhof, P A Johnston, M S Perin, G A Reynolds, S A Wasserman, T C SÃ¼dhof"
Molecular analysis of evolutionary changes in the expression of Drosophila esterases,1700427,10.1073/pnas.87.21.8217,"Drosophila melanogaster transformed with the esterase 5 (Est-5) gene from Drosophila pseudoobscura were used to assess the evolutionary basis for differences in the sex- and tissue-specific expression of the esterase 5 (EST 5) enzyme in D. pseudoobscura relative to its homologue in D. melanogaster, EST 6. EST 5 is expressed in the eyes and hemolymph of transformed D. melanogaster just as it is in D. pseudoobscura, but it is not detectable in the ejaculatory duct, where the homologous enzyme, EST 6, is most abundant. EST 5 also occurs at equal levels in both sexes of the transformants and D. pseudoobscura, whereas EST 6 is more abundant in male than in female D. melanogaster. Northern analysis of transformed and untransformed flies indicates that the expression patterns of EST 5 and EST 6 are controlled at the level of transcription and suggests that regulatory differences between Est-6 and Est-5 have evolved mainly through cis-acting regulatory changes in the two loci rather than through alterations in trans-acting factors. Equal expression of EST 5 in male and female transformants also indicates that the X-chromosome-linked Est-5 gene of D. pseudoobscura, when isolated as a 4.5-kilobase restriction fragment, is not dosage compensated after integration into an autosome of D. melanogaster.",1990,"J P Brady, R C Richmond"
Immunolocalization of G protein alpha-subunits in the Drosophila CNS,2108229,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-03-01014.1990,"In order to uncover the role of G proteins in the integrative functioning and development of the nervous system, we have begun a multidisciplinary study of the G proteins present in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In this report, we describe the distribution of 3 different G protein alpha-subunits in the adult Drosophila CNS as determined by immunocytochemical localization using affinity-purified antibodies generated to synthetic oligopeptide sequences unique to each alpha-subunit. Western blot analysis of membranes prepared from Drosophila heads indicates that antibodies specific for the Drosophila Go alpha and Gs alpha homologs recognize the appropriate protein species predicted by molecular cloning (Quan et al., 1989; Thambi et al., 1989). The Gi alpha homolog could not be detected in head membranes by Western blotting, consistent with the negligible levels of expression observed for Gi alpha on Northern blots of head mRNA (Provost et al., 1988). However, a Drosophila Gi alpha fusion protein could be detected by these antibodies following expression in E. coli. Immunolocalization studies revealed that the Go alpha and Gs alpha homologs are expressed at highest levels in neuropils and at intermediate levels in the cortex of all brain and thoracic ganglion areas. Only the lamina contained low levels of these alpha-subunits in the CNS. Additionally, Gs alpha appears to be associated with the cell membranes of neuronal cell bodies, while Go alpha has a more diffuse distribution, suggesting its presence in the cytoplasm as well as cell membranes. In contrast to the wide distribution of Go alpha and Gs alpha, Gi alpha has a surprisingly restricted distribution in the CNS. It is present at high levels only in photoreceptor cell terminations, glomerulae of the antennal lobes, and the ocellar retina. Little or no Gi alpha was detected in other brain regions or in the thoracic ganglion. Gi alpha, then, appears to be uniquely associated with some primary sensory afferents and their terminations, suggesting the presence of specific receptor and/or effector systems which mediate the transmission of primary sensory information in Drosophila.",1990,"W J Wolfgang, F Quan, P Goldsmith, C Unson, A Spiegel, M Forte, W J Wolfgang, F Quan, P Goldsmith, C Unson, A Spiegel, M Forte"

A derived Y chromosome (BsYK) induced a reduction of the recombination frequency in only one of five comparative experiments of XXBsYK and XX females. In two of the tests there was a higher frequency of recombination in the presence of the BsYK.

"Temporal and spatial coordination of chromosome movement, spindle formation, and nuclear envelope breakdown during prometaphase in Drosophila melanogaster embryos",2125300,10.1083/jcb.111.6.2815,"The spatial and temporal dynamics of diploid chromosome organization, microtubule arrangement, and the state of the nuclear envelope have been analyzed in syncytial blastoderm embryos of Drosophila melanogaster during the transition from prophase to metaphase, by three-dimensional optical sectioning microscopy. Time-lapse, three-dimensional data recorded in living embryos revealed that congression of chromosomes (the process whereby chromosomes move to form the metaphase plate) at prometaphase occurs as a wave, starting at the top of the nucleus near the embryo surface and proceeding through the nucleus to the bottom. The time-lapse analysis was augmented by a high-resolution analysis of fixed embryos where it was possible to unambiguously trace the three-dimensional paths of individual chromosomes. In prophase, the centromeres were found to be clustered at the top of the nucleus while the telomeres were situated at the bottom of the nucleus or towards the embryo interior. This polarized centromere-telomere orientation, perpendicular to the embryo surface, was preserved during the process of prometaphase chromosome congression. Correspondingly, breakdown of the nuclear envelope started at the top of the nucleus with the mitotic spindle being formed at the positions of the partial breakdown of the nuclear envelope.

Further, interactions between the maternal effect locus female sterile homeotic (fsh) and trx have been observed. To aid in a molecular analysis of trx function, we have cloned the locus by a P-element transposon tagging approach. Five insertion mutations have been mapped within a region of about 10 kilobases; one of these mutations reverted coincident with the loss of the insertion. Transcription mapping suggests that two RNAs of about 12 and 15 kilobases are the major transcripts of the trx locus and that the transcription unit comprises a region of about 25 kilobases. Transcripts from the trx locus are distributed uniformly in early embryos, but at 14-16 hr after fertilization the ventral nerve cord contains a higher concentration of trx RNA than other regions of the embryo.",1989,"B A Mozer, I B Dawid, B A Mozer, I B Dawid"
Development of adult sensilla on the wing and notum of Drosophila melanogaster,2517255,,"We have investigated the temporal pattern of appearance, cell lineage, and cytodifferentiation of selected sensory organs (sensilla) of adult Drosophila. This analysis was facilitated by the discovery that the monoclonal antibody 22C10 labels not only the neuron of the developing sensillum organ, but the accessory cells as well. The precursors of the macrochaetes and the recurved (chemosensory) bristles of the wing margin divide around and shortly after puparium formation, while those of the microchaetes and the stout and slender (mechanosensory) bristles of the wing margin divide between 9 h and 18 h after puparium formation (apf). The onset of sensillum differentiation follows the terminal precursor division within a few hours. Four of the cells in an individual microchaete organ are clonally related: A single first-order precursor cell divides to produce two second-order precursors; one of these divides into the neuron and thecogen cell, the other into the trichogen cell and tormogen cell. Along the anterior wing margin, two rounds of division generate the cells of the mechanosensory sensilla; here, no strict clonal relationship seems to exist between the cells of an individual sensillum. At the time of sensillum precursor division, many other, non-sensillum-producing cells within the notum and wing proliferate as well.

Mobile genetic elements in Drosophila melanogaster (recent experiments),2561113,10.1139/g89-163,"Recent data obtained in the authors' laboratories concerning the behaviour of mobile genetic elements of Drosophila melanogaster are reviewed.

Transcription is initiated from the +1 nucleotide of jockey and depends on an internal promoter. This is the first case of an internal promoter being used by RNA polymerase II. Several events which take place during the transposition bursts in ctMR2 family of strains were described. Among them are the removal of mobile dispersed genetics (mdg) elements (with solo long terminal repeat (LTR) remaining at the site of excision), complete removal of an mdg element, and reinsertion of the same mdg to the same place either in the presence or in absence of solo LTR sequence. Finally, the formation of deletions was observed. A 462-bp deletion destroying the white locus can be further repaired (w+ reversion). Thus, transposition bursts include many different genetic events. A novel system of prolonged genome destabilization was described. It depends on mobilization of a new mobile element called Stalker. After certain crosses Stalker actively moves for dozens of generations giving rise to large numbers of insertion mutations. Several novel genes were detected using mobilized Stalker.

Formation of joint DNA molecules by two eukaryotic strand exchange proteins does not require melting of a DNA duplex,2538473,,"We have examined whether DNA strand exchange activities from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells or Drosophila melanogaster embryos have detectable helicase or melting activities. The partially purified recombinases have been shown to recognize homologous single strand and double strand DNA molecules and form joint molecules in a DNA strand exchange reaction. The joint molecule product consists of a linear duplex joined at one end by a region of DNA heteroduplex to a homologous single strand circular DNA. Using two different partially duplex helicase substrates, we are unable to detect any melting of duplex regions under conditions that promote joint molecule formation. One substrate consists of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 20 or 30 bases long annealed to M13mp18 circular single strand DNA. The second substrate consists of a linear single strand region flanked at each end by short duplex regions. We observe that even in the presence of excess recombinase protein or after prolonged incubation no helicase activity is apparent. Control experiments rule out the possibility that a helicase is masked by reannealing of displaced single strand fragments. Based on these findings and other data, we conclude that the human and D. melanogaster recombinases recognize and pair homologous sequences without significant melting of duplex DNA prior to strand exchange.",1989,"P Hsieh, R D Camerini-Otero, P Hsieh, R D Camerini-Otero"

Conserved sequences from the fly genes have been used to clone homologous genes in vertebrates, including mice. Studies of the pattern of expression of these genes during murine development in conjunction with the use of new functional assays suggest that not only DNA sequences, but also functional roles during embryogenesis, have been conserved.

A reduction of the mutation rate induced by EMS in adults could be observed independently of the developmental stages (larvae or imago) pretreated with 1,4-DHP. The protective effect of this new antimutagen against the alkylating agent depended on both the 1,4-DHP dose and the level of the EMS-induced mutation rate. The effect of 1,4-DHP was more pronounced than that of the studied radioprotectors. It is concluded that dihydropyridine-type compounds are able to protect eukaryote germs cells from genetic damage produced by direct-acting mutagens such as EMS.",1989,"R I Goncharova, T D Kuzhir, R I Goncharova, T D Kuzhir"
Molecular population genetics of structural variants of esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster,2517263,10.1139/g89-139,"Several lines of evidence indicate that natural selection operates between the major EST6-F and EST6-S allozymes of Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, consistent latitudinal clines and seasonal variation in their relative frequencies strongly suggest that they are not selectively equivalent in field populations. Several laboratory studies have found frequency-dependent fitness differences among the Est6-F and Est6-S genotypes. Moreover, the purified EST6-F and EST6-S allozymes differ in biochemical properties and the physiology of the enzyme, as a major component of the seminal fluid, suggests that these differences could affect reproductive aspects of fitness. However, molecular analyses reveal high levels of variation in the EST6 protein both within and between the EST6-F and EST6-S allozymes. Limited thermostability and more sensitive electrophoretic analyses reveal at least 17 variants of the two allozymes and sequence comparisons among 13 isolates of the Est6 gene reveal 16 nucleotide polymorphisms that would lead to amino acid differences. Two closely linked amino acid differences are strongly associated with the major difference between EST6-F and EST6-S; either or both of these are likely to cause the observed biochemical differences between EST6-F and EST6-S and may be the primary targets for the selection between these allozymes. The functional and adaptive significance of the other amino acid polymorphisms is unclear, although the data suggest that the EST6-8 haplotype within EST6-S has both arisen and proliferated relatively recently.",1989,"J G Oakeshott, P H Cooke, R C Richmond, A Bortoli, A Y Game, J Labate, J G Oakeshott, P H Cooke, R C Richmond, A Bortoli, A Y Game, J Labate"
A TEST OF THE ROLE OF EPISTASIS IN DIVERGENCE UNDER UNIFORM SELECTION,28564195,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1989.tb05175.x,"Five populations of Drosophila melanogaster have previously been shown to be replicably different in their responses to artificial selection for knockdown resistance to ethanol fumes (Cohan and Hoffmann, 1986). The present study tests whether this divergence could be attributed to the epistatic mechanism assumed by Wright's shifting-balance model of evolution, in which alleles favored in the genetic background of one population are not favored in that of another. If this were the mechanism of divergence, crosses between selected lines from different populations would be expected to yield an epistatic loss of the selected phenotype. However, all such crosses showed a good fit to an additive model with dominance. Divergence by an epistatic mechanism may also be associated with epistatic variance within populations, but no evidence for such epistasis was found. The populations therefore appear to have responded in different ways to selection not because of epistasis but because knockdown-resistance alleles that were common in some populations were absent (or at least less common) in others.",1989,"Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley, Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley"

The Drosophila proteasome undergoes changes in its subunit pattern during development,2491814,10.1016/0014-4827(89)90228-0,"The two-dimensional electrophoretic protein subunit pattern of the proteasome, which is a mulifunctional non-lysosomal proteinase, was analyzed throughout the development of Drosophila melanogaster. The experiments show that the proteasome is already present in early embryos and its characteristic gross morphology as judged by the outer diameter of 12 nm and the inner depression of 3 nm remains unaltered. The electrophoretic analysis of the enzyme subunits demonstrates that the proteasome undergoes, dependent on development, alterations in its protein composition. The most simple subunit pattern is observed in Schneider's S-3 tissue culture cells and early embryos while with ongoing fly development the subunit pattern of the proteasome becomes increasingly complex. 32P-Labeling and immunoblotting experiments indicate that post-translational modification of the subunits must in part be responsible for the development-dependent diversification of the subunit pattern. Our data raise the possibility that the in vivo proteolytic activity and the in vivo substrate specificity of the proteasome may be regulated by modification of its subunit composition during fly development.",1989,"C Haass, P M Kloetzel, C Haass, P M Kloetzel"
The promoters and spacers in the rDNAs of the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila,2502472,10.1016/0378-1119(89)90075-9,"The spacer sequences of rDNAs of members of the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila (melanogaster, simulans, mauritiana, teissieri, and yakuba) have been compared. The external transcribed spacers (ETSs; the region encoding the 5' end of the primary transcript, upstream from the 18S sequences) are highly conserved between in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana, whereas the more distantly related D. yakuba and D. teissieri differ in having apparent deletions of 22 and 27 bp, respectively, in this region. The divergence of nucleotide sequence upstream from the transcription start points is consistent with the established phylogeny of the five species. The sequences between bp positions -47 and +24 from the primary transcription start point show extremely little variation between each species. This is also the case for sequences between the approximate bp positions -140 to -125 and -85 to -70. This could indicate a functional importance not only of the sequences next to the transcription start point, but also of these upstream regions. An array of 240-bp repeats can be found at a comparable distance upstream from the transcription start point in each species. Matrix homology comparisons indicate that for each species not only is the sequence at the primary transcription start point duplicated within the 240-bp repeats as previously reported for D. melanogaster, but that this is part of a longer interrupted duplication which includes a region of strong similarity with the sequence between the approximate positions -105 to -65. This region is contained within one of the regions upstream from the transcription start point that is strongly conserved between the species. This sequence may therefore have functional significance not only for the transcription of the rRNA precursor, but also for transcription of the so-called NTS sequences which is now known to occur. The 240-bp arrays are themselves highly conserved within a species indicating that homogenisation mechanisms are operative. The divergence of these arrays between species is consistent with the phylogenetic tree. The 3' sequences of the primary transcription unit, now known to be RNA-processing sites, are also highly similar between the species. Immediately downstream from these sites there is little homology between the rDNA of the different species, until 95-bp tandem arrays are reached in each case.",1989,"D C Hayward, D M Glover, D C Hayward, D M Glover"

"A genetic and developmental analysis of mutations in labial, a gene necessary for proper head formation in Drosophila melanogaster",2570723,10.1016/0012-1606(89)90187-5,"We have undertaken a developmental genetic analysis of labial (lab), the most proximal gene in the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) of Drosophila melanogaster. The terminal phenotype of mutant embryos was examined in cuticle preparations, in thin sections, and by scanning electron microscopy. These preparations revealed a failure of head involution and the loss or disruption of several head structures, including the salivary glands and the H-piece and ventral arm of the cephalopharyngeal apparatus. Although these structures are presumed to derive from the gnathocephalic segments, we argue that the observed defects are likely to be a secondary consequence of a failure of head involution. A function for lab in the development of the adult head was inferred from the phenotype of animals bearing hypomorphic alleles and from clones of lab- tissue generated by mitotic recombination. Two aspects of the mutant phenotype were manifested. Ventrally, a deletion and/or disruption of tissue occurred in the maxillary palp and vibrissae regions. Dorsally, the posterior head appeared to be transformed to a thoracic-like identity. Mutations in lab, like those in the Deformed and proboscipedia loci of the ANT-C, reveal a homoeotic phenotype only in the adult stage of the life cycle.",1989,"V K Merrill, R J Diederich, F R Turner, T C Kaufman, V K Merrill, R J Diederich, F R Turner, T C Kaufman"
Effect of rate of inbreeding on inbreeding depression in Drosophila melanogaster,24232484,10.1007/BF00292326,"This experiment was designed to study the relationship between rate of inbreeding and observed inbreeding depression of larval viability, adult fecundity and cold shock mortality in Drosophila melanogaster. Rates of inbreeding used were full-sib mating and closed lines of N=4 and N=20. Eight generations of mating in the N=20 lines, three generations in the N=4 lines and one generation of full-sib mating were synchronised to simultaneously produce individuals with an expected level of inbreeding coefficient (F) of approximately 0.25. Inbreeding depression for the three traits was significant at F=0.25. N=20 lines showed significantly less inbreeding depression than full-sib mated lines for larval viability at approximately the same level of F. A similar trend was observed for fecundity. No effect of rate of inbreeding depression was found for cold shock mortality, but this trait was measured with less precision than the other two. Natural selection acting on loci influencing larval viability and fecundity during the process of inbreeding could explain these results. Selection is expected to be more effective with slow rates of inbreeding because there are more generations and greater opportunity for selection to act before F=0.25 is reached. Selection intensities seem to have been different in the three traits measured. Selection was most intense for larval viability, less intense for fecundity and, perhaps, negligible at loci influencing cold shock mortality.",1989,"N G Ehiobu, M E Goddard, J F Taylor, N G Ehiobu, M E Goddard, J F Taylor"
Analysis of the dosage compensation of a specific transcript in Drosophila melanogaster,3082711,,The amount of steady-state level RNA complementary to the X-linked salivary gland secretion polypeptide gene Sgs-4 was measured in male and female third-instar larvae carrying one or two doses of a wild-type allele of the gene. RNA levels were found to be compensated in normal one-dose males and two-dose females and to be dosage-dependent within each sex. The presence of mutant alleles of male-less (mle) was found to reduce the level of Sgs-4 transcripts in males. These results support the contentions that dosage compensation is mediated by regulating the level of X-linked gene transcripts and that a product of the mle+ gene is involved in this process.,1986,"T R Breen, J C Lucchesi, T R Breen, J C Lucchesi"
Molecular organization and expression of the genetic locus glued in Drosophila melanogaster,3022132,10.1128/mcb.6.3.833,"The Glued locus of Drosophila melanogaster is genetically defined as the functional unit which is affected by the dominant Glued mutation Gl. Genomic DNA was cloned from the region of the Glued locus, at 70C2 on chromosome 3, by using a P element insertion in the region as a molecular marker. Three genes encoding polyadenylated transcripts were detected within a 30-kilobase span of the cloned DNA. The gene nearest the P element insertion site was identified as a Glued gene on the basis of alterations in its DNA and encoded transcript associated with the Gl mutation and with reversions of Gl which eliminate the dominant effect by inactivation of the mutant allele. Expression of the wild-type Gl+ gene is temporally regulated during development; the amount of the encoded transcript is highest in the embryonic stage, decreasing in the first and second larval instars, and then increasing in the third instar and pupal stages. There is a maternal contribution of the Gl+ transcript to the embryo, which probably accounts for the maternal lethal effect of Glued mutations on early development. In situ hybridizations of Gl+ DNA to RNA in tissue sections showed that the Gl+ transcript is present in virtually all tissues of the embryo, late larva, and pupa. The general distribution of this transcript is consistent with genetic evidence indicating that the Glued locus controls a generally essential cell function (P. J. Harte and D. R. Kankel, Genetics 101:477-501, 1982). Different Glued mutations produce distinct phenotypic effects, including adults with severe visual defects, larvae lacking imaginal discs, and early lethality. These diverse mutant phenotypes are discussed in terms of quantitative changes in the Glued function. Closely adjacent to Gl+ is another gene which is transcribed in a divergent direction and expressed coordinately with Gl+ throughout Drosophila development. It remains to be determined whether this gene is also involved with the Glued function.",1986,"A Swaroop, J W Sun, M L Paco-Larson, A Garen, A Swaroop, J W Sun, M L Paco-Larson, A Garen"

The results indicate that the rate of duplication of the maroon-like locus is on the order of 2.7 X 10(-6); that the rate of duplication of the rosy locus is approximately 1.7 X 10(-4); and that duplication occurs in males, suggesting that there may actually be two modes of gene duplication in Drosophila melanogaster.",1986,"S K Shapira, V G Finnerty, S K Shapira, V G Finnerty"
Homologous patterns in the embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria and the fly Drosophila melanogaster,1769332,,"To determine the generality of developmental mechanisms involved in the construction of the insect nervous system, the embryonic development of the peripheral nervous system in the grasshopper Schistocerca gregaria was characterized at the level of identified neurons and nerve branches and then compared to that previously described from the fly Drosophila melanogaster. For this, immunocytochemistry using a neuron-specific antibody was carried out on staged grasshopper embryos. Our results show that initially a simple peripheral nerve scaffolding is established in each segment of the animal. This scaffolding consists of a pair of intersegmental nerves that are formed by identified afferent and efferent pioneer neurons and a pair of segmental nerves that are formed by afferent pioneers situated in limb buds. Subsequently, identified sets of sensory neurons differentiate in a stereotyped spatiotemporal pattern in dorsal, lateral and ventral clusters in each segment and project their axons onto these nerves. Although segment-specific differences exist, serial homologs of the developing nerves and sensory neurons can be identified. A comparison of these results with those obtained from Drosophila shows that virtually the same pattern of peripheral nerves and sensory structures is formed in both species. This indicates that the construction of the peripheral nervous system in extremely divergent modern insects relies on conserved developmental mechanisms that evolved in ancestral insects over 300 million years ago.",1991,"T Meier, F Chabaud, H Reichert, T Meier, F Chabaud, H Reichert"

Using various mutation selection systems as well as lines of different origin and two kinds of ionizing radiation--gamma-rays and neutrons--the mutagenesis in the region of interest is characterized at the cytogenetic level. 85 gamma-induced mutations affecting viability were isolated in the 44F 2-4; 45C6-7 interval, 27% of mutations being chromosomal aberrations. 15 radiation-induced aberrations were obtained by selecting mutations at the white gene inserted into the 45D region by P-mediated transformation. The 44F-45D region is characterized by relatively low frequency of deficiency formation and by significant predomination of heterochromatic aberrations in the spectrum of rearrangements. In these regions, the existence of hot spots for heterochromatic aberrations was discovered. As low deletion frequency is not connected with the presence of haplolethal and haplosterile loci in the region studied, the unusual character of radiation mutagenesis reflects possibly the peculiarities in sequence organization of the chromosomal region mentioned or the packaging in the sperm nuclei.",1991,"A Iu Konev, E R Varentsova, S V Sarantseva, Iu M Khromykh, A Iu Konev, E R Varentsova, S V Sarantseva, Iu M Khromykh"

We analysed the molecular organization of the gene by cDNA clone isolation and sequencing as well as S1 mapping and primer extension analyses. The results obtained reveal that the gene is colinear with its genomic sequence and define the usage of both 5' and 3' alternative sites for Pig-1 transcription; two continuous open reading frames (ORFs) are fully contained within the Pig-1 transcribed region, although several lines of evidence suggest that only the longer ORF is likely to be translated.

To investigate the replicative potential of such sequences in Drosophila, five of these ARS elements and also the Adh gene of D. melanogaster, which has been described earlier to have ARS function in yeast, were microinjected into developing Drosophila eggs and analysed after reisolation from first instar larvae. As an assay for DNA replication, we determined the sensitivity of recovered plasmid DNA to restriction enzymes that discriminate between adenine methylation and non-methylation. Within the limits of detection our results show that none of the plasmids replicated two or more rounds. However, a fraction of all injected plasmid DNAs, including vector DNA, seems to replicate once. The same result was obtained for a DNA sequence from mouse that had been reported to have replication origin function in mouse tissue culture cells. We excluded the possibility that methylation of the plasmids is the reason for their inability to replicate. These results demonstrate that homologous and heterologous DNA sequences that drive replication of plasmids in cells of other species are not sufficient to fulfil this function in Drosophila embryos.",1991,"G E Roth, G E Roth"
Evidence for balanced linkage of X chromosome polygenes in a natural population of Drosophila,1901815,,"Extensive levels of polygenic variation can be maintained in a population without creating a severe segregational load.

To test whether this occurs in a natural population, we isolated ten Drosophila melanogaster X chromosomes and mapped regions of polygenic activity affecting sternopleural bristle number. The chromosomes fell into a small number of groups based upon the similarity of their distributions of polygenic activity. The results are consistent with a model in which a large proportion of the variation can be attributed to a small number of segregating chromosome regions and in which the chromosomes show internal balance.",1991,"J N Thompson Jr, J J Hellack, R R Tucker, J N Thompson Jr, J J Hellack, R R Tucker"

In 62 of these lines early stages of oogenesis are affected, and these females usually do not lay any eggs. In 333 lines oogenesis proceeds apparently normally to stage 8 of oogenesis, but morphological defects become often apparent during later stages of oogenesis, and are visible in the defective eggs produced by these females whereas 133 lay eggs that appear morphologically normal, but do not support normal embryonic development. Of the lines 341 have been genetically characterized and define a total of 140 loci on the second chromosome. Not all the loci are specific for oogenesis.

Subfreezing volumetric behavior and stochastic modeling of intracellular ice formation in Drosophila melanogaster embryos,1901783,10.1016/0011-2240(91)90009-d,"Cryomicroscopic observations were made of the volumetric behavior and kinetics of intracellular ice formation (IIF) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos in a modified cell culture medium (BD.20) or BD.20 + 2 M ethylene glycol. After rapid cooling to a given temperature, transient volumetric contraction of the embryos during the isothermal period was quantified by computerized video image analysis. Fitting these data to the numerical solution of the volume flux equation yielded estimates of the hydraulic permeability coefficient (Lp) for individual embryos at various subfreezing temperatures. Lp approximately followed an Arrhenius relation between -2 and -9 degrees C, with a value of 0.168 microns/(min-atm) extrapolated to 0 degrees C and an apparent activation energy delta E of 38.9 kcal/mol. IIF during an isothermal period occurred at random times whose characteristic temperature range and kinetics were affected by the presence of ethylene glycol. A stochastic process model developed to fit these data indicated the influence of both time-dependent and instantaneous components of IIF, presumed to be the result of seeding and heterogeneous nucleation, respectively. The presence of 2 M ethylene glycol depressed the characteristic temperature of instantaneous IIF by about 12 degrees C and reduced the rate constant for time-dependent IIF.

The homeotic gene Sex combs reduced of Drosophila melanogaster is differentially regulated in the embryonic and imaginal stages of development,1683847,,"The Sex combs reduced (Scr) locus is unique among the genes contained within the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) of Drosophila melanogaster in that it directs functions that are required for both cephalic and thoracic development in the embryo and the adult. Antibodies raised against protein encoded by Scr were used to follow the distribution of this gene product in embryos and imaginal discs of third instar larvae. Analysis of Scr protein accumulation in embryos hemizygous for breakpoint lesions mapping throughout the locus has allowed us to determine that sequences required for establishment of the Scr embryonic pattern are contained within a region of DNA that overlaps with the identified upstream regulatory region of the segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz). Gain-of-function mutations in Scr result in the presence of ectopic sex comb teeth on the first tarsal segment of mesothoracic and metathoracic legs of adult males. Heterozygous combinations of gain-of-function alleles with a wild-type Scr gene exhibit no evidence of ectopic protein localization in the second and third thoracic segments of embryos. However, mesothoracic and metathoracic leg imaginal discs can be shown to accumulate ectopically expressed Scr protein, implying a differential regulation of the Scr gene during these two periods of development. Additionally, we have found that the spatial pattern of Scr gene expression in imaginal tissues involved in the development of the adult thorax is governed in part by synapsis of homologous chromosomes in this region of the ANT-C. However, those imaginal discs that arise anteriorly to the prothorax do not appear to be sensitive to this form of gene regulation. Finally, we have demonstrated that the extent of Scr expression is influenced by mutations at the Polycomb (Pc) locus but not by mutant alleles of the zeste (z) gene. Taken together, our data suggests that Scr gene expression is differentially regulated both temporally and spatially in a manner that is sensitive to the structure of the locus.",1991,"A M Pattatucci, T C Kaufman, A M Pattatucci, T C Kaufman"

In this study, we examined the effects of mutations of ap on female receptivity and its relationship to juvenile hormone. We observed abnormally low female receptivity in homozygous ap strains, and heteroallelic combinations of ap mutations exhibited low receptivity. For female receptivity, ap showed no dominance (i.e., ap/ap+ was intermediate between ap/ap and ap+/ap+). Low receptivity mapped genetically to the ap locus.

Dosage dependence of maternal contribution to somatic cell division in Drosophila melanogaster,1811949,,"Most mitotic mutants in Drosophila do not lead to lethality in early development despite the highly abnormal chromosome behaviour that they elicit. This has been explained as being the effect of maternally provided wild-type products. We have tested this hypothesis by studying cuticular clones derived from cells in which there has been loss of a marked Y chromosome due to chromosome nondisjunction in individuals homozygous for the mutation abnormal spindle who are progeny of heterozygous mothers. We have found that the size and frequency of these clones are higher than in control flies. Furthermore, by analysing flies whose female parents have different doses of the asp+ gene, we have found that there is a correlation between the amount of maternally contributed asp+ product and the frequency and size of cuticular clones. We have also estimated the time in development when the first mitotic mistakes take place, i.e. the time when maternal products are no longer sufficient to carry out normal cell division.",1991,"M Carmena, C Gonzalez, J Casal, P Ripoll, M Carmena, C Gonzalez, J Casal, P Ripoll"
Identification of an unusual structure in the Drosophila melanogaster transposable element copia: evidence for copia transposition through an RNA intermediate,1716242,10.1016/0378-1119(91)90271-c,"The Drosophila melanogaster transposable element copia is usually 5 kb long with long terminal repeats (LTRs), and its major transcripts are a full-length 5-kb RNA and a 2-kb RNA. We have previously shown that the 2-kb RNA is generated through splicing. Here, we have cloned a genomic intronless copia using an oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe which is specific for the junction of the two exons. The unusual copia is bounded by two LTRs and lacks precisely the intron of the 2-kb copia RNA. Identification of genomic intronless copia strongly suggests that copia transposes through an RNA intermediate. Moreover, we have found that copia virus-like particles (VLPs), in which reverse transcription of copia RNA seems likely to occur, packages the spliced copia RNA much less efficiently than the full-length copia RNA. This result leads to the suggestion that much lower copy number of genomic intronless copia, as compared with that of 'normal' copia, may be responsible for the inefficient packaging of the spliced copia RNA into the VLP.",1991,"K Yoshioka, H Kanda, H Akiba, M Enoki, T Shiba, K Yoshioka, H Kanda, H Akiba, M Enoki, T Shiba"
Immunoelectron microscopic study of the opsin distribution in the photoreceptor cells of Drosophila melanogaster,1838762,,"Distribution of opsin in the compound eye of Drosophila melanogaster was examined by post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal antibody against the Drosophila Rh1 opsin and gold-conjugated secondary antibody. Numerous gold particles were observed on the rhabdomeric microvilli of R1-R6 retinular cells. In the retinular cell body, gold particles were distributed in rough endoplasmic reticulum, subrhabdomeric cisternae (SRC), multivesicular bodies, and secondary lysosomes. In the rdgA mutant, whose SRC are absent, density of gold particles on the rhabdomeric microvilli was about 20% of normal. These results suggest the involvement of SRC in opsin transport.",1991,"E Suzuki, K Hirosawa, E Suzuki, K Hirosawa"

[A genetic study of the interaction of Piry virus with drosophila],1796217,10.1016/0923-2516(91)90018-x,"Piry virus mutants selected for altered growth properties in Drosophila melanogaster have previously been designated agD mutants. This paper presents a classification scheme for grouping some of these mutants and also presents the characteristics of some members of each group. Analysis, for each agD clone, of the mean incubation time at 20 degrees C relative to the mean incubation time at 28 degrees C (t20,t28), compared to the range of similar data for wild-type virus enabled us to define 4 classes of agD mutant: (1) mutants equally affected at both temperatures, (2) cold-sensitive mutants in drosophila (csD), (3) heat-sensitive mutants in drosophila (tsD) and (4) mutants whose mean incubation time could not be estimated at either 20 or 28 degrees C. All agD mutants are listed. The majority of them were also ts in chicken embryo cells (CEC), and some were classified into complementation groups. Some correlations were noted. For example, the agD mutants that were ts+ in CEC were frequently (7 out of 12) weakly cold-sensitive in drosophila. Those tsD mutants which were also ts in CEC, all belonged to complementation group I (L protein). True csD mutants, whose divergence of incubation time with wt regularly increased, and which were also ts in CEC, all belonged to group I except for one which belonged to group V (G protein). Three mutants fell into a distinct sub-class of csD mutants, characterized by a defect in the CO2 sensitivity symptom expression below a definite temperature. One of these which was further characterized was shown to be in complementation group V. Some mutants of the fourth class were examined for their fly-invading capacity. This was found to be more-or-less strongly affected. Among these mutants, independent of this phenomenon, mutations were assigned to L, N and G proteins, suggesting that different physiological defects are involved. A comparison was made of the phenotypes in drosophila of some of the agD mutants with other members of the vesiculovirus family. The analogy of sigma rhabdovirus with tsD mutants is also reported.",1991,"G Brun, G Brun"
The rosy locus in Drosophila melanogaster: xanthine dehydrogenase and eye pigments,1783294,,"The rosy gene in Drosophila melanogaster codes for the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Mutants that have no enzyme activity are characterized by a brownish eye color phenotype reflecting a deficiency in the red eye pigment. Xanthine dehydrogenase is not synthesized in the eye, but rather is transported there. The present report describes the ultrastructural localization of XDH in the Drosophila eye. Three lines of evidence are presented demonstrating that XDH is sequestered within specific vacuoles, the type II pigment granules. Histochemical and antibody staining of frozen sections, as well as thin layer chromatography studies of several adult genotypes serve to examine some of the factors and genic interactions that may be involved in transport of XDH, and in eye pigment formation. While a specific function for XDH in the synthesis of the red, pteridine eye pigments remains unknown, these studies present evidence that: (1) the incorporation of XDH into the pigment granules requires specific interaction between a normal XDH molecule and one or more transport proteins; (2) the structural integrity of the pigment granule itself is dependent upon the presence of a normal balance of eye pigments, a notion advanced earlier.",1991,"A G Reaume, D A Knecht, A Chovnick, A G Reaume, D A Knecht, A Chovnick"
"apterous, a gene required for imaginal disc development in Drosophila encodes a member of the LIM family of developmental regulatory proteins",1349545,10.1101/gad.6.5.715,"The apterous (ap) gene is required for the normal development of the wing and haltere imaginal discs in Drosophila melanogaster. ap encodes a new member of the LIM family of developmental regulatory genes. The deduced amino acid sequence of ap predicts a homeo domain and a cysteine/histidine-rich domain known as the LIM domain. In these domains ap is highly similar to the mec-3 and lin-11 proteins of Caenorhabditis elegans and to the vertebrate insulin enhancer-binding protein isl-1. ap is presumably required for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in wing and haltere development. The nature of the defects in homozygous null mutant flies is consistent with the pattern of ap expression in the larval imaginal discs. ap is also expressed in a complex pattern in the embryo, including portions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS).

Circadian oscillations in period gene mRNA levels are transcriptionally regulated,1465387,10.1073/pnas.89.24.11711,"The period (per) gene is involved in regulating circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster. The per gene is expressed in a circadian manner, where fluctuations in per mRNA abundance are influenced by its own translation product, which also cycles in abundance. Since per gene expression is necessary for circadian rhythmicity, we sought to determine how certain features of this feedback loop operate. The results of this study reveal that fluctuations in per mRNA are primarily controlled by fluctuations in per gene transcription, that per mRNA has a relatively short half-life, and that sequences sufficient to drive per mRNA cycling are present in 1.3 kilobases of 5' flanking sequences. These and other results indicate that the per feedback loop has all of the basic properties necessary to be a component of a circadian oscillator.",1992,"P E Hardin, J C Hall, M Rosbash, P E Hardin, J C Hall, M Rosbash"
[MDG1het and aurora--non-mobile retrotransposons of Drosophila melanogaster],1332909,,"Non-mobile retrotransposons mdg1het and aurora localized in Drosophila melanogaster heterochromatin were studied.

Mobile aurora copies were revealed in D. simulans euchromatin by in situ hybridization technique. A comparison of 2.5 kb sequence of immobile mdg1het (including a half of ORF2 and 3'-LTR) with the correspondent sequence of transposable mdg1 copy [9] allowed to conclude that evolution of mdg1 subfamilies occurred under the selective pressure for the ability to transpose.

The genomic mutation rate for fitness in Drosophila,1522887,10.1038/359058a0,"The mutation rate per genome for local affecting fitness is crucial in theories of the evolution of sex and recombination and of outbreeding mechanisms. Mutational variation in fitness may also be important in the evolution of mate choice in animals. No information is available on the rate at which spontaneous mutations with small effects on fitness arise, although viability (probability of survival to adulthood) has been studied in Drosophila melanogaster. These experiments involved the accumulation of spontaneous mutations in the virtual absence of natural selection, in a set of independently maintained lines with a common origin. The rates of decline in mean and increase in variance among lines permit estimation of limits to the mean number of new mutations arising per generation (U) and the average homozygous effect of a new mutation of minor effect(s). For the second chromosome of D. melanogaster, the value of U is at least 0.17 (ref. 7), and (1-h)s is less than 0.02, where hs is the average decline in fitness of heterozygotes. As the second chromosome is about 40% of the genome, these data indicate a mutation rate per haploid genome of at least 0.42 for viability. Here we present similar data on the effects of homozygous spontaneous mutations on a measure of fitness in D. melanogaster.",1992,"D Houle, D K Hoffmaster, S Assimacopoulos, B Charlesworth, D Houle, D K Hoffmaster, S Assimacopoulos, B Charlesworth"
The Drosophila G protein gamma subunit gene (D-G gamma 1) produces three developmentally regulated transcripts and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system,1372898,,"A genomic clone, 536, located at the 44CD region of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, has been characterized for its neurobiological importance. We found that this clone contains a gene which produces 2.6-, 1.3- and 1.1-kilobase (kb) RNAs. While the 2.6-kb RNA is expressed only in the head, the 1.3-kb RNA is present exclusively in the body. The 1.1-kb RNA, however, is found in both the head and body, but in much higher concentration in the head. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.6-kb RNA-specific cDNA showed that this gene encodes a 70-amino acid polypeptide which is the putative Drosophila homologue to the gamma subunit of the bovine G-protein. The Drosophila protein, named D-G gamma 1, shares 46, 43, and 28% identity, and 59, 52, and 60% similarity, with the gamma 2, gamma 3, and gamma t proteins of bovine G proteins, respectively. Sequencing of the 1.1-kb RNA-specific cDNA clone revealed that the 1.1-kb RNA is produced from the 2.6-kb transcription unit by usage of an alternative polyadenylation site, and has a coding region identical to that of the 2.6-kb RNA. Genomic Southern blot hybridization indicated that the Drosophila genome has only one D-G gamma 1 gene. Throughout development the 1.1-kb RNA is found to be the most prevalent species; its level peaks between 9 and 12 h of embryogenesis. As is the case for the other G protein genes of Drosophila, the D-G gamma 1 gene is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system of the fly.",1992,"K Ray, R Ganguly, K Ray, R Ganguly"

Previous studies have revealed considerable variation in the DNA sequences of comparable regions in the related Drosophila species, D. simulans, D. erecta and D. yakuba. We detected GEBF-I-like proteins in these species, which appear to evolve as rapidly as the corresponding DNA sequences, and studied in detail the binding characteristics of the GEBF-I proteins of the two most closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. simulans. In crosses between these species, certain strains produce hybrid larvae which, unexpectedly, synthesised a single intermediate form of the protein. This suggests that the factor is subject to species-specific post-transcriptional modifications. In these hybrid larvae, which carry one D. melanogaster and one D. simulans Sgs-3 gene, the hybrid GEBF-I protein appears equally effective in the induction of both target genes.",1992,"P Georgel, F Bellard, G Dretzen, K Jagla, G Richards, M Bellard, P Georgel, F Bellard, G Dretzen, K Jagla, G Richards, M Bellard"

Selection for canalization at two extra dorsocentral bristles in Drosophila melanogaster,1552158,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a111156,"From 10 isofemale lines of D. melanogaster, the D2 line was established with the aim of obtaining an invariant phenotype at two extra dorsocentral bristles. Line D2 was also subdivided into two other lines, SA and ASD, based on their different bristle patterns. The SA line was selected for two symmetrical anterior extra bristles, and the ASD line was selected for two asymmetrical extra bristles, one anterior and one posterior. Only the SA line showed any canalizing response (estimated by the width of the probit transformation) at the two-extra-bristle class. Nevertheless, the results from the different lines were more consistent with the independent ones of both the anterior and posterior regions of the extra dorsocentral bristles. This analysis showed some independent genetic systems for each region, developmental canalization being at two extra symmetrical bristles per region in all the selected lines (D2, ASD, and SA). Therefore, this canalization did not depend directly on the extra-bristle positional pattern used in the selection. The wild-type canalizing system is suggested to explain the fast canalizing response in a phenotype that had not been previously canalized by natural selection.",1992,"R PiÃ±eiro, R PiÃ±eiro"

Molecular analysis has shown that fs(2)PM11-19 contains a 5 kb insert within 500 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site of the gsI gene. Mutant flies have extremely low levels of gsI transcription and GSI activity. A pre-existing deficiency (Df(2L) netPM1) with a breakpoint near the transcription start site was also found to be a female-sterile allele of gsI. All eggs laid by PM11-19 homozygous females, as well as by females heterozygous for this mutation and a deletion or any of several recessive lethal alleles of the gsI gene, fail to hatch.

The results demonstrate that disco flies are rhythmic, indicating that they have an active circadian pacemaker that can be entrained by light.

"Dipeptidase-C in Drosophila melanogaster: genetic, ontogenetic, and tissue-specific variation",1296574,10.1007/BF02399810,"Dip-A, Dip-B, and Dip-C constitute structural genes for three peptidic enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster distinct from the leucine aminopeptidases. Their ontogenetic and tissue distributions of activities suggest the involvement of these enzymes in a general metabolic role, such as the regulation of amino acid and oligopeptide pools to make amino acids available for protein synthesis. Screening of chromosome substitution isogenic lines for DIP-C activity indicated that, like DIP-A and DIP-B, unlinked activity modifiers exist for Dip-C. The developmental profiles of dipeptidase activities are very similar, except in the pupal stage, during which DIP-C activity is markedly low compared to the other two enzymes. Intercorrelations of dipeptidase activities vary ontogenetically, which is consistent with the need for coordinate expression of these enzymes during certain developmental stages. Tissue-specific expression of dipeptidases in larvae and adults are also similar, although the relative levels of DIP-A activity differ from those of DIP-B and DIP-C in certain organs and body parts. Some of the differences among chromosome substitution lines for dipeptidase activities appear to be systemic, while others are developmental stage-specific and tissue-specific. Second- and third-chromosome variants for DIP-C activity differed in their tissue distribution.

Partner choice in heterologous chromosome segregation of the Y chromosome in competitive situations in the oocyte of Drosophila melanogaster,1624136,10.1007/BF00120320,"Heterologous segregation of the Y chromosome and secondary non-disjunction of the X chromosomes in female meiosis of Drosophila melanogaster was investigated in ten different crosses where different constellations of translocation/inversion or translocation/translocation systems of the large autosomes were present in the female parent. It appeared that the Y chromosome always segregates from the shortest of the possible heterologous pairing partners. This may be due to size-dependent mechanism of so-called 'distributive disjunction' or to the possibility that the shorter the chromosome element is, the more easily it moves in the nucleus of the oocyte. Secondary non-disjunction of the X chromosomes appeared to be lower the more possible autosomal pairing partners the Y chromosome had, suggesting that the autosomes effectively compete with the X chromosomes for pairing with the Y chromosome. An alternative explanation is that, due to interchromosomal effect on recombination, crossing over in the X chromosomes was different in different experiments.",1992,"P Portin, P Portin"
"Sequence, biochemical characterization, and developmental expression of a new member of the TGF-beta superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster",1601181,10.1016/0012-1606(92)90188-m,"More than 20 members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors have been implicated in development. One member of the TGF-beta family has been previously reported from Drosophila, the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene which is involved in embryonic dorsal/ventral polarity, embryonic gut formation, and imaginal disk development. Using PCR methods, we have identified a second Drosophila gene in the TGF-beta family. It encodes a protein product that is more similar to the TGF-beta-related human bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 5, 6, and 7 than it is to the Drosophila dpp gene product. Because of its localization on the polytene chromosome map, we refer to this gene as 60A. Expression of a 60A cDNA in Drosophila S2 cells was used to determine that 60A encodes a preproprotein that is processed to yield secreted amino- and carboxy-terminal polypeptides. The carboxy-terminal peptides are recovered as disulfide-linked homodimers. The 60A transcripts and protein are first detected at the onset of gastrulation, primarily in the mesoderm of the extending germ band.

The polygenic mutation rate (VM ) for two quantitative traits, abdominal and sternopleural bristle number, was estimated from divergence among sublines at 10 generation intervals from generations 30-100, and from response of each line to divergent selection after more than 65 generations of mutation accumulation. Estimates of VM averaged over males and females both from divergence among lines and from response to selection within lines were 3.3 ? 10-3 VE for abdominal bristles and 1.5 ? 10-3 VE for sternopleural bristles, where VE is the environmental variance. The actual rate of production of mutations affecting these traits may be considerably higher if the traits are under stabilizing selection, and if mutations affecting bristle number have deleterious effects on fitness. There was a substantial component of variance for sex ? mutant effect interaction and the sublines evolved highly significant mutational variation in sex dimorphism of abdominal bristle number. Pleiotropic effects on sex dimorphism may be a general property of mutations at loci determining bristle number.",1992,"Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill, Trudy F C Mackay, Richard F Lyman, Michael S Jackson, Christophe Terzian, William G Hill"

The pogo transposable element family of Drosophila melanogaster,1313144,10.1007/BF00299145,"A 190 bp insertion is associated with the white-eosin mutation in Drosophila melanogaster. This insertion is a member of a family of transposable elements, pogo elements, which is of the same class as the P and hobo elements of D. melanogaster. Strains typically have many copies of a 190 bp element, 10-15 elements 1.1-1.5 kb in size and several copies of a 2.1 kb element. The smaller elements all appear to be derived from the largest by single internal deletions so that all elements share terminal sequences. They either always insert at the dinucleotide TA and have perfect 21 bp terminal inverse repeats, or have 22 bp inverse repeats and produce no duplication upon insertion. Analysis by DNA blotting of their distribution and occupancy of insertion sites in different strains suggests that they may be less mobile than P or hobo. The DNA sequence of the largest element has two long open reading frames on one strand which are joined by splicing as indicated by cDNA analysis. RNAs of this strand are made, whose sizes are similar to the major size classes of elements. A protein predicted by the DNA sequence has significant homology with a human centrosomal-associated protein, CENP-B.

Our results suggest that east+ expression in the nervous system is required for a normal adult chemosensory response and both increases and decreases in levels of the gene product result in a mutant phenotype.",1992,"K VijayRaghavan, J Kaur, J Paranjape, V Rodrigues, K VijayRaghavan, J Kaur, J Paranjape, V Rodrigues"
Spatial and temporal expression of an Antennapedia/lac Z gene construct integrated into the endogenous Antennapedia gene of Drosophila melanogaster,28305895,10.1007/BF00420417,"In order to study the regulation of spatial and temporal expression of the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) in Drosophila melanogaster, we have constructed fusion genes which contain Antp sequences linked to the reporter gene lac Z of Escherichia coli. In one case of P-element transformation, a fusion gene construct integrated into the endogenous Antp gene close to one of the two promoters (P1). The spatial expression from the reporter gene in this transformant line, as analysed by the detection of Î²-galactosidase activity, was found to exactly mimic the normal expression from the P1 promoter of the Antp gene. We have used this unique transformant as a tool for studying the expression of the P1 promoter in embryonic, larval and adult development. Parallel lines transformed with the same fusion gene construct did not confer a correct P1 pattern of expression. The position in the genome was, therefore, crucial for the expression pattern of the reporter gene. Experiments aiming at the detection of autoregulatory control of Antp gene expression were designed. The results did not, however, support models of positive or negative autoregulation of P1 expression by Amp protein.",1992,"Ylva EngstrÃ¶m, Stephan Schneuwly, Walter Jakob Gehring, Ylva EngstrÃ¶m, Stephan Schneuwly, Walter Jakob Gehring"
Thioredoxin-2 affects lifespan and oxidative stress in Drosophila,17567437,10.1111/j.2007.0018-0661.01990.x,"Thioredoxins are proteins that have thiol-reducing activity and a characteristic conserved active site (WCGPC). They have several documented functions, e.g. roles in defences against oxidative stress and as electron donors for ribonucleotide-reductase. In Drosophila melanogaster there are three ""classical"" thioredoxins with the conserved active site: deadhead, ThioredoxinT and Thioredoxin-2. Here, we report the creation of null-mutations in the Thioredoxin-2 (Trx-2) gene. Characterization of two Trx-2 mutants indicated that Trx-2 affects the lifespan of D. melanogaster, and is involved in the organism's oxidative stress protection system. We found that the mutants have a shorter lifespan than wild-type flies, and thioredoxin double mutant flies showed lower tolerance to oxidative stress than wild-type flies, while flies carrying multiple copies of a Trx-2 rescue construct showed higher tolerance. These findings suggest that Trx-2 has modest or redundant functions in Drosophila physiology under unstressed conditions, but could be important during times of environmental stress.",2007,"Malin J Svensson, Jan Larsson, Malin J Svensson, Jan Larsson"
Post-mating disparity between potential and realized immune response in Drosophila melanogaster,17311779,10.1098/rspb.2006.0394,"Reproductive costs are an essential component of evolutionary theory. For instance, an increase in reproduction is generally coupled with a decrease in immunocompetence shortly after mating. However, recent work in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that the potential to mount an immune response, as measured by the levels of immune gene expression, increases after mating. These data are in contrast to previous studies, which suggest that mating can reduce a fly's ability to survive an actual bacterial challenge (realized immunity). This pattern may be driven by some aspect of mating, independent of resource limitation, which reduces immune function by inhibiting the effective deployment of immune gene products. Though several studies have examined both the potential and the realized immunity after mating, none have examined these immune measures simultaneously. Here, we examined the link between the potential and the realized immunity in a sterile mutant of D. melanogaster. Shortly after mating, we found that female immune gene expression was high, but survival against infection was low. Surprisingly, this pattern was reversed within 24 h. Thus, estimates of immunity based on gene expression do not appear to reflect an actual ability to defend against pathogens in the hours following copulation. We discuss the possible mechanisms that may account for this pattern.",2007,"Kenneth M Fedorka, Jodell E Linder, Wade Winterhalter, Daniel Promislow, Kenneth M Fedorka, Jodell E Linder, Wade Winterhalter, Daniel Promislow"

Meiotic recombination in Drosophila Msh6 mutants yields discontinuous gene conversion tracts,17339220,10.1534/genetics.107.070367,"Crossovers (COs) generated through meiotic recombination are important for the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. Several models describing the molecular mechanism of meiotic recombination have been proposed. These models differ in the arrangement of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) in recombination intermediates. Heterologies in hDNA are usually repaired prior to the recovery of recombination products, thereby obscuring information about the arrangement of hDNA. To examine hDNA in meiotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, we sought to block hDNA repair by conducting recombination assays in a mutant defective in mismatch repair (MMR). We generated mutations in the MMR gene Msh6 and analyzed recombination between highly polymorphic homologous chromosomes. We found that hDNA often goes unrepaired during meiotic recombination in an Msh6 mutant, leading to high levels of postmeiotic segregation; however, hDNA and gene conversion tracts are frequently discontinuous, with multiple transitions between gene conversion, restoration, and unrepaired hDNA. We suggest that these discontinuities reflect the activity of a short-patch repair system that operates when canonical MMR is defective.",2007,"Sarah J Radford, Mathilde M Sabourin, Susan McMahan, Jeff Sekelsky, Sarah J Radford, Mathilde M Sabourin, Susan McMahan, Jeff Sekelsky"
Long-term patterns of genomic P element content and P-M characteristics of Drosophila melanogaster in eastern Australia,18270438,10.1266/ggs.82.479,"A latitudinal cline in characteristics associated with the P DNA transposable element is well known in eastern Australian populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

A specific primed immune response in Drosophila is dependent on phagocytes,17352533,10.1371/journal.ppat.0030026,"Drosophila melanogaster, like other invertebrates, relies solely on its innate immune response to fight invading microbes; by definition, innate immunity lacks adaptive characteristics. However, we show here that priming Drosophila with a sublethal dose of Streptococcus pneumoniae protects against an otherwise-lethal second challenge of S. pneumoniae. This protective effect exhibits coarse specificity for S. pneumoniae and persists for the life of the fly. Although not all microbial challenges induced this specific primed response, we find that a similar specific protection can be elicited by Beauveria bassiana, a natural fly pathogen. To characterize this primed response, we focused on S. pneumoniae-induced protection. The mechanism underlying this protective effect requires phagocytes and the Toll pathway. However, activation of the Toll pathway is not sufficient for priming-induced protection. This work contradicts the paradigm that insect immune responses cannot adapt and will promote the search for similar responses overlooked in organisms with an adaptive immune response.",2007,"Linh N Pham, Marc S Dionne, Mimi Shirasu-Hiza, David S Schneider, Linh N Pham, Marc S Dionne, Mimi Shirasu-Hiza, David S Schneider"
Two chemosensory receptors together mediate carbon dioxide detection in Drosophila,17167414,10.1038/nature05466,"Blood-feeding insects, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, use highly specialized and sensitive olfactory systems to locate their hosts. This is accomplished by detecting and following plumes of volatile host emissions, which include carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is sensed by a population of olfactory sensory neurons in the maxillary palps of mosquitoes and in the antennae of the more genetically tractable fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster. The molecular identity of the chemosensory CO2 receptor, however, remains unknown. Here we report that CO2-responsive neurons in Drosophila co-express a pair of chemosensory receptors, Gr21a and Gr63a, at both larval and adult life stages. We identify mosquito homologues of Gr21a and Gr63a, GPRGR22 and GPRGR24, and show that these are co-expressed in A. gambiae maxillary palps. We show that Gr21a and Gr63a together are sufficient for olfactory CO2-chemosensation in Drosophila. Ectopic expression of Gr21a and Gr63a together confers CO2 sensitivity on CO2-insensitive olfactory neurons, but neither gustatory receptor alone has this function. Mutant flies lacking Gr63a lose both electrophysiological and behavioural responses to CO2. Knowledge of the molecular identity of the insect olfactory CO2 receptors may spur the development of novel mosquito control strategies designed to take advantage of this unique and critical olfactory pathway. This in turn could bolster the worldwide fight against malaria and other insect-borne diseases.",2007,"Walton D Jones, Pelin Cayirlioglu, Ilona Grunwald Kadow, Leslie B Vosshall, Walton D Jones, Pelin Cayirlioglu, Ilona Grunwald Kadow, Leslie B Vosshall"

Double-labelled in situ hybridization reveals the lack of co-localization of mRNAs for the circadian neuropeptide PDF and FMRFamide in brains of the flies Musca domestica and Drosophila melanogaster,17426155,10.1093/jb/mvm094,"Many lines of evidence have suggested that neuropeptides other than pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) are involved in regulating insect circadian rhythms, and FMRFamide-related peptides are additional candidates acting as such neuromodulators. Double-immunolabelling in insect brains with anti-crustacean beta-PDH and anti-FMRFamide antibodies had previously suggested that insect PDF and FMRFamide-like peptides may coexist in the same cells. However, it is critical for this kind of comparative investigations to use antibodies of proven specificity, to eliminate the possibility of both reciprocal cross-reactivity and the detection of unknown peptides. In the present study, we achieved the cDNA cloning of an fmrf mRNA from the housefly Musca domestica, for which co-localization of FMRFamide and PDF peptides was previously suggested. In order to examine the possible co-expression of this gene with the pdf gene, we carried out double-labelled in situ hybridization for simultaneous detection of both pdf and fmrf mRNAs in housefly, Musca brains.

CTCF-dependent chromatin boundary element between the latency-associated transcript and ICP0 promoters in the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome,17267480,10.1128/JVI.02447-06,"Cells latently infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) contain nucleosomal DNA similar to that of host cell chromatin. Recent studies have demonstrated that histones in the latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter and intron regions contain histone modifications permissive for transcription. However, those histones associated with the lytic-specific ICP0 gene, which lies only 5 kb away, contain modifications typical of silenced chromatin. How this active chromatin is kept separate from the repressed chromatin in the nearby ICP0 region remains crucial to the understanding of the HSV lytic cycle. In this study, we show that the LAT intron region contains an insulator. Specifically, we show that an 800-bp region from the LAT intron can block enhancers in both tissue culture cells and Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Importantly, the 800-bp HSV insulator protects a LAT transgene from positional effects in Drosophila eye tissue. The 800-bp region contains nine copies of 16-bp repeats. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that CTCF interacts with the CTCCC sequence within the repeats. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CTCF interacts with these repeats in latently infected trigeminal ganglion neurons. The deletion of these repeats impaired insulator activity in human K562 cells and Drosophila embryos. Finally, double-spaced RNA knockdown of CTCF disrupts enhancer-blocking activity of the LAT insulator in transfected Drosophila S3 cells. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the 800-bp DNA in the LAT intron region works as a chromatin boundary during latency to separate active chromatin associated with the LAT promoter region from repressed chromatin in the ICP0 gene.",2007,"Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou, Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou"
Differential Delta expression underlies the diversity of sensory organ patterns among the legs of the Drosophila adult,17107776,10.1016/j.mod.2006.09.004,"Many studies have shown that morphological diversity among homologous animal structures is generated by the homeotic (Hox) genes. However, the mechanisms through which Hox genes specify particular morphological features are not fully understood. We have addressed this issue by investigating how diverse sensory organ patterns are formed among the legs of the Drosophila melanogaster adult. The Drosophila adult has one pair of legs on each of its three thoracic segments (the T1-T3 segments). Although homologous, legs from different segments have distinct morphological features. Our focus is on the formation of diverse patterns of small mechanosensory bristles or microchaetae (mCs) among the legs. On T2 legs, the mCs are organized into a series of longitudinal rows (L-rows) precisely positioned along the leg circumference. The L-rows are observed on all three pairs of legs, but additional and novel pattern elements are found on T1 and T3 legs. For example, at specific positions on T1 and T3 legs, some mCs are organized into transverse rows (T-rows). Our studies indicate that the T-rows on T1 and T3 legs are established as a result of Hox gene modulation of the pathway for patterning the L-row mC bristles. Our findings suggest that the Hox genes, Sex combs reduced (Scr) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx), establish differential expression of the proneural gene achaete (ac) by modifying expression of the ac prepattern regulator, Delta (Dl), in T1 and T3 legs, respectively. This study identifies Dl as a potential link between Hox genes and the sensory organ patterning hierarchy, providing insight into the connection between Hox gene function and the formation of specific morphological features.",2007,"Stuti Shroff, Meghana Joshi, Teresa V Orenic, Stuti Shroff, Meghana Joshi, Teresa V Orenic"

Here, we analyze at genetic, molecular, and biochemical levels the Drosophila melanogaster p52 (DMP52) subunit of TFIIH. We found that DMP52 is encoded by the gene marionette in Drosophila and that a defective DMP52 produces UV light-sensitive flies and specific phenotypes during development: organisms are smaller than their wild-type siblings and present tumors and chromosomal instability. The human homologue of DMP52 partially rescues some of these phenotypes. Some of the defects observed in the fly caused by mutations in DMP52 generate trichothiodystrophy and cancer-like phenotypes. Biochemical analysis of DMP52 point mutations introduced in human p52 at positions homologous to those of defects in DMP52 destabilize the interaction between p52 and XPB, another TFIIH subunit, thus compromising the assembly of the complex.

Classical reward conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,16740144,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00241.x,"Negatively reinforced olfactory conditioning has been widely employed to identify learning and memory genes, signal transduction pathways and neural circuitry in Drosophila. To delineate the molecular and cellular processes underlying reward-mediated learning and memory, we developed a novel assay system for positively reinforced olfactory conditioning. In this assay, flies were involuntarily exposed to the appetitive unconditioned stimulus sucrose along with a conditioned stimulus odour during training and their preference for the odour previously associated with sucrose was measured to assess learning and memory capacities. After one training session, wild-type Canton S flies displayed reliable performance, which was enhanced after two training cycles with 1-min or 15-min inter-training intervals. Higher performance scores were also obtained with increasing sucrose concentration. Memory in Canton S flies decayed slowly when measured at 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after training; whereas, it had declined significantly at 6 h and 12 h post-training. When learning mutant t beta h flies, which are deficient in octopamine, were challenged, they exhibited poor performance, validating the utility of this assay. As the Drosophila model offers vast genetic and transgenic resources, the new appetitive conditioning described here provides a useful tool with which to elucidate the molecular and cellular underpinnings of reward learning and memory. Similar to negatively reinforced conditioning, this reward conditioning represents classical olfactory conditioning.

      Kinetochores are large multiprotein complexes indispensable for proper chromosome segregation. Although Drosophila is a classical model organism for studies of chromosome segregation, little is known about the organization of its kinetochores.
    

    
  


        Methodology/principal findings:
      
    

    
      We employed bioinformatics, proteomics and cell biology methods to identify and analyze the interaction network of Drosophila kinetochore proteins. We have shown that three Drosophila proteins highly diverged from human and yeast Ndc80, Nuf2 and Mis12 are indeed their orthologues. Affinity purification of these proteins from cultured Drosophila cells identified a further five interacting proteins with weak similarity to subunits of the SPC105/KNL-1, MIND/MIS12 and NDC80 kinetochore complexes together with known kinetochore associated proteins such as dynein/dynactin, spindle assembly checkpoint components and heterochromatin proteins. All eight kinetochore complex proteins were present at the kinetochore during mitosis and MIND/MIS12 complex proteins were also centromeric during interphase. Their down-regulation led to dramatic defects in chromosome congression/segregation frequently accompanied by mitotic spindle elongation. The systematic depletion of each individual protein allowed us to establish dependency relationships for their recruitment onto the kinetochore. This revealed the sequential recruitment of individual members of first, the MIND/MIS12 and then, NDC80 complex.

A plasmid model system shows that Drosophila dosage compensation depends on the global acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 and is not affected by depletion of common transcription elongation chromatin marks,17875941,10.1128/MCB.00397-07,"Dosage compensation refers to the equalization of most X-linked gene products between males, which have one X chromosome and a single dose of X-linked genes, and females, which have two X's and two doses of such genes. We developed a plasmid-based model of dosage compensation that allows new experimental approaches for the study of this regulatory mechanism. In Drosophila melanogaster, an enhanced rate of transcription of the X chromosome in males is dependent upon the presence of histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16. This chromatin mark occurs throughout active transcriptional units, leading us to the conclusion that the enhanced level of transcription is achieved through an enhanced rate of RNA polymerase elongation. We used the plasmid model to demonstrate that enhancement in the level of transcription does not depend on other histone marks and factors that have been associated with the process of elongation, thereby highlighting the special role played by histone H4 acetylated at lysine 16 in this process.",2007,"Ruth Yokoyama, Antonio Pannuti, Huiping Ling, Edwin R Smith, John C Lucchesi, Ruth Yokoyama, Antonio Pannuti, Huiping Ling, Edwin R Smith, John C Lucchesi"

Rapid evolution of outer egg membrane proteins in the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup: a case of ecologically driven evolution of female reproductive traits,17244601,10.1093/molbev/msm009,"Although sexual selection has been predominantly used to explain the rapid evolution of sexual traits, eggs of oviparous organisms directly face both the challenges of sexual selection as well as natural selection (environmental challenges, survival in niches, etc.). Being the outermost membrane in most insect eggs, the chorion layer is the interface between the embryo and the environment, thereby serving to protect the egg. Adaptive ecological radiations such as divergence in ovipositional substrate usage and host-plant specializations can therefore influence the evolution of eggshell proteins. We can hypothesize that proteins localized on the outer eggshell may be affected to a greater degree by ecological challenges compared with inner eggshell proteins, and therefore, proteins localized in the outer eggshell (chorion membrane) may evolve differently (faster) than proteins localized in the inner egg membrane (vitelline membrane). We compared the evolutionary divergence of vitelline with chorion membrane proteins in species of the melanogaster subgroup and found that chorion proteins as a group are indeed evolving faster than vitelline membrane proteins. At least one vitelline membrane protein (Vm32E), specifically localized on the outer eggshell, is also evolving faster than other vitelline membrane proteins suggesting that all proteins localized on the outer eggshell may be evolving rapidly. We also found evidence that specific codons in chorion proteins cp15 and cp16 are evolving under positive selection. Polymorphism surveys of cp16 revealed inflated levels of divergence relative to polymorphism in specific regions of the gene, indicating that these regions are under strong selection. At the morphological level, we found notable difference in eggshell surface morphologies between specialist (Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila erecta) and generalist species of Drosophila. We do not know if any of the chorion proteins actually interact with spermatozoids, therefore leaving the possibility of rapid evolution through gametic interaction wide open. At this point, however, our results support previous suggestions that divergences in ecology, particularly, ovipositional substrate divergences may be a strong force driving the evolution of eggshell proteins.",2007,"Santosh Jagadeeshan, Rama S Singh, Santosh Jagadeeshan, Rama S Singh"

Using a set of 76 recombinant inbred strains we identify a single quantitative trait locus, at polytene position 56A01-C11, associated with pupation site variation. We furthermore present a detailed investigation into the wandering behaviors of two strains expressing different pupation position tendencies, and identify behavioral differences. Larvae from a strain that tends to pupate relatively far from the food also tend to travel significantly farther from the media during wandering. We did not observe consistent differences in either the number or duration of wandering forays made by near or far pupating strains. The ability of larvae to integrate several internal and external environmental cues while choosing a contextually appropriate pupation site, and specifically, the variation in this ability, presents a very interesting behavioral phenotype in this highly tractable genetic model organism.",2007,"Craig A L Riedl, Marit Riedl, Trudy F C Mackay, Marla B Sokolowski, Craig A L Riedl, Marit Riedl, Trudy F C Mackay, Marla B Sokolowski"
Detection and analysis of somatic mutations at a lacZ reporter locus in higher organisms: application to Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster,17634588,10.1007/978-1-59745-361-5_20,"Methods to detect and analyze somatic mutations in higher organisms are critically important in view of their causal role in cancer, heritable diseases, and, possibly, aging. Here, we describe detailed protocols for the use of a mutational reporter system based on lacZ-containing plasmids integrated in the germline of Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. Plasmids containing the bacterial lacZ gene integrated at one or more chromosomal sites can be excised, purified and recovered in suitable Escherichia coli hosts allowing the positive selection of mutant lacZ genes and their further molecular characterization. This system is capable of detecting a broad range of mutational events, varying from small mutations in the lacZ reporter gene to large genome rearrangements with one breakpoint in lacZ and the other breakpoint elsewhere in the genome.",2007,"Ana Maria Garcia, Rita A Busuttil, Armando Rodriguez, Carlos Cabrera, Martha Lundell, Martijn E T DollÃ©, Jan Vijg, Ana Maria Garcia, Rita A Busuttil, Armando Rodriguez, Carlos Cabrera, Martha Lundell, Martijn E T DollÃ©, Jan Vijg"
Evolutionary rate analyses of orthologs and paralogs from 12 Drosophila genomes,17989258,10.1101/gr.6249707,"The newly sequenced genome sequences of 11 Drosophila species provide the first opportunity to investigate variations in evolutionary rates across a clade of closely related species. Protein-coding genes were predicted using established Drosophila melanogaster genes as templates, with recovery rates ranging from 81%-97% depending on species divergence and on genome assembly quality. Orthology and paralogy assignments were shown to be self-consistent among the different Drosophila species and to be consistent with regions of conserved gene order (synteny blocks). Next, we investigated the rates of diversification among these species' gene repertoires with respect to amino acid substitutions and to gene duplications. Constraints on amino acid sequences appear to have been most pronounced on D. ananassae and least pronounced on D. simulans and D. erecta terminal lineages. Codons predicted to have been subject to positive selection were found to be significantly over-represented among genes with roles in immune response and RNA metabolism, with the latter category including each subunit of the Dicer-2/r2d2 heterodimer. The vast majority of gene duplications (96.5%) and synteny rearrangements were found to occur, as expected, within single MÃ¼ller elements. We show that the rate of ancient gene duplications was relatively uniform. However, gene duplications in terminal lineages are strongly skewed toward very recent events, consistent with either a rapid-birth and rapid-death model or the presence of large proportions of copy number variable genes in these Drosophila populations. Duplications were significantly more frequent among trypsin-like proteases and DM8 putative lipid-binding domain proteins.",2007,"Andreas Heger, Chris P Ponting, Andreas Heger, Chris P Ponting"
A family of chemoreceptors in Tribolium castaneum (Tenebrionidae: Coleoptera),18091992,10.1371/journal.pone.0001319,"Chemoperception in invertebrates is mediated by a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). To date nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms of chemoperception in coleopteran species. Recently the genome of Tribolium castaneum was sequenced for use as a model species for the Coleoptera. Using blast searches analyses of the T. castaneum genome with previously predicted amino acid sequences of insect chemoreceptor genes, a putative chemoreceptor family consisting of 62 gustatory receptors (Grs) and 26 olfactory receptors (Ors) was identified. The receptors have seven transmembrane domains (7TMs) and all belong to the GPCR receptor family. The expression of the T. castaneum chemoreceptor genes was investigated using quantification real- time RT-PCR and in situ whole mount RT-PCR analysis in the antennae, mouth parts, and prolegs of the adults and larvae. All of the predicted TcasGrs were expressed in the labium, maxillae, and prolegs of the adults but TcasGr13, 19, 28, 47, 62, 98, and 61 were not expressed in the prolegs. The TcasOrs were localized only in the antennae and not in any of the beetles gustatory organs with one exception; the TcasOr16 (like DmelOr83b), which was localized in the antennae, labium, and prolegs of the beetles. A group of six TcasGrs that presents a lineage with the sugar receptors subfamily in Drosophila melanogaster were localized in the lacinia of the Tribolium larvae. TcasGr1, 3, and 39, presented an ortholog to CO(2) receptors in D. melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae was recorded. Low expression of almost all of the predicted chemoreceptor genes was observed in the head tissues that contain the brains and suboesophageal ganglion (SOG). These findings demonstrate the identification of a chemoreceptor family in Tribolium, which is evolutionarily related to other insect species.",2007,"Mohatmed Abdel-Latief, Mohatmed Abdel-Latief"

Myoblast fusion in Drosophila melanogaster is mediated through a fusion-restricted myogenic-adhesive structure (FuRMAS),17146786,10.1002/dvdy.21035,"During myogenesis in Drosophila embryos, a prominent adhesive structure is formed between precursor cells and fusion-competent myoblasts (fcms).

The cytoplasmic protein Blow colocalizes with the actin plugs in fcms after cell adhesion. Furthermore, the requirement of additional as yet unidentified components was demonstrated by using mammalian C2C12 myoblasts. In this study, we propose that the fusion-restricted myogenic-adhesive structure (FuRMAS) is pivotal in linking cell adhesion as well as local F-actin assembly and dynamics to downstream events that ultimately lead to plasma membrane fusion.

Therefore, establishment of baculovirus infection conditions is the first important step and this should be properly optimized for production yield. We used statistical methodology to optimize the baculovirus infection conditions using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter protein. Consequently, we arrived at optimal infection conditions through a statistical regression method.

"Restrictive flamenco alleles are maintained in Drosophila melanogaster population cages, despite the absence of their endogenous gypsy retroviral targets",17119009,10.1093/molbev/msl176,"The flamenco (flam) locus, located at 20A1-3 in the centromeric heterochromatin of the Drosophila melanogaster X chromosome, is a major regulator of the gypsy/mdg4 endogenous retrovirus. In restrictive strains, functional flam alleles maintain gypsy proviruses in a repressed state. By contrast, in permissive strains, proviral amplification results from infection of the female germ line and subsequent insertions into the chromosomes of the progeny. A restrictive/permissive polymorphism prevails in natural and laboratory populations. This polymorphism was assumed to be maintained by the interplay of opposite selective forces; on one hand, the increase of genetic load caused by proviral insertions would favor restrictive flam alleles because they make flies resistant to these gypsy replicative transpositions and, on the other, a hypothetical resistance cost would select against such alleles in the absence of the retrovirus. However, the population cage data presented in this paper do not fit with this simple resistance cost hypothesis because restrictive alleles were not eliminated in the absence of functional gypsy proviruses; on the contrary, using 2 independent flam allelic pairs, the restrictive frequency rose to about 90% in every experimental population, whatever the pair of alleles and the allelic proportions in the initial inoculum. These data suggest that the flam polymorphism is maintained by some strong balancing selection, which would act either on flam itself, independently of the deleterious effect of gypsy, or on a hypothetical flanking gene, in linkage disequilibrium with flam. Alternatively, restrictive flam alleles might also be resistant to some other retroelements that would be still present in the cage populations, causing a positive selection for these alleles. Whatever selective forces that maintain high levels of restrictive alleles independently of gypsy, this unknown mechanism can set up an interesting kind of antiviral innate immunity, at the population level.",2007,"Alain PÃ©lisson, GeneviÃ¨ve Payen-GroschÃªne, Christophe Terzian, Alain Bucheton, Alain PÃ©lisson, GeneviÃ¨ve Payen-GroschÃªne, Christophe Terzian, Alain Bucheton"

Previous studies have reported various results (e.g. no effect of age) and the present article further characterizes this task by studying the possible effects of: (1) the intensity of the stimuli (quantity of water or concentration of quinine), (2) various delays between two learning sessions on the learning score at the second session, (3) the rutabaga learning mutation on the learning score. More concentrated quinine solutions increased learning scores but the quantity of water had no effect. Learning scores at the second session were higher with shorter delays between the two learning sessions and retrograde amnesia could decrease this memory score. rutabaga mutants showed learning deficits as in experiments testing groups of flies.

Aside from opening calcium channels, their in vivo mode of action during pathogenesis remains largely uncharacterized. To better understand the effects of a Destruxin, we looked at changes in gene expression following injection of Destruxin A into the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Microarray results revealed reduced expression of various antimicrobial peptides that play a major role in the humoral immune response of the fly. Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers. Mortality due to sepsis was rescued through ectopic activation of components in the IMD pathway, one of two signal transduction pathways that are responsible for antimicrobial peptide induction. These results demonstrate a novel role for Destruxin A in specific suppression of the humoral immune response in insects.",2007,"Subhamoy Pal, Raymond J St Leger, Louisa P Wu, Subhamoy Pal, Raymond J St Leger, Louisa P Wu"

Here we show that POF and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are involved in the global regulation of the 4th chromosome. Contrary to previous conclusions, Pof is not essential for survival of diplo-4th karyotype flies. However, Pof is essential for survival of haplo-4th individuals and expression of chromosome 4 genes in diplo-4th individuals is decreased in the absence of Pof. Mapping of POF using chromatin immunoprecipitation suggested that it binds within genes. Furthermore, we show that POF binding is dependent on heterochromatin and that POF and HP1 bind interdependently to the 4th chromosome. We propose a balancing mechanism involving POF and HP1 that provides a feedback system for fine-tuning expression status of genes on the 4th chromosome.",2007,"Anna-Mia Johansson, Per Stenberg, Carolina Bernhardsson, Jan Larsson, Anna-Mia Johansson, Per Stenberg, Carolina Bernhardsson, Jan Larsson"

Flies homozygous for this allele were viable, without obvious defects, and fertile, indicating Hsp27 is not essential for development. In stress-response tests, loss of the Hsp27 gene caused no defects in resistance to heat shock or oxidative treatments. However, a significant reduction in starvation resistance was associated with the genotype without a functional Hsp27 gene.

The heterochromatic members of the family show a reduced CG content and increased variation in DNA sequence. We show that the CG reduction applies broadly to the protein-coding sequences of genes located at the heterochromatin:euchromatin interface, with a very strong correlation between CG content and the distance from centric heterochromatin. We also observe a similar trend in the transition from telomeric heterochromatin to euchromatin.

The results have shown that infected females have longer lifespan and competitiveness than females with the same genotype uninfected with Wolbachia. The increase in the senescence and mortality rates with age was also slower in infected females.

The Drosophila meiotic recombination gene mei-9 encodes a homologue of the yeast excision repair protein Rad1,8647398,,"Meiotic recombination and DNA repair are mediated by overlapping sets of genes.

The Drosophila melanogaster mei-9 gene is unique among known recombination genes in that it is required for both meiotic recombination and NER. We have analyzed the mei-9 gene at the molecular level and found that it encodes a homologue of the S. cerevisiae excision repair protein Rad1, the probable homologue of mammalian XPF/ERCC4. Hence, the predominant process of meiotic recombination in Drosophila proceeds through a pathway that is at least partially distinct from that of S. cerevisiae, in that it requires an NER protein.

A significant genetic variance was observed for some enzyme activities. The mutations which alter the enzyme activities are called modifier mutations. The magnitudes of the genetic variance in modifier mutations differed greatly among enzymes but were often similar between two series of mutation accumulation lines (AW and JH).

Extent and character of circadian gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster: identification of twenty oscillating mRNAs in the fly head,8749395,10.1016/s0960-9822(95)00280-6,"Background:
      
    

    
      Although mRNAs expressed with a circadian rhythm have been isolated from many species, the extent and character of circadianly regulated gene expression is unknown for any animal. In Drosophila melanogaster, only the period (per) gene, an essential component of the circadian pacemaker, is known to show rhythmic mRNA expression. Recent work suggests that the encoded Per protein controls its own transcription by an autoregulatory feedback loop. Per might also control the rhythmic expression of other genes to generate circadian behavior and physiology. The goals of this work were to evaluate the extent and character of circadian control of gene expression in Drosophila, and to identify genes dependent on per for circadian expression.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A large collection of anonymous, independent cDNA clones was used to screen for transcripts that are rhythmically expressed in the fly head. 20 of the 261 clones tested detected mRNAs with a greater than two-fold daily change in abundance. Three mRNAs were maximally expressed in the morning, whereas 17 mRNAs were most abundant in the evening--when per mRNA is also maximally expressed (but when the flies are inactive). Further analysis of the three 'morning' cDNAs showed that each has a unique dependence on the presence of a light-dark cycle, on timed feeding, and on the function of the per gene for its oscillation. These dependencies were different from those determined for per and for a novel 'evening' gene. Sequence analysis indicated that all but one of the 20 cDNAs identified previously uncloned genes.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Diurnal control of gene expression is a significant but limited phenomenon in the fly head, which involves many uncharacterized genes. Diurnal control is mediated by multiple endogenous and exogenous mechanisms, even at the level of individual genes. A subset of circadianly expressed genes are predominantly or exclusively dependent on per for their rhythmic expression. The per gene can therefore influence the expression of genes other than itself, but for many rhythmically expressed genes, per functions in conjunction with external inputs to control their daily expression patterns.",1995,"R N Van Gelder, H Bae, M J Palazzolo, M A Krasnow, R N Van Gelder, H Bae, M J Palazzolo, M A Krasnow"

Here we identify and purify from adult Drosophila heads an anti-HRP-reactive Mr 42K glycoprotein that is likely to be the major contributor to neuronal specific anti-HRP staining. Several different monoclonal antibodies to the purified 42K glycoprotein recognize up to three proteins with distinct mobilities between Mr 38K and 42K that vary as a function of developmental age. We have collectively named these components Nervana (nerve antigen), because the monoclonal antibodies also specifically stain cultured neurons and embryonic nervous system with a pattern indistinguishable from anti-HRP staining. Western blots indicate the presence of immunologically similar proteins in a wide variety of insect species and in nac (neurally altered carbohydrate) mutant Drosophila flies that lack anti-HRP staining in adult nervous system. It should now be possible to undertake a full biochemical and functional characterization of Nervana in Drosophila.",1995,"B Sun, P M Salvaterra, B Sun, P M Salvaterra"
Selection for increased female sexual receptivity in raised stocks of Drosophila melanogaster,7575359,10.1007/BF02197279,"Two third-chromosome mutations in raised (rsd) stocks, when homozygous, cause the wings of Drosophila melanogaster adults to be held upright. Males expressing these mutations cannot vibrate their wings to produce the courtship song, which functions to increase female receptivity to copulation. As expected, rsd males are less successful when courting wild-type females. However, females from long-established rsd stocks are more receptive to courtship stimuli and mate more readily with both rsd and wild-type males than do wild-type females. Genetic analysis reveals dominant factors on the X and third chromosomes that, in combination, are responsible for the increased receptivity of rsd females. These observations suggest that the lack of courtship song in rsd stocks, which would be expected to reduce the vigor of the stock, may have functioned as a selective force, favoring mutations that increased female receptivity. Possible consequences of selection favoring the development of differential female receptivity on speciation are discussed.",1995,"S P McRobert, F B Schnee, L Tompkins, S P McRobert, F B Schnee, L Tompkins"
Paraquat resistance and starvation conditions in the selection of longevity extremes in Drosophila melanogaster populations previously selected for long and short developmental period,8641053,10.1002/dvg.1020170408,"This paper analyzes the interaction between resistance to free radicals, development under starvation conditions, sex, and its consequences to the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for developmental time and longevity.

Differences in DNA sequence recognition by the heat-shock factors of Drosophila melanogaster and the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni,7578247,10.1016/0167-4781(95)00151-6,"It was recently shown that schistosome extracts contain heat-shock factor (HSF) activity that correlates with the pattern of hsp70 mRNA levels at different developmental stages of the parasite (Levy-Holtzman and Schechter (1994) Parasitology 108, 35-42). To extend our understanding of the HSF activity revealed in extracts of Schistosoma mansoni (Sm), it was further analyzed by competition experiments and compared with the well characterized HSF of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). The interactions of HSF in Sm extracts (SmHSF) and HSF of Dm (DmHSF) with 32P-labeled heat shock element (HSE) probes, with and without unlabeled competitor DNA probes (HSE-related oligos), were analyzed by gel retardation assay. The binding and inhibition studies demonstrated that SmHSF and DmHSF differ in HSE sequence recognition: an array of three nGAAn inverted repeats according to the ideal consensus sequence (nGAAnnTTCnnGAAn) is recognized by DmHSF, but not by SmHSF. In the schistosome, binding is attained only when the third pentamer is a variant, composed of nGTAn instead of nGAAn. The presence of this variant in the promoter of the hsp70 gene of the parasite suggests coevolution of the variant sequence together with the SmHSF which interacts efficiently with the variant, but not with the ideal HSE sequence. Further inhibition studies revealed additional differences between SmHSF and DmHSF in recognition of the first and second nGAAn pentamers of HSE. In analogy to other systems of ligand-protein interactions, we propose that the complementarity between the HSE ligand and the HSF protein is higher in SmHSF, as compared to DmHSF.",1995,"R Levy-Holtzman, J Clos, I Schechter, R Levy-Holtzman, J Clos, I Schechter"
A microinjection technique using Drosophila melanogaster for bioassay-guided isolation of neurotoxins in arthropod venoms,8866612,10.1016/0041-0101(95)00107-7,"Modern analytical techniques permit isolation and structural determination of neurotoxins at the picomole level. However, bioassay-guided fractionation of the sample often relies on simple injection assays using insects, vertebrates or crustaceans of a fairly large size, thus consuming quite a large amount of the samples being investigated. In order to investigate samples of very small size, we have devised an insect microinjection method using glass micropipettes and Drosophila melanogaster adults as test insects. The validity of the method was tested with a series of six buthoid scorpion venoms (Androctonus australis, Buthotus judaicus, Buthus tamulus, Centruroides sculpturatus, Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, Tityus serrulatus) and one chactoid scorpion (Scorpio maurus palmatus) as standards. The LD50S of the venoms were determined using both the microinjection method and a classical injection assay with crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) as test insects. Results demonstrated that the new method can successfully be applied to the study of insect neurotoxic activity in arthropod venoms. The Gryllus:Drosophila ratio in amount of sample utilized is 100. However, for all Buthoid venoms tested, except L. quinquestriatus, Drosophila showed less sensitivity, thus reducing the gain by a factor of 2-10. Drosophila were several times more sensitive to the only chactoid venom tested. These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using this microtechnique, when limited amounts of material are available for both chemical and biological work.",1995,"P Escoubas, M F Palma, T Nakajima, P Escoubas, M F Palma, T Nakajima"
Superoxide anion generation in Drosophila during melanotic encapsulation of parasites,8690025,,"Quinoid precursors of melanin and/or reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during melanogenesis have been implicated as cytotoxic molecules in the immune responses of insects against their internal metazoan parasites. No study has yet identified the killing components produced in conjunction with melanotic encapsulation responses, or explained how cytotoxic molecules generated in the open circulatory system of an insect can selectively destroy foreign tissues. Strains of Drosophila melanogaster with differing immune capabilities against the wasp parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were examined for superoxide anion (O2-.) formation during parasitization. Elevated levels of O2-. were produced by immune reactive (R-strain) hosts during melanotic encapsulation of the parasitoid, but not by susceptible (S-strain) hosts in which the parasitoid developed unmolested. Both a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-deficient strain (cSODn108, red/TM3/Sb Ser) and a catalase (CAT)-deficient strain (Catn1) also produced melanotic capsules and elevated levels of O2-. when infected, but these reactions were unsuccessful and the parasitoids survived, indicating that neither the quinoid precursors of melanin nor O2-. per se were cytotoxic. Immune incompetence in SOD-deficient and CAT-deficient hosts is attributed in part to defects in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) metabolism, and/or the inability of these metalloenzyme-deficient strains to initiate the metal-mediated reductive cleavage of H2O2 required for the production of the cytotoxic hydroxyl radical (.OH). The role proposed for O2-. in Drosophila cellular immunity is one of potentiating the formation of .OH. Melanin, which contains both oxidizing and reducing components, may serve a dual role in producing O2-. and sequestering redox-active metal ions, thereby confining the production of ROS. Host-parasite susceptibility in the Drosophila-Leptopilina system may be determined by the ability of the parasitoid to modulate hemocyte activity and prevent both effective melanotic encapsulation and the generation of cytotoxic levels of ROS.",1995,"A J Nappi, E Vass, F Frey, Y Carton, A J Nappi, E Vass, F Frey, Y Carton"

The transcript encoding this isoform, which we called 'minor-myosin', initiates within the intron between exons 12 and 13 of the muscle myosin heavy chain (mMHC) gene. Minor-myosin contains a common myosin tail but no ordinary myosin head domain. Instead, it has a short N-terminal domain which displays similarity with the N-termini of certain myosin light chain proteins. Western blots with male germ line mutants showed that the novel mMHC isoform is synthesized in the male germ cells, mainly postmeiotically. However, minor-myosin is not testis-specific, as it is expressed at a low level in the fly carcasses. The possible functions of the myosin isoform in the male germ line are discussed.",1995,"K Miedema, M Hanske, A Akhmanova, P Bindels, W Hennig, K Miedema, M Hanske, A Akhmanova, P Bindels, W Hennig"
Physiological genetics of the response to a high-sucrose diet by Drosophila melanogaster,7575391,10.1007/BF00554727,"A diet medium containing 10% (w/v) sucrose can be inferred to be stressful to Drosophila melanogaster from the increased developmental time and reduced size and fecundity of emerging flies. The metabolic basis for this stress and the genetic response to it are of interest from the point of view of both metabolic regulation and the evolutionary genetics of adaptation to stress. Here the effects of a high-sucrose diet on live weight, total protein, stored lipid and glycogen, and crude activities of 12 enzymes involved in energy metabolism were quantified. Assays were done on a large population of Drosophila that had been acclimated to the laboratory. A collection of eggs was divided to produce two replicate populations maintained on standard medium and two replicates maintained on high-sucrose medium for 133 generations. At the end of this period, both control and sucrose-selected populations were tested on standard and on high-sucrose medium. Results showed that the immediate effect of the high-sucrose diet (compared to standard medium) for both populations was a reduction in live weight and total protein, and activities of many of the enzymes were also reduced by the sucrose treatment, even after adjusting for the weight effect. Selection resulted in several changes on both the standard and the sucrose medium, but the direction of change was not always the same as the acute effect. In no case was there a significant medium by selection-treatment interaction. The pattern of phenotypic correlations did not resolve the reasons for the direction of the genetic responses. Correlations were generally stable across diets and after selection, but there were notable exceptions.",1995,"L Wang, A G Clark, L Wang, A G Clark"

Moreover, the mus308 mutation has been proposed as an animal model for the study of Fanconi's anemia. In order to obtain more information about the function controlled by this locus, we have measured the mutability of the mus308 mutant to several mutagens with different modes of action using the sex-linked recessive lethal test. We show that this mutation confers hypermutability not only to the cross-linking agents tested, hexamethylphosphoramide and hexamethylmelamine, but to the point mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea as well, whereas the response to methyl methanesulfonate was normal. The results suggest that the mus308 locus is not defective in a repair pathway specific for cross-links but is rather involved in a step of a more general post-replication repair process responsible for the removal of non-excised adducts.",1995,"I Aguirrezabalaga, L M Sierra, M A Comendador, I Aguirrezabalaga, L M Sierra, M A Comendador"

To determine the mechanism of promoter selectivity, we have analyzed the activity of the Adh promoters both in vitro and in transfected cells. We found that selective promoter utilization is controlled by distinct initiator elements. Reconstitution of Adh transcription with purified components requires a specific TBP-TAF complex that, in concert with TFIIA, directs differential Adh promoter transcription. Fractionation of this TBP-TAF complex reveals that TAFII150 is required for discrimination between the proximal and distal promoters.

From two cycles of screening of the original 575 stocks, one stock (# 687) which showed high insemination rate was selected and was backcrossed to a w strain to substitute the background. We obtained a stock which showed 10% insemination rate with D. simulans males (control was 0%). No stocks exhibiting a high crossability with D. simulans females were acquired. Revertant strains, from which the P element had been lost, were obtained from the backcrossed # 687 stock. The insemination rates of 13 revertants to D. simulans males ranged from 1% to 33%. Seven of these 13 were not significantly different from the control line but were significantly different from the backcrossed # 687 stock.

Blocking actions of the novel insecticide, fipronil, were examined on GABA responses recorded from Xenopus oocytes expressing either wild type (dieldrin-sensitive) or mutant (dieldrin-resistant) forms of the Drosophila melanogaster GABA-gated chloride channel homo-oligomer, RDL (the product of the resistance to dieldrin locus: Rdl). 2. In the case of the wild type receptor, fipronil blocked GABA-induced currents inducing both a shift to the right in the GABA dose-response curve and depressing the maximum amplitude of responses to GABA. The potency of fipronil was dependent on the GABA concentration but was unaffected by membrane potential. 3. Mutant RDL GABA-receptors, which have a naturally occurring amino acid substitution (A302-->S) in the putative ion-channel lining region, conferring resistance to dieldrin and picrotoxinin, were markedly less sensitive to fipronil than the wild-type receptors. 4. Fipronil antagonism is qualitatively similar to that produced by the structurally distinct compound, picrotoxinin. As the mutation A302-->S reduces the potency of both fipronil and picrotoxinin, homooligomeric RDL receptors should facilitate detailed studies of the molecular basis of convulsant/insecticide antagonist actions on GABA receptors.",1995,"A M Hosie, H A Baylis, S D Buckingham, D B Sattelle, A M Hosie, H A Baylis, S D Buckingham, D B Sattelle"

"Dissociation of photoreceptors from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster",7781044,10.1007/BF00307821,"Photoreceptor cells that were mostly free of extracellular material and suitable for most electrophysiological study procedures were dissociated from whole heads of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by a simple ""smash"" technique employing gentle chopping by a razor blade through Parafilm sheets. A variety of commonly available proteolytic and glycolytic digestion enzymes were tested as additions to the basic dissociation procedure described. With the aid of Nomarski interference contrast optics, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and fluorescent labeling and microscopy methods, it was determined that proteolytic enzymatic digestion does little to enhance the dissociation procedure, and instead, often damages the cells that one is attempting to recover. Unexpectedly, certain glycolytic enzymes, when added to the basic procedure, appear to enhance the recovery of intact viable Drosophila photoreceptors that are stripped of most extracellular material. Based on these results, a hypothesis concerning the biochemical nature of the extracellular matrix of the Drosophila retina is proposed. Drosophila photoreceptors are an interesting model system for the study of invertebrate phototransduction and photoreceptor cell biology because of their many well-characterized mutant strains.

White as a reporter gene to detect transcriptional silencers specifying position-specific gene expression during Drosophila melanogaster eye development,8582614,,"The white+ gene was used as a reporter to detect transcriptional silencer activity in the Drosophila genome. Changes in the spatial expression pattern of white were scored in the adult eye as nonuniform patterns of pigmentation. Thirty-six independent P[lacW] transposant lines were collected. These represent 12 distinct pigmentation patterns and probably 21 loci. The spatial pigmentation pattern is due to cis-acting suppression of white+ expression, and the suppression probably depends on cell position rather than cell type. The mechanism of suppression differs from inactivation by heterochromatin. In addition, activation of lacZ in P[lacW] occurs also in specific patterns in imaginal discs and embryos in many of the lines. The expression patterns of white+ and lacZ may reflect the activity of regulatory elements belonging to an endogenous gene near each P[lacW] insertion site. We speculate that these putative POSE (position-specific expression) genes may have a role in pattern formation of the eye as well as other imaginal structures.

The optic lobe of late third-instar larvae displayed ChAT immunoreactivity in Bolwig's nerve and a neuron close to the insertion site of the optic stalk. This neuron's axon ran in parallel with Bolwig's nerve to the larval optic neuropil. This neuron is likely to be a first-order interneuron of the larval visual system.

Drosophila nipped-B protein supports sister chromatid cohesion and opposes the stromalin/Scc3 cohesion factor to facilitate long-range activation of the cut gene,15060134,10.1128/mcb.24.8.3100-3111.2004,"The Drosophila melanogaster Nipped-B protein facilitates transcriptional activation of the cut and Ultrabithorax genes by remote enhancers. Sequence homologues of Nipped-B, Scc2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Mis4 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe are required for sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis. The evolutionarily conserved Cohesin protein complex mediates sister chromatid cohesion, and Scc2 and Mis4 are needed for Cohesin to associate with chromosomes. Here, we show that Nipped-B is also required for sister chromatid cohesion but that, opposite to the effect of Nipped-B, the stromalin/Scc3 component of Cohesin inhibits long-range activation of cut. To explain these findings, we propose a model based on the chromatin domain boundary activities of Cohesin in which Nipped-B facilitates cut activation by alleviating Cohesin-mediated blocking of enhancer-promoter communication.",2004,"Robert A Rollins, Maria Korom, Nathalie Aulner, Andrew Martens, Dale Dorsett, Robert A Rollins, Maria Korom, Nathalie Aulner, Andrew Martens, Dale Dorsett"
The slowpoke channel binding protein Slob from Drosophila melanogaster exhibits regulatable protein kinase activity,15234468,10.1016/j.neulet.2004.04.043,"The slowpoke channel binding protein Slob from Drosophila melanogaster contains a putative protein kinase domain within its amino acid sequence. We find that Slob exhibits weak and barely detectable protein kinase activity in vitro, as evidenced by autophosphorylation and by phosphorylation of exogenously added histone as substrate. The phosphorylation of histone is enhanced markedly when Slob is pretreated with the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAc). Mass spectrometric and mutational analysis demonstrates that the major site of phosphorylation by PKAc within Slob is serine 54. The enhancement of Slob kinase activity by PKAc pretreatment is eliminated when serine 54 in Slob is mutated to alanine (S54A). Furthermore, Slob kinase activity is enhanced in an S54E mutant that mimics phosphorylation at serine 54, and there is no further enhancement of S54E Slob kinase activity by pretreatment with PKAc. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that Slob exhibits regulatable protein kinase activity, whose activity is enhanced by phosphorylation at serine 54.",2004,"Haoyu Zeng, Hong Fei, Irwin B Levitan, Haoyu Zeng, Hong Fei, Irwin B Levitan"
GABAergic modulation of motor-driven behaviors in juvenile Drosophila and evidence for a nonbehavioral role for GABA transport,15389689,10.1002/neu.20061,"We have identified specific GABAergic-modulated behaviors in the juvenile stage of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster via systemic treatment of second instar larvae with the potent GABA transport inhibitor DL-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (DABA). DABA significantly inhibited motor-controlled body wall and mouth hook contractions and impaired rollover activity and contractile responses to touch stimulation. The perturbations in locomotion and rollover activity were reminiscent of corresponding DABA-induced deficits in locomotion and the righting reflex observed in adult flies. The effects were specific to these motor-controlled behaviors, because DABA-treated larvae responded normally in olfaction and phototaxis assays. Recovery of these behaviors was achieved by cotreatment with the vertebrate GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Pharmacological studies performed in vitro with plasma membrane vesicles isolated from second instar larval tissues verified the presence of high-affinity, saturable GABA uptake mechanisms. GABA uptake was also detected in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from behaviorally quiescent stages. Competitive inhibition studies of [3H]-GABA uptake into plasma membrane vesicles from larval and pupal tissues with either unlabeled GABA or the transport inhibitors DABA, nipecotic acid, or valproic acid, revealed differences in affinities. GABAergic-modulation of motor behaviors is thus conserved between the larval and adult stages of Drosophila, as well as in mammals and other vertebrate species. The pharmacological studies reveal shared conservation of GABA transport mechanisms between Drosophila and mammals, and implicate the involvement of GABA and GABA transporters in regulating physiological processes distinct from neurotransmission during behaviorally quiescent stages of development.",2004,"Sandra M Leal, Nitin Kumar, Wendi S Neckameyer, Sandra M Leal, Nitin Kumar, Wendi S Neckameyer"
How two Afrotropical endemics made two cosmopolitan human commensals: the Drosophila melanogaster-D. simulans palaeogeographic riddle,15088644,10.1023/b:gene.0000017627.27537.ef,"Despite countless biogeographic, ecological and molecular data, the origin, age and palaeogeographic trajectory of Drosophila melanogaster or D. simulans have remained highly debatable. Even the most widely accepted views, like the place and antiquity of the wild-to-domestic behavior shift in D. melanogaster, and which of the two species arose first appear questionable. Here, we present a critical review of the conflicting hypotheses, and make testable suggestions. Although both species are cosmopolitan human commensals, they have a contrasted biogeography, ecology and history. The disappearance of the wild behavior in some or all D. melanogaster populations may date back to the 18,000 years BP post-Aterian hyperarid phase. Alternatively, D. melanogaster populations where the wild behavior would still prevail may still exist in Central Africa. The 600-fold reduction in surface that affected the Seychelles Bank 10,000 years ago, undoubtedly affected D. simulans and D. sechellia population sizes dramatically. We stress the good match between the geographical ranges of D. simulans and Morinda citrifolia, and the mismatch between D. sechellia and this rubiaceous plant, yet assumed to be its restricted host-plant. We suggest that the ecological status of the four species of the melanogaster complex may represent four steps of the same process indicating a gradual shift from specialization and local confinement to opportunism and human commensalisms.",2004,"Daniel Lachaise, Jean-FranÃ§ois Silvain"
Molecular and comparative genetics of mental retardation,15020472,10.1534/genetics.166.2.835,"Affecting 1-3% of the population, mental retardation (MR) poses significant challenges for clinicians and scientists. Understanding the biology of MR is complicated by the extraordinary heterogeneity of genetic MR disorders. Detailed analyses of >1000 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database entries and literature searches through September 2003 revealed 282 molecularly identified MR genes. We estimate that hundreds more MR genes remain to be identified. A novel test, in which we distributed unmapped MR disorders proportionately across the autosomes, failed to eliminate the well-known X-chromosome overrepresentation of MR genes and candidate genes. This evidence argues against ascertainment bias as the main cause of the skewed distribution. On the basis of a synthesis of clinical and laboratory data, we developed a biological functions classification scheme for MR genes. Metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, and transcription are the most common functions, but numerous other aspects of neuronal and glial biology are controlled by MR genes as well. Using protein sequence and domain-organization comparisons, we found a striking conservation of MR genes and genetic pathways across the approximately 700 million years that separate Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster. Eighty-seven percent have one or more fruit fly homologs and 76% have at least one candidate functional ortholog. We propose that D. melanogaster can be used in a systematic manner to study MR and possibly to develop bioassays for therapeutic drug discovery. We selected 42 Drosophila orthologs as most likely to reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms of nervous system development or plasticity relevant to MR.",2004,"Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo, Jennifer K Inlow, Linda L Restifo"
Genotype-specific responses of fluctuating asymmetry and of preadult survival to the effects of lead and temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster,14554005,10.1016/s0269-7491(03)00238-0,"Although fluctuating asymmetry (FA) increases with exposure to certain types of environmental stressors such as temperature extremes, relatively little is known about the effects of interaction (e.g., synergism) between known sources of environmental stress on FA. Knowledge of such interaction effects, and of the magnitude of genotype-by-environment interaction, are of fundamental importance toward predicting the usefulness of FA as a bioindicator of environmental pollution. We tested for synergistic effects on FA between elevated temperature and exposure to lead, and examined FA responses simultaneously in four genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster known to differ in their degree of developmental instability, and presumably in their buffering capacity. In the absence of heavy metal, bristle FA increased with temperature, but in the presence of lead, FA at high temperature (30 (degrees)C) was reduced to levels similar, or below, that at lower temperature (25 (degrees)C). This temperature by lead interaction was statistically significant, but paradoxical in that the disruptive effects of temperature appeared to be attenuated in the presence of the heavy metal. In no case was there a significant effect of lead on bristle FAs, despite documented assimilation of heavy metal by flies, and in no case was the genotype by environment interaction significant. Whereas lead treatment did not influence survival, survival was reduced at the high temperature, but significantly so only in one genetic strain (Oregon-R). There was no relationship between survival and FA across stress treatments within lines. Thus, any disproportionate stress-induced mortality in developmentally unstable classes (developmental selection) was unlikely to bias the FA results. Our results underscore the need for independent replication of significant findings before FA-based biomonitoring can be responsibly and effectively implemented. The results call for caution in using FA as a biomarker of stress, because stress factors may interact in complex and unpredictable ways, which could result in erroneous conclusions about real levels of stress present in field populations, under the unduly simplistic assumption that stress factors will act additively to increase FA.",2004,"Michal Polak, David E Kroeger, Iain L Cartwright, Claudia Ponce deLeon, Michal Polak, David E Kroeger, Iain L Cartwright, Claudia Ponce deLeon"
Molecular genetics of the Alhambra (Drosophila AF10) complex locus of Drosophila,15258852,10.1007/s00438-004-1042-4,"The Alhambra (Alh) gene is the Drosophila homologue of the human AF10 gene. AF10 has been identified as a fusion partner of MLL, a human homologue of the fly gene trithorax, in infant leukemias. The endogenous function of human AF10 is not known, but may be vital to its role in acute leukemia. This prompted us to analyse Alh function. We describe here the genetic organisation of the Alh locus in D. melanogaster. We show that an independent lethal complementation group encoding a muscle protein (Mlp84B) is located within an Alh intron. We have already shown that the leucine zipper (LZ) domain of ALH activates several Polycomb group-responsive elements. We further demonstrate that the LZ domain on its own bears the Alh vital function, since it is necessary and sufficient for rescue of Alh mutant lethality. Finally, we demonstrate that, in contrast to a previous report, Alh does not affect position-effect variegation.",2004,"L Perrin, J-M Dura, L Perrin, J-M Dura"
Differentiating germ cells can revert into functional stem cells in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries,15024390,10.1038/nature02436,"Many tissues including blood, skin, gut and germ cells are continuously maintained by tissue stem cells. Under certain conditions, however, other organs can undergo repair using stem-cell-like progenitors generated by cell de-differentiation. Cell fates have been broadened experimentally, but mechanisms allowing de-differentiation to a stem cell state are poorly known. Germline stem cells begin to differentiate by forming interconnected germ cell cysts (cystocytes), and under certain conditions male mouse cystocytes have been postulated to revert into functional progenitors. Here we report that four- and eight-cell Drosophila germline cystocytes generated either in second instar larval ovaries or in adults over-producing the BMP4-like stem cell signal Decapentaplegic efficiently convert into single stem-like cells. These de-differentiated cells can develop into functional germline stem cells and support normal fertility. Our results show that cystocytes represent a relatively abundant source of regenerative precursors that might help replenish germ cells after depletion by genotoxic chemicals, radiation or normal ageing. More generally, Drosophila cystocytes now provide a system for studying de-differentiation and its potential as a source of functional stem cells.",2004,"Toshie Kai, Allan Spradling, Toshie Kai, Allan Spradling"
Non-African populations of Drosophila melanogaster have a unique origin,15014160,10.1093/molbev/msh089,"Drosophila melanogaster is widely used as a model in DNA variation studies. Patterns of polymorphism have, however, been affected by the history of this species, which is thought to have recently spread out of Africa to the rest of the world. We analyzed DNA sequence variation in 11 populations, including four continental African and seven non-African samples (including Madagascar), at four independent X-linked loci. Variation patterns at all four loci followed neutral expectations in all African populations, but departed from it in all non-African ones due to a marked haplotype dimorphism at three out of four loci. We also found that all non-African populations show the same major haplotypes, though in various frequencies. A parsimonious explanation for these observations is that all non-African populations are derived from a single ancestral population having undergone a substantial reduction of polymorphism, probably through a bottleneck. Less likely alternatives involve either selection at all four loci simultaneously (including balancing selection at three of them), or admixture between two divergent populations. Small but significant structure was observed among African populations, and there were indications of differentiation across Eurasia for non-African ones. Since population history may result in non-equilibrium variation patterns, our study confirms that the search for footprints of selection in the D. melanogaster genome must include a sufficient understanding of its history.",2004,"Emmanuelle Baudry, Barbara Viginier, Michel Veuille, Emmanuelle Baudry, Barbara Viginier, Michel Veuille"

It has not yet been established whether the same ancestral genetic system underlies this type of meiotic drive across the genus, but the biological characteristics and the evolutionary history of species undoubtedly determine the fate of X-linked drivers. The intragenomic conflict they trigger contributes to geographical variation in D. simulans, which shows a sharp contrast between ancestral-stock derived and recently introduced populations. In the former, sex-ratio X chromosomes are widespread and sometimes reach a high frequency, but they are inactivated by strong Y-linked and autosomal drive suppressors. In recently-introduced populations, sex-ratio X chromosomes are generally rare and suppressors are moderate or absent. We discuss how this pattern could be related to the recent geographical expansion of D. simulans, and consider possible reasons why sex-ratio drive apparently does not occur in D. melanogaster.",2004,"D Jutier, N Derome, C Montchamp-Moreau, D Jutier, N Derome, C Montchamp-Moreau"
An accelerated assay for the identification of lifespan-extending interventions in Drosophila melanogaster,15328413,10.1073/pnas.0403493101,"Recent advances in aging research have uncovered genes and genetic pathways that influence lifespan in such diverse organisms as yeast, nematodes, flies, and mice. The discovery of genes and drugs that affect lifespan has been delayed by the absence of a phenotype other than survivorship, which depends on the measurement of age at death of individuals in a population. The use of survivorship to identify genetic and pharmacological interventions that prolong life is time-consuming and requires a large number of homogeneous animals. Here, we report the development of an assay in Drosophila melanogaster using the expression of molecular biomarkers that accelerates the ability to evaluate potential lifespan-altering interventions. Coupling the expression of an age-dependent molecular biomarker to a lethal toxin reduces the time needed to perform lifespan studies by 80%. The assay recapitulates the effect of the three best known environmental life-span-extending interventions in the fly: ambient temperature, reproductive status, and calorie reduction. Single gene mutations known to extend lifespan in the fly such as Indy and rpd3 also extend lifespan in this assay. We used this assay as a screen to identify drugs that extend lifespan in flies. Lipoic acid and resveratrol were identified as being beneficial in our assay and shown to extend lifespan under normal laboratory conditions. We propose that this assay can be used to screen pharmacological as well as genetic interventions more rapidly for positive effects on lifespan.",2004,"Johannes H Bauer, Stephan Goupil, Graham B Garber, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer, Stephan Goupil, Graham B Garber, Stephen L Helfand"

Gender-selective patterns of aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,15302936,10.1073/pnas.0404693101,"Complex behaviors, such as aggression, are comprised of distinct stereospecific behavioral patterns (modules). How such patterns get wired into nervous systems remains unknown. Recently, we reported on a quantitative analysis of fighting behavior in male flies of the common Canton-S strain of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we report a similar analysis of fighting behavior in females of the same species. Fights were carried out between pairs of virgin and pairs of mated females in competition for a yeast resource. Each fight was videotaped and analyzed by using transition matrices and Markov chain analyses. We observe only small difference in fighting intensity between virgin and mated females. In contrast to what is seen in male fights, however, no clear hierarchical relationship is formed in the female fights. A further comparison of the behavioral patterns making up male and female fights reveals that some modules are shared by both sexes, whereas others are highly selective. Within the shared components, transitions between the modules also show gender-selective differences. By using the powerful genetic methods available for examining behavior in fruit flies, it should be possible to use the gender-selective differences in fighting behavior to address the question of how these behavioral patterns get established in the brains of fruit flies.",2004,"Steven P Nilsen, Yick-Bun Chan, Robert Huber, Edward A Kravitz, Steven P Nilsen, Yick-Bun Chan, Robert Huber, Edward A Kravitz"
Functional studies of shaggy/glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation sites in Drosophila melanogaster,15143183,10.1128/MCB.24.11.4909-4919.2004,"Early studies of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in mammalian systems focused on its pivotal role in glycogen metabolism and insulin-mediated signaling. It is now recognized that GSK-3 is central to a number of diverse signaling systems. Here, we show that the major form of the kinase Shaggy (Sgg), the GSK-3 fly ortholog, is negatively regulated during insulin-like/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in vivo. Since genetic studies of Drosophila melanogaster had previously shown that Wingless (Wg) signaling also acts to antagonize Sgg, we investigate how the kinase might integrate, or else discriminate, signaling inputs by Wg and insulin. Using Drosophila cell line assays, we found, in contrast to previous reports, that Wg induces accumulation of its transducer Armadillo (Arm)/beta-catenin without significant alteration of global Sgg-specific activity. In agreement with a previous study using human GSK-3beta, Wg did not cause phosphorylation changes of the Ser9 or Tyr214 regulatory phosphorylated sites of Sgg. Conversely, as shown in mammalian systems, insulin-induced inhibition of Sgg-specific activity by phosphorylation at the N-terminal pseudosubstrate site (Ser9) did not induce Arm/beta-catenin accumulation, showing selectivity in response to the different signaling pathways. Interestingly, a minigene bearing a Ser9-to-Ala change rescued mutant sgg without causing abnormal development, suggesting that the regulation of Sgg via the inhibitory pseudosubstrate domain is dispensable for many aspects of its function. Our studies of Drosophila show that Wg and insulin or PI3K pathways do not converge on Sgg but that they exhibit cross-regulatory interactions.",2004,"Deppie Papadopoulou, Michele Wolfe Bianchi, Marc Bourouis, Deppie Papadopoulou, Michele Wolfe Bianchi, Marc Bourouis"
Pygopus and Legless target Armadillo/beta-catenin to the nucleus to enable its transcriptional co-activator function,15208637,10.1038/ncb1141,"Wnt signalling controls the transcription of genes that function during normal and malignant development. Stimulation by canonical Wnt ligands activates beta-catenin (or Drosophila melanogaster Armadillo) by blocking its phosphorylation, resulting in its stabilization and translocation to the nucleus. Here, Armadillo/beta-catenin binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors and recruits chromatin-modifying and -remodelling complexes to transcribe Wnt target genes. The transcriptional activity of Armadillo/beta-catenin depends on two conserved nuclear proteins recently discovered in Drosophila, Pygopus (Pygo) and Legless/BCL-9 (Lgs). Lgs functions as an adaptor between Pygo and Armadillo/beta-catenin, but how Armadillo/beta-catenin is controlled by Pygo and Lgs is not known. Here, we show that the nuclear localization of Lgs entirely depends on Pygo, which itself is constitutively localized to the nucleus; thus, Pygo functions as a nuclear anchor. Pygo is also required for high nuclear Armadillo levels during Wingless signalling, and together with Lgs increases the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin in APC mutant cancer cells. Notably, linking Armadillo to a nuclear localization sequence rescues pygo and lgs mutant fly embryos. This indicates that Pygo and Lgs function in targeting Armadillo/beta-catenin to the nucleus, thus ensuring its availability to TCF during Wnt signalling.",2004,"Fiona M Townsley, Adam Cliffe, Mariann Bienz, Fiona M Townsley, Adam Cliffe, Mariann Bienz"

Excitatory and inhibitory switches for courtship in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster,15062094,10.1016/j.cub.2004.03.037,"Background:
      
    

    
      Courtship is the best-studied behavior in Drosophila melanogaster, and work on its anatomical basis has concentrated mainly on the functional identification of sexually dimorphic sites in the brain. Much less is known of the more expansive, nondimorphic, but nonetheless essential, neural elements subserving male courtship behavior.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Sites in the CNS mediating initiation and early steps of male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster were identified by analyzing the behavior of mosaic flies expressing transgenes designed either to suppress neurotransmission or enhance neuronal excitability. Suppression of neurotransmission was accomplished by means of the dominantly acting, temperature-sensitive dynamin mutation shibire(ts1), whereas enhanced neuronal excitability was produced by means of a novel, dominantly acting, truncated eag potassium channel. By using a new, landmark-based procedure for aligning diverse expression patterns among the various mosaic strains, a comparison of courtship performance and affected brain sites in strains expressing the transgenes identified a cluster of cells in the posterior lateral protocerebrum that exerts reciprocal effects on the initiation of courtship, suppressing it when they are inactivated and enhancing it when they are hyperactivated, indicative of cells that normally play an excitatory, triggering role. A separate group of nearby cells, slightly more anterior in the lateral protocerebrum, was found to inhibit courtship when its activity is enhanced, indicative of an inhibitory role in courtship.

All (13)C signals of the isolated glucose were multiplets arising by (13)C(13)C coupling. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the coupling constants and heavy isotope shifts in glucose, the integrals of individual (13)C signal patterns afforded the concentrations of certain groups of (13)C isotopologs.

Among the latter group, seven isotopologs were found at concentrations >0.1 mol % with [1,2-(13)C(2)]glucose as the most prominent species. The multiply (13)C-labeled glucose isotopologs are caused by metabolic remodeling of the proffered glucose via a complex network of catabolic and anabolic processes involving glycolysis and/or passage through the pentose phosphate, the Cori cycle and/or the citrate cycle.

Cholinergic control of synchronized seminal emissions in Drosophila,15084286,10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.003,"In many animal species, copulation involves the coordinated release of both sperm and seminal fluid, including substances that change female fertility and postmating behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, these substances increase female fertility and prevent mating with a second male. By using a PGal4 strain, we targeted together with other cells a dozen cholinergic neurons found only in the male abdominal ganglion (Abg-MAch). Genetic feminization apparently deleted these neurons in males and significantly increased their copulation duration, blocked their fertility in 60% of cases, and only weakly repressed remating in females. Genetic repression of Gal4 activity in all cholinergic neurons completely rescued copulation duration and fertility, and totally prevented remating, indicating that Abg-MAch neurons were functional. The conditional blocking of the synaptic activity of these neurons during copulation induced separate effects on the transfer of the seminal substances involved in fertilization and those involved in remating. These effects were dissociated only when Abg-MAch neurons were feminized, indicating that their presence is required to synchronize the emission of the male substance(s) that changes reproductive behaviors.",2004,"Angel Acebes, Yael Grosjean, Claude Everaerts, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur, Angel Acebes, Yael Grosjean, Claude Everaerts, Jean-FranÃ§ois Ferveur"
Is lifespan extension accompanied by improved antioxidant defences? A study of superoxide dismutase and catalase in Drosophila melanogaster flies that lived in hypergravity at a young age,15314276,10.1023/B:BGEN.0000038046.37590.03,"It has been previously shown that exposing Drosophila melanogaster flies to hypergravity (3g or 5g) at a young age for 2 weeks increases male longevity, resistance to heat in both sexes, and delays behavioural ageing, but the causes of these effects are unknown. We hypothesised that these flies could be well protected against free radical attacks and, if this protection persists after removal from hypergravity, can better resist free radicals and finally live longer than flies that have always lived at 1g. If so, the activity of enzymes detoxifying free radicals superoxide dismutase and catalase should be increased in flies that have lived in hypergravity. Results showed that no effect of hypergravity on the activity of these enzymes was observed at 2, 4 or 6 weeks of age. The greater longevity of male flies that have lived in hypergravity at a young age thus cannot be explained by the activity changes of these major antioxidant enzymes.",2004,"Eric Le Bourg, Didier Fournier, Eric Le Bourg, Didier Fournier"
Cross-life stage and cross-generational effects of gamma irradiations at the egg stage on Drosophila melanogaster life histories,15547320,10.1007/s10522-004-2571-2,"The long-term effects of X-irradiation with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 Gy of 1 h eggs on the fitness-related life history traits in adult Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and their offspring were investigated. Following irradiation with 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 Gy, both F0 and F1 flies have decreased adult body weight and increased locomotor (photo- and geotactic) activity, whereas metabolic rate measured as the rate of CO2 production was unchanged or even increased, and female fecundity was slightly reduced compared to appropriate controls. In some cases, irradiation resulted in hormetic effects increased resistance to both starvation and heat shock stresses as well as life extension. An explanation of the beneficial long lasting effects induced by early irradiation is offered, which suggests that these effects are due to cross-life stage and cross-generational adaptive phenotypic plasticity.",2004,"Alexander M Vaiserman, Natalya M Koshel, Ludmila V Mechova, Vladimir P Voitenko, Alexander M Vaiserman, Natalya M Koshel, Ludmila V Mechova, Vladimir P Voitenko"
Molecular evolution and population genetics of duplicated accessory gland protein genes in Drosophila,15215320,10.1093/molbev/msh195,"To investigate the potential importance of gene duplication in D. melanogaster accessory gland protein (Acp) gene evolution we carried out a computational analysis comparing annotated D. melanogaster Acp genes to the entire D. melanogaster genome. We found that two known Acp genes are actually members of small multigene families. Polymorphism and divergence data from these duplicated genes suggest that in at least four cases, protein divergence between D. melanogaster and D. simulans is a result of directional selection. One putative Acp revealed by our computational analysis shows evidence of a recent selective sweep in a non-African population (but not in an African population). These data support the idea that selection on reproduction-related genes may drive divergence of populations within species, and strengthen the conclusion that Acps may often be under directional selection in Drosophila.",2004,"Alisha K Holloway, David J Begun, Alisha K Holloway, David J Begun"
Molecular and genetic organization of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes: evidence for two types of interband regions,15609554,10.1007/s10709-004-2839-0,"The 3A and 60E regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes containing inserted copies of the P[1ArB] transposon have been subjected to an electron microscopic (EM) analysis.

Their sequences, as well as those of DNA from other four interbands described earlier, have been analyzed. We have found that, with the exception of 60E8-9/E10 interband, all other five regions under study corresponded to 5' or 3' ends of genes. We have further obtained the evidence for 60E8-9/E10 interband to harbor the 'housekeeping' RpL19 gene, which is transcribed in many tissues, including salivary glands.

Visual pattern recognition in Drosophila is invariant for retinal position,15310908,10.1126/science.1099839,"Vision relies on constancy mechanisms. Yet, these are little understood, because they are difficult to investigate in freely moving organisms. One such mechanism, translation invariance, enables organisms to recognize visual patterns independent of the region of their visual field where they had originally seen them. Tethered flies (Drosophila melanogaster) in a flight simulator can recognize visual patterns. Because their eyes are fixed in space and patterns can be displayed in defined parts of their visual field, they can be tested for translation invariance. Here, we show that flies recognize patterns at retinal positions where the patterns had not been presented before.",2004,"Shiming Tang, Reinhard Wolf, Shuping Xu, Martin Heisenberg, Shiming Tang, Reinhard Wolf, Shuping Xu, Martin Heisenberg"
Mutations in Su(var)205 and Su(var)3-7 suppress P-element-dependent silencing in Drosophila melanogaster,15579693,10.1534/genetics.104.026914,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the w(+) transgene in P[lacW]ci(Dplac) is uniformly expressed throughout the adult eye. However, when other P elements are present, this w(+) transgene is randomly silenced and this produces a variegated eye phenotype. This P-element-dependent silencing (PDS) is limited to w(+) transgenes inserted in a specific region on chromosome 4. In a screen for genetic modifiers of PDS, we isolated mutations in Su(var)205, Su(var)3-7, and two unidentified genes that suppress this variegated phenotype. Therefore, only a few of the genes encoding heterochromatic modifiers act dose dependently in PDS. In addition, we recovered two spontaneous mutations of P[lacW]ci(Dplac) that variegate in the absence of P elements. These P[lacW]i(Dplac) derivatives have a gypsy element inserted proximally to the P[lacW]ci(Dplac) insert. The same mutations that suppress PDS also suppress w(+) silencing from these P[lacW]ci(Dplac) derivative alleles. This indicates that both cis-acting changes in sequence and trans-acting P elements cause a similar change in chromatin structure that silences w(+) expression in P[lacW]ci(Dplac). Together, these results confirm that PDS occurs at P[lacW]ci(Dplac) because of the chromatin structure at this chromosomal position. Studying w(+) variegation from P[lacW]ci(Dplac) provides a model for the interactions that can enhance heterochromatic silencing at single P-element inserts.",2004,"Daniel Bushey, John Locke, Daniel Bushey, John Locke"

We report that DA specifically regulates diene hydrocarbon biosynthesis, which is female specific.

      The current study was designed to evaluate the toxicity of the secondary metabolites of Lactobacillus plantarum against the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and the Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In this study, toxicity analyses of secondary metabolites of Lactobacillus plantarum were analyzed on breast cancer cells, and the Drosophila melanogaster. After application, in the MCF-7 cell line, expression levels of RRAS-2, TP53, BCL-2, APAF-1, CASP-3, FADD, CASP-7, BOK genes; in D. melanogaster; expression levels of RAS64B P53, BUFFY, DARK, DECAY, FADD, DRICE, and DEBCL genes were determined by RT-PCR. In addition, analysis of L. plantarum secondary metabolite was performed by GC-MS method and molecular binding poses of secondary metabolites and human enzymes were investigated in silico.

      Drosophila melanogaster being used as a model organism where some of the human genes were preserved. The IC50 value of the secondary metabolite in the MCF-7 cell line was determined to be 0.0011 mg/ml. Lethal concentration 50 (LC50) and 99 (LC99) values of secondary metabolites against fruit fly adults were 0.24 mg/ml and 0.54 mg/ml, respectively.

The genetic basis of diurnal preference in Drosophila melanogaster,32862827,10.1186/s12864-020-07020-z,"Background:
      
    

    
      Most animals restrict their activity to a specific part of the day, being diurnal, nocturnal or crepuscular. The genetic basis underlying diurnal preference is largely unknown. Under laboratory conditions, Drosophila melanogaster is crepuscular, showing a bi-modal activity profile. However, a survey of strains derived from wild populations indicated that high variability among individuals exists, including flies that are nocturnal.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Using a highly diverse population, we performed an artificial selection experiment, selecting flies with extreme diurnal or nocturnal preference. After 10 generations, we obtained highly diurnal and nocturnal strains. We used whole-genome expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in diurnal, nocturnal and crepuscular (control) flies. Other than one circadian clock gene (pdp1), most differentially expressed genes were associated with either clock output (pdf, to) or input (Rh3, Rh2, msn). This finding was congruent with behavioural experiments indicating that both light masking and the circadian pacemaker are involved in driving nocturnality.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our study demonstrates that genetic variation segregating in wild populations contributes to substantial variation in diurnal preference. We identified candidate genes associated with diurnality/nocturnality, while data emerging from our expression analysis and behavioural experiments suggest that both clock and clock-independent pathways are involved in shaping diurnal preference. The diurnal and nocturnal selection strains provide us with a unique opportunity to understand the genetic architecture of diurnal preference.",2020,"Mirko Pegoraro, Laura M M Flavell, Pamela Menegazzi, Perrine Colombi, Pauline Dao, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Eran Tauber, Mirko Pegoraro, Laura M M Flavell, Pamela Menegazzi, Perrine Colombi, Pauline Dao, Charlotte Helfrich-FÃ¶rster, Eran Tauber"

Additionally, we sought to identify human orthologs of the corresponding genes as well as protein domain families. The systematic literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus databases using relevant key terms. Orthologs were predicted using the DIOPT tool and aligned protein regions were determined from the Pfam database. 3-D models of the smooth SJ proteins were built on the Phyre2 and DMPFold protein structure prediction servers. A total of 30 proteins were identified as relatives to the SJ cellular structure. Key roles of these proteins, mainly in the regulation of morphogenetic events and cellular signalling, were highlighted. The investigation of protein domain families revealed that the SJ-related proteins contain conserved domains that are required not only for cell-cell interactions and cell polarity but also for cellular signalling and immunity.

The problem of resistance has not been solved fundamentally, because the development of new insecticides can't keep pace with the development speed of resistance, and the lack of understanding of molecular mechanism of resistance. As the further analysis to reduce data noise, we constructed the direct protein-protein interaction network of insecticide resistance based on subcellular localization analysis. The interaction between proteins located at the same subcellular location belongs to direct interactions, thus eliminating indirect interaction.

The virus infects Drosophila melanogaster with no known characterized phenotype. In this study, geotaxis assays and longevity analyses were used to determine if Nora virus infection affects D. melanogaster's locomotor ability. In addition, Drosophila C virus (DCV), a well-characterized D. melanogaster virus, was used as a positive control, as it has previously shown a locomotor defect in infected flies. Stocks infected with NV (NV+) and DCV (DCV+) and virus-free (NV-/DCV-) stocks were established. Over a 3-year period, approximately 2,500 virgin female flies were tested for geotaxis and longevity using Kaplan-Meier analyses, as well as the Cox Proportional Hazards regression for survivorship. There was a significant decrease in the geotaxis when the D. melanogaster flies were infected with Nora virus compared to uninfected controls, but no difference was found between DCV+ and NV+ trials. There were not significant differences in longevity between the three groups. This is the first time that a phenotype has been recorded in association with Nora virus infection.

Developmental compartments in the larval trachea of Drosophila,26491942,10.7554/eLife.08666,"The Drosophila tracheal system is a branched tubular network that forms in the embryo by a post-mitotic program of morphogenesis. In third instar larvae (L3), cells constituting the second tracheal metamere (Tr2) reenter the cell cycle.

These boundaries corresponded to domains of gene expression, for example where cells expressing Spalt, Delta and Serrate in the dorsal trunk meet vein-expressing cells in the dorsal branch or transverse connective. Notch signaling was activated to one side of these borders and was required for the identity, specializations and segregation of border cells.

P elements and the determinants of hybrid dysgenesis have different dynamics of propagation in Drosophila melanogaster populations,26530414,10.1007/s10709-015-9872-z,"Intraspecific hybrid dysgenesis (HD) appears after some strains of D. melanogaster are crossed. The predominant idea is that the movement of transposable P elements causes HD. It is believed that P elements appeared in the D. melanogaster genome in the middle of the last century by horizontal transfer, simultaneously with the appearance of HD determinants. A subsequent simultaneous expansion of HD determinants and P elements occurred. We analyzed the current distribution of HD determinants in natural populations of D. melanogaster and found no evidence of their further spread. However, full-sized P elements were identified in the genomes of all analyzed natural D. melanogaster strains independent of their cytotypes. Thus, the expansion of P elements does not correlate with the expansion of HD determinants. We found that the ovaries of dysgenic females did not contain germ cells despite the equal number of primordial germ cells in early stages in dysgenic and non-dysgenic embryos. We propose that HD does not result from DNA damage caused by P element transposition, but it would be the disruption in the regulation of dysgenic ovarian formation that causes the dysgenic phenotypes.",2015,"Olesia M Ignatenko, Lyudmila P Zakharenko, Natalia V Dorogova, Svetlana A Fedorova"
Myoblast cytonemes mediate Wg signaling from the wing imaginal disc and Delta-Notch signaling to the air sac primordium,25951303,10.7554/eLife.06114,"The flight muscles, dorsal air sacs, wing blades, and thoracic cuticle of the Drosophila adult function in concert, and their progenitor cells develop together in the wing imaginal disc.

Here, we report that cytonemes also link flight muscle progenitors (myoblasts) to disc cells and to the ASP, enabling myoblasts to relay signaling between the disc and the ASP. Frizzled (Fz)-containing myoblast cytonemes take up Wingless (Wg) from the disc, and Delta (Dl)-containing myoblast cytonemes contribute to Notch activation in the ASP.

SJ diet enhanced survival of flies without affecting fecundity; male flies showed increased resistance to starvation. A higher number of flies emerged at F2 and F3 generation when fed the SJ diet than when fed the control CSY diet. SJ diet did not increase fly body weight and lipid percentage.

Intersex (ix) mutations of Drosophila melanogaster cause nonrandom cell death in genital disc and can induce tumours in genitals in response to decapentaplegic (dpp(disk)) mutations,26174668,10.1007/s12041-015-0503-3,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the intersex (ix) is a terminally positioned gene in somatic sex determination hierarchy and function with the female specific product of double sex (DSX(F)) to implement female sexual differentiation. The null phenotype of ix is to transform diplo-X individuals into intersexes while leaving haplo-X animals unaffected. This study on the effect of different intersex mutations on genital disc development provides the following major results: (i) similar range of a characteristic array of morphological structures (from almost double sex terminalia to extreme reduction of terminal appendages) was displayed by the terminalia of XX ix(1)/ix(1) , XX ix(2)/ix(2) and XX ix(5)/ix(5) individuals; (ii) an increased number of apoptotic cells were found to occur in a localized manner in mature third instar larval genital discs of ix individuals; (iii) ix mutations can induce high frequency of neoplastic tumours in genitals in the presence of decapentaplegic (dpp(disk)) mutations; and (iv) heteroallelic combinations of dpp(disk) mutations can also induce tumours in intersex genitals with variable expressivity. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that: (i) loss of function of ix causes massive cell death in both male and female genital primordia of genital discs, resulting phenotype mimicking in male and female characteristics in genitals; and (ii) at the discs, the apoptotic cells persist as 'undead' cells that can induce oncogenic transformation in the neighbouring disc cells when dpp signalling is blocked or reduced by dpp(disk) mutations.",2015,"R N Chatterjee, P Chatterjee, S Kuthe, M Acharyya-Ari, R Chatterjee, R N Chatterjee, P Chatterjee, S Kuthe, M Acharyya-Ari, R Chatterjee"

Novel genetic capacitors and potentiators for the natural genetic variation of sensory bristles and their trait specificity in Drosophila melanogaster,26441383,10.1111/mec.13407,"Cryptic genetic variation (CGV) is defined as the genetic variation that has little effect on phenotypic variation under a normal condition, but contributes to heritable variation under environmental or genetic perturbations. Genetic buffering systems that suppress the expression of CGV and store it in a population are called genetic capacitors, and the opposite systems are called genetic potentiators. One of the best-known candidates for a genetic capacitor and potentiator is the molecular chaperone protein, HSP90, and one of its characteristics is that it affects the genetic variation in various morphological traits. However, it remains unclear whether the wide-ranging effects of HSP90 on a broad range of traits are a general feature of genetic capacitors and potentiators. In the current study, I searched for novel genetic capacitors and potentiators for quantitative bristle traits of Drosophila melanogaster and then investigated the trait specificity of their genetic buffering effect. Three bristle traits of D. melanogaster were used as the target traits, and the genomic regions with genetic buffering effects were screened using the 61 genomic deficiencies examined previously for genetic buffering effects in wing shape. As a result, four and six deficiencies with significant effects on increasing and decreasing the broad-sense heritability of the bristle traits were identified, respectively. Of the 18 deficiencies with significant effects detected in the current study and/or by the previous study, 14 showed trait-specific effects, and four affected the genetic buffering of both bristle traits and wing shape. This suggests that most genetic capacitors and potentiators exert trait-specific effects, but that general capacitors and potentiators with effects on multiple traits also exist.",2015,"Kazuo H Takahashi, Kazuo H Takahashi"
The Trojan Female Technique for pest control: a candidate mitochondrial mutation confers low male fertility across diverse nuclear backgrounds in Drosophila melanogaster,26495040,10.1111/eva.12297,"Pest species represent a major ongoing threat to global biodiversity. Effective management approaches are required that regulate pest numbers, while minimizing collateral damage to nontarget species. The Trojan Female Technique (TFT) was recently proposed as a prospective approach to biological pest control. The TFT draws on the evolutionary hypothesis that maternally inherited mitochondrial genomes are prone to the accumulation of male, but not female, harming mutations. These mutations could be harnessed to provide trans-generational fertility-based control of pest species. A candidate TFT mutation was recently described in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which confers male-only sterility in the specific isogenic nuclear background in which it is maintained. However, applicability of the TFT relies on mitochondrial mutations whose male-sterilizing effects are general across nuclear genomic contexts. We test this assumption, expressing the candidate TFT-mutation bearing haplotype alongside a range of nuclear backgrounds and comparing its fertility in males, relative to that of control haplotypes.

Enhancer modularity and the evolution of new traits,26925592,10.1080/19336934.2016.1151129,"Animals have modular cis-regulatory regions in their genomes, and expression of a single gene is often regulated by multiple enhancers residing in such a region. In the laboratory, and also in natural populations, loss of an enhancer can result in a loss of gene expression. Although only a few examples have been well characterized to date, some studies have suggested that an evolutionary gain of a new enhancer function can establish a new gene expression domain. Our recent study showed that Drosophila guttifera has more enhancers and additional expression domains of the wingless gene during the pupal stage, compared to D. melanogaster, and that these new features appear to have evolved in the ancestral lineage leading to D. guttifera. (1) Gain of a new expression domain of a developmental regulatory gene (toolkit gene), such as wingless, can cause co-option of the expression of its downstream genes to the new domain, resulting in duplication of a preexisting structure at this new body position. Recently, with the advancement of evo-devo studies, we have learned that the developmental regulatory systems are strikingly similar across various animal taxa, in spite of the great diversity of the animals' morphology. Even behind ""new"" traits, co-options of essential developmental genes from known systems are very common. We previously provided concrete evidence of gains of enhancer activities of a developmental regulatory gene underlying gains of new traits. (1) Broad occurrence of this scenario is testable and should be validated in the future.",2015,"Shigeyuki Koshikawa, Shigeyuki Koshikawa"
Peptidoglycan recognition protein-triggered induction of Escherichia coli gene in Drosophila melanogaster,25577644,10.1093/jb/mvv002,"Interaction between the host and pathogen determines the fate of both organisms during the infectious state. The host is equipped with a battery of immune reactions, while the pathogen displays a variety of mechanisms to compromise host immunity. Although bacteria alter their pattern of gene expression in host organisms, studies to elucidate the mechanism behind this are only in their infancy. We here examined the possibility that host immune proteins directly participate in the change of gene expression in bacteria. Escherichia coli was treated with a mixture of the extracellular region of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC and the antimicrobial peptide attacin of Drosophila, and subjected to DNA microarray analysis for mRNA repertoire. We identified 133 annotated genes whose mRNA increased after the treatment, and at least four of them were induced in response to PGRP-LC. One such gene, lipoprotein-encoding nlpI, showed a transient increase of mRNA in adult flies depending on PGRP-LC but not PGRP-LE. NlpI-lacking E. coli had a lowered growth rate and/or viability in flies than the parental strain. These results suggest that a host immune receptor triggers a change of gene expression in bacteria simultaneously with their recognition and induction of immune responses.",2015,"Qingquan Kong, Yuji Nakai, Nanae Kuroda, Akiko Shiratsuchi, Kaz Nagaosa, Yoshinobu Nakanishi, Qingquan Kong, Yuji Nakai, Nanae Kuroda, Akiko Shiratsuchi, Kaz Nagaosa, Yoshinobu Nakanishi"
The Drosophila melanogaster Mutants apblot and apXasta Affect an Essential apterous Wing Enhancer,25840432,10.1534/g3.115.017707,"The selector gene apterous (ap) plays a key role during the development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing because it governs the establishment of the dorsal-ventral (D-V) compartment boundary. The D-V compartment boundary is known to serve as an important signaling center that is essential for the growth of the wing. The role of Ap and its downstream effectors have been studied extensively. However, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of ap during wing disc development. In this study, we present a first characterization of an essential wing-specific ap enhancer. First, we defined an 874-bp fragment about 10 kb upstream of the ap transcription start that faithfully recapitulates the expression pattern of ap in the wing imaginal disc. Analysis of deletions in the ap locus covering this element demonstrated that it is essential for proper regulation of ap and formation of the wing. Moreover, we showed that the mutations ap(blot) and ap(Xasta) directly affect the integrity of this enhancer, leading to characteristic wing phenotypes. Furthermore, we engineered an in situ rescue system at the endogenous ap gene locus, allowing us to investigate the role of enhancer fragments in their native environment. Using this system, we were able to demonstrate that the essential wing enhancer alone is not sufficient for normal wing development. The in situ rescue system will allow us to characterize the ap regulatory sequences in great detail at the endogenous locus.",2015,"Dimitri Bieli, Oguz Kanca, Daryl Gohl, Alexandru Denes, Paul Schedl, Markus Affolter, Martin MÃ¼ller, Dimitri Bieli, Oguz Kanca, Daryl Gohl, Alexandru Denes, Paul Schedl, Markus Affolter, Martin MÃ¼ller"
Modification of Male Courtship Motivation by Olfactory Habituation via the GABAA Receptor in Drosophila melanogaster,26252206,10.1371/journal.pone.0135186,"A male-specific component, 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) works as an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone in Drosophila melanogaster. The presence of cVA on a male suppresses the courtship motivation of other males and contributes to suppression of male-male homosexual courtship, while the absence of cVA on a female stimulates the sexual motivation of nearby males and enhances the male-female interaction. However, little is known how a male distinguishes the presence or absence of cVA on a target fly from either self-produced cVA or secondhand cVA from other males in the vicinity. In this study, we demonstrate that male flies have keen sensitivity to cVA; therefore, the presence of another male in the area reduces courtship toward a female. This reduced level of sexual motivation, however, could be overcome by pretest odor exposure via olfactory habituation to cVA. Real-time imaging of cVA-responsive sensory neurons using the neural activity sensor revealed that prolonged exposure to cVA decreased the levels of cVA responses in the primary olfactory center. Pharmacological and genetic screening revealed that signal transduction via GABAA receptors contributed to this olfactory habituation. We also found that the habituation experience increased the copulation success of wild-type males in a group. In contrast, transgenic males, in which GABA input in a small subset of local neurons was blocked by RNAi, failed to acquire the sexual advantage conferred by habituation. Thus, we illustrate a novel phenomenon in which olfactory habituation positively affects sexual capability in a competitive environment.",2015,"Shin-Ichiro Tachibana, Kazushige Touhara, Aki Ejima, Shin-Ichiro Tachibana, Kazushige Touhara, Aki Ejima"
Curcumin mitigates accelerated aging after irradiation in Drosophila by reducing oxidative stress,25815315,10.1155/2015/425380,"Curcumin, belonging to a class of natural phenol compounds, has been extensively studied due to its antioxidative, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antineurodegenerative effects. Recently, it has been shown to exert dual activities after irradiation, radioprotection, and radiosensitization. Here, we investigated the protective effect of curcumin against radiation damage using D. melanogaster. Pretreatment with curcumin (100 Î¼M) recovered the shortened lifespan caused by irradiation and increased eclosion rate. Flies subjected to high-dose irradiation showed a mutant phenotype of outstretched wings, whereas curcumin pretreatment reduced incidence of the mutant phenotype. Protein carbonylation and formation of Î³H2Ax foci both increased following high-dose irradiation most likely due to generation of reactive oxygen species. Curcumin pretreatment reduced the amount of protein carbonylation as well as formation of Î³H2Ax foci. Therefore, we suggest that curcumin acts as an oxidative stress reducer as well as an effective protective agent against radiation damage.",2015,"Ki Moon Seong, Mira Yu, Kyu-Sun Lee, Sunhoo Park, Young Woo Jin, Kyung-Jin Min, Ki Moon Seong, Mira Yu, Kyu-Sun Lee, Sunhoo Park, Young Woo Jin, Kyung-Jin Min"
Drosophila sessile hemocyte clusters are true hematopoietic tissues that regulate larval blood cell differentiation,25650737,10.7554/eLife.06166,"Virtually all species of coelomate animals contain blood cells that display a division of labor necessary for homeostasis. This functional partition depends upon the balance between proliferation and differentiation mostly accomplished in the hematopoietic organs. In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupariation. Yet, throughout larval development, both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasmatocytes can proliferate but it is not known if crystal cell numbers increase by self-renewal or by de novo differentiation. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.",2015,"Alexandre B LeitÃ£o, ?lio Sucena, Alexandre B LeitÃ£o, ?lio Sucena"
Sleep in Populations of Drosophila Melanogaster,26465005,10.1523/ENEURO.0071-15.2015,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a diurnal insect active during the day with consolidated sleep at night. Social interactions between pairs of flies have been shown to affect locomotor activity patterns, but effects on locomotion and sleep patterns have not been assessed for larger populations. Here, we use a commercially available locomotor activity monitor (LAM25H) system to record and analyze sleep behavior. Surprisingly, we find that same-sex populations of flies synchronize their sleep/wake activity, resulting in a population sleep pattern, which is similar but not identical to that of isolated individuals. Like individual flies, groups of flies show circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep, as well as sexual dimorphism in sleep pattern and sensitivity to starvation and a known sleep-disrupting mutation (amnesiac). Populations of flies, however, exhibit distinct sleep characteristics from individuals. Differences in sleep appear to be due to olfaction-dependent social interactions and change with population size and sex ratio. These data support the idea that it is possible to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of population behaviors on sleep by directly looking at a large number of animals in laboratory conditions.",2015,"Chang Liu, Paula R Haynes, Nathan C Donelson, Shani Aharon, Leslie C Griffith, Chang Liu, Paula R Haynes, Nathan C Donelson, Shani Aharon, Leslie C Griffith"

Analysis of these data sets provided foundational insights into genome, epigenome, and transcriptome structure and the evolutionary turnover of regulatory pathways. These studies facilitated a comparative analysis with similar data types produced by the ENCODE Consortium for human cells. Genome organization differs drastically in these distant species, and yet quantitative relationships among chromatin state, transcription, and cotranscriptional RNA processing are deeply conserved.

Potency of transgenic effectors for neurogenetic manipulation in Drosophila larvae,25359929,10.1534/genetics.114.172023,"Genetic manipulations of neuronal activity are a cornerstone of studies aimed to identify the functional impact of defined neurons for animal behavior. With its small nervous system, rapid life cycle, and genetic amenability, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster provides an attractive model system to study neuronal circuit function. In the past two decades, a large repertoire of elegant genetic tools has been developed to manipulate and study neural circuits in the fruit fly. Current techniques allow genetic ablation, constitutive silencing, or hyperactivation of neuronal activity and also include conditional thermogenetic or optogenetic activation or inhibition. As for all genetic techniques, the choice of the proper transgenic tool is essential for behavioral studies. Potency and impact of effectors may vary in distinct neuron types or distinct types of behavior. We here systematically test genetic effectors for their potency to alter the behavior of Drosophila larvae, using two distinct behavioral paradigms: general locomotor activity and directed, visually guided navigation. Our results show largely similar but not equal effects with different effector lines in both assays. Interestingly, differences in the magnitude of induced behavioral alterations between different effector lines remain largely consistent between the two behavioral assays.

Complete Dosage Compensation in Anopheles stephensi and the Evolution of Sex-Biased Genes in Mosquitoes,26078263,10.1093/gbe/evv115,"Complete dosage compensation refers to hyperexpression of the entire X or Z chromosome in organisms with heterogametic sex chromosomes (XY male or ZW female) in order to compensate for having only one copy of the X or Z chromosome. Recent analyses suggest that complete dosage compensation, as in Drosophila melanogaster, may not be the norm. There has been no systematic study focusing on dosage compensation in mosquitoes. However, analysis of dosage compensation in Anopheles mosquitoes provides opportunities for evolutionary insights, as the X chromosome of Anopheles and that of its Dipteran relative, D. melanogaster formed independently from the same ancestral chromosome. Furthermore, Culicinae mosquitoes, including the Aedes genus, have homomorphic sex-determining chromosomes, negating the need for dosage compensation. Thus, Culicinae genes provide a rare phylogenetic context to investigate dosage compensation in Anopheles mosquitoes. Here, we performed RNA-seq analysis of male and female samples of the Asian malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi and the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. Autosomal and X-linked genes in An. stephensi showed very similar levels of expression in both males and females, indicating complete dosage compensation. The uniformity of average expression levels of autosomal and X-linked genes remained when An. stephensi gene expression was normalized by that of their Ae. aegypti orthologs, strengthening the finding of complete dosage compensation in Anopheles. In addition, we comparatively analyzed the differentially expressed genes between adult males and adult females in both species, investigated sex-biased gene chromosomal distribution patterns in An. stephensi and provided three examples where gene duplications may have enabled the acquisition of sex-specific expression during mosquito evolution.",2015,"Xiaofang Jiang, James K Biedler, Yumin Qi, Andrew Brantley Hall, Zhijian Tu, Xiaofang Jiang, James K Biedler, Yumin Qi, Andrew Brantley Hall, Zhijian Tu"
Identified Serotonin-Releasing Neurons Induce Behavioral Quiescence and Suppress Mating in Drosophila,26377467,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1638-15.2015,"Animals show different levels of activity that are reflected in sensory responsiveness and endogenously generated behaviors. Biogenic amines have been determined to be causal factors for these states of arousal. It is well established that, in Drosophila, dopamine and octopamine promote increased arousal. However, little is known about factors that regulate arousal negatively and induce states of quiescence. Moreover, it remains unclear whether global, diffuse modulatory systems comprehensively affecting brain activity determine general states of arousal. Alternatively, individual aminergic neurons might selectively modulate the animals' activity in a distinct behavioral context. Here, we show that artificially activating large populations of serotonin-releasing neurons induces behavioral quiescence and inhibits feeding and mating. We systematically narrowed down a role of serotonin in inhibiting endogenously generated locomotor activity to neurons located in the posterior medial protocerebrum. We identified neurons of this cell cluster that suppress mating, but not feeding behavior. These results suggest that serotonin does not uniformly act as global, negative modulator of general arousal. Rather, distinct serotoninergic neurons can act as inhibitory modulators of specific behaviors.
    

    
  


        Significance statement:
      
    

    
      An animal's responsiveness to external stimuli and its various types of endogenously generated, motivated behavior are highly dynamic and change between states of high activity and states of low activity. It remains unclear whether these states are mediated by unitary modulatory systems globally affecting brain activity, or whether distinct neurons modulate specific neuronal circuits underlying particular types of behavior. Using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, we find that activating large proportions of serotonin-releasing neurons induces behavioral quiescence. Moreover, distinct serotonin-releasing neurons that we genetically isolated and identified negatively affect aspects of mating behavior, but not food uptake. This demonstrates that individual serotoninergic neurons can modulate distinct types of behavior selectively.",2015,"Atefeh Pooryasin, AndrÃ© Fiala, Atefeh Pooryasin, AndrÃ© Fiala"
Compensatory growth in novel Drosophila Akt1 mutants,25889856,10.1186/s13104-015-1032-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      Organisms, tissues and cells are genetically programmed to grow to a specific largely pre-set size and shape within the appropriate developmental timing. In the event of mutation, cell death, or tissue damage, the remaining cells may increase their rate of growth to compensate and generate an intact, potentially smaller, tissue or organism in order to achieve the desired size. A delay in the developmental timing could aid in this process. The insulin receptor signalling pathway with its central component, the Akt1 kinase, and endpoint regulator, the transcription factor foxo, plays a significant role in the control of growth. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model organism with a well-studied life cycle and a consistently developing compound eye that can undergo analysis to compare changes in the properties of adult ommatidia as an indicator of growth.
    

    
  


        Findings:
      
    

    
      Imprecise excision of a PZ P-element inserted in the upstream region of Akt1 generated several novel hypomorphic alleles with internally deleted regions of the Pelement. These mutations lead to small, viable Drosophila that present with delays in development. Suppression of this phenotype by the directed expression of Akt1 (+) indicates that the phenotypes observed are Akt1 dependent. Somatic clones of the eyes, consisting of homozygous tissue in otherwise heterozygous organisms that develop within a standard timeframe, signify that more severe phenotypes are masked by an extension in the time of development of homozygous mutants. Generation of Drosophila having the hypomorphic Akt1 alleles and a null allele of the downstream target foxo result in a phenotype very similar to that of the foxo mutant and do not resemble the Akt1 mutants.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The developmental delay of these novel Akt1 hypomorphs results in a latent phenotype uncovered by generation of somatic clones. The compensatory growth occurring during the extended time of development appears to be implemented through alteration of foxo activity. Production of clones is an effective and informative way to observe the effects of mutations that result in small, viable, developmentally delayed flies.",2015,"Jennifer D Slade, Brian E Staveley, Jennifer D Slade, Brian E Staveley"

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been proven tremendously valuable as a model organism, enabling many major discoveries in neuroscientific disease research. The plethora of genetic tools available in Drosophila allows for exquisite targeted manipulation of the genome. Due to its relatively short lifespan, complex questions of brain function can be addressed more rapidly than in other model organisms, such as the mouse.

A Subset of Serotonergic Neurons Evokes Hunger in Adult Drosophila,26344091,10.1016/j.cub.2015.08.005,"Hunger is a complex motivational state that drives multiple behaviors. The sensation of hunger is caused by an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. One immediate response to hunger is increased food consumption. Hunger also modulates behaviors related to food seeking such as increased locomotion and enhanced sensory sensitivity in both insects and vertebrates. In addition, hunger can promote the expression of food-associated memory. Although progress is being made, how hunger is represented in the brain and how it coordinates these behavioral responses is not fully understood in any system. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to identify neurons encoding hunger. We found a small group of neurons that, when activated, induced a fed fly to eat as though it were starved, suggesting that these neurons are downstream of the metabolic regulation of hunger. Artificially activating these neurons also promotes appetitive memory performance in sated flies, indicating that these neurons are not simply feeding command neurons but likely play a more general role in encoding hunger. We determined that the neurons relevant for the feeding effect are serotonergic and project broadly within the brain, suggesting a possible mechanism for how various responses to hunger are coordinated. These findings extend our understanding of the neural circuitry that drives feeding and enable future exploration of how state influences neural activity within this circuit.",2015,"Stephanie D Albin, Karla R Kaun, Jon-Michael Knapp, Phuong Chung, Ulrike Heberlein, Julie H Simpson, Stephanie D Albin, Karla R Kaun, Jon-Michael Knapp, Phuong Chung, Ulrike Heberlein, Julie H Simpson"
Drosophila Avoids Parasitoids by Sensing Their Semiochemicals via a Dedicated Olfactory Circuit,26674493,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002318,"Detecting danger is one of the foremost tasks for a neural system. Larval parasitoids constitute clear danger to Drosophila, as up to 80% of fly larvae become parasitized in nature. We show that Drosophila melanogaster larvae and adults avoid sites smelling of the main parasitoid enemies, Leptopilina wasps. This avoidance is mediated via a highly specific olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) type. While the larval OSN expresses the olfactory receptor Or49a and is tuned to the Leptopilina odor iridomyrmecin, the adult expresses both Or49a and Or85f and in addition detects the wasp odors actinidine and nepetalactol. The information is transferred via projection neurons to a specific part of the lateral horn known to be involved in mediating avoidance. Drosophila has thus developed a dedicated circuit to detect a life-threatening enemy based on the smell of its semiochemicals.

"The Discovery, Distribution, and Evolution of Viruses Associated with Drosophila melanogaster",26172158,10.1371/journal.pbio.1002210,"Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable invertebrate model for viral infection and antiviral immunity, and is a focus for studies of insect-virus coevolution. Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify more than 20 previously undetected RNA viruses and a DNA virus associated with wild D. melanogaster. These viruses not only include distant relatives of known insect pathogens but also novel groups of insect-infecting viruses. By sequencing virus-derived small RNAs, we show that the viruses represent active infections of Drosophila. We find that the RNA viruses differ in the number and properties of their small RNAs, and we detect both siRNAs and a novel miRNA from the DNA virus. Analysis of small RNAs also allows us to identify putative viral sequences that lack detectable sequence similarity to known viruses. By surveying >2,000 individually collected wild adult Drosophila we show that more than 30% of D. melanogaster carry a detectable virus, and more than 6% carry multiple viruses. However, despite a high prevalence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont--which is known to be protective against virus infections in Drosophila--we were unable to detect any relationship between the presence of Wolbachia and the presence of any virus. Using publicly available RNA-seq datasets, we show that the community of viruses in Drosophila laboratories is very different from that seen in the wild, but that some of the newly discovered viruses are nevertheless widespread in laboratory lines and are ubiquitous in cell culture. By sequencing viruses from individual wild-collected flies we show that some viruses are shared between D. melanogaster and D. simulans.

A genetic screen and transcript profiling reveal a shared regulatory program for Drosophila linker histone H1 and chromatin remodeler CHD1,25628309,10.1534/g3.115.016709,"Chromatin structure and activity can be modified through ATP-dependent repositioning of nucleosomes and posttranslational modifications of core histone tails within nucleosome core particles and by deposition of linker histones into the oligonucleosome fiber. The linker histone H1 is essential in metazoans. It has a profound effect on organization of chromatin into higher-order structures and on recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes to chromatin. Here, we describe a genetic screen for modifiers of the lethal phenotype caused by depletion of H1 in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify 41 mis-expression alleles that enhance and 20 that suppress the effect of His1 depletion in vivo. Most of them are important for chromosome organization, transcriptional regulation, and cell signaling. Specifically, the reduced viability of H1-depleted animals is strongly suppressed by ubiquitous mis-expression of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme CHD1. Comparison of transcript profiles in H1-depleted and Chd1 null mutant larvae revealed that H1 and CHD1 have common transcriptional regulatory programs in vivo. H1 and CHD1 share roles in repression of numerous developmentally regulated and extracellular stimulus-responsive transcripts, including immunity-related and stress response-related genes.

A Behavioral Assay for Mechanosensation of MARCM-based Clones in Drosophila melanogaster,26780205,10.3791/53537,"Because of the structural and functional homology to the hair cells of the mammalian inner ear, the neurons that innervate the Drosophila external sense organs provide an excellent model system for the study of mechanosensation. This protocol describes a simple touch behavior in fruit flies which can be used to identify mutations that interfere with mechanosensation. The tactile stimulation of a macrochaete bristle on the thorax of flies elicits a grooming reflex from either the first or third leg. Mutations that interfere with mechanotransduction (such as NOMPC), or with other aspects of the reflex arc, can inhibit the grooming response. A traditional screen of adult behaviors would have missed mutants that have essential roles during development. Instead, this protocol combines the touch screen with mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) to allow for only limited regions of homozygous mutant cells to be generated and marked by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP).

We screened D. melanogaster orthologs of a previously reported mammalian autophagy protein-protein interaction network, identifying several proteins required for autophagosome formation in muscle cells, including orthologs of the Rab regulators RabGap1 and Rab3Gap1. The screen also highlighted the critical roles of the proteasome and glycogen metabolism in regulating autophagy. Specifically, sustained proteasome inhibition inhibited autophagosome formation both in primary culture and larval skeletal muscle, even though autophagy normally acts to suppress ubiquitin aggregate formation in these tissues. In addition, analyses of glycogen metabolic genes in both primary cultured and larval muscles indicated that glycogen storage enhances the autophagic response to starvation, an important insight given the link between glycogen storage disorders, autophagy, and muscle function.",2015,"Jonathan Zirin, Joppe Nieuwenhuis, Anastasia Samsonova, Rong Tao, Norbert Perrimon, Jonathan Zirin, Joppe Nieuwenhuis, Anastasia Samsonova, Rong Tao, Norbert Perrimon"
Trithorax regulates systemic signaling during Drosophila imaginal disc regeneration,26487779,10.1242/dev.122564,"Although tissue regeneration has been studied in a variety of organisms, from Hydra to humans, many of the genes that regulate the ability of each animal to regenerate remain unknown. The larval imaginal discs of the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster have complex patterning, well-characterized development and a high regenerative capacity, and are thus an excellent model system for studying mechanisms that regulate regeneration. To identify genes that are important for wound healing and tissue repair, we have carried out a genetic screen for mutations that impair regeneration in the wing imaginal disc. Through this screen we identified the chromatin-modification gene trithorax as a key regeneration gene. Here we show that animals heterozygous for trithorax are unable to maintain activation of a developmental checkpoint that allows regeneration to occur. This defect is likely to be caused by abnormally high expression of puckered, a negative regulator of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, at the wound site. Insufficient JNK signaling leads to insufficient expression of an insulin-like peptide, dILP8, which is required for the developmental checkpoint. Thus, trithorax regulates regeneration signaling and capacity.",2015,"Andrea Skinner, Sumbul Jawed Khan, Rachel K Smith-Bolton, Andrea Skinner, Sumbul Jawed Khan, Rachel K Smith-Bolton"
Elucidating the molecular architecture of adaptation via evolve and resequence experiments,26347030,10.1038/nrg3937,"Evolve and resequence (E&R) experiments use experimental evolution to adapt populations to a novel environment, then next-generation sequencing to analyse genetic changes. They enable molecular evolution to be monitored in real time on a genome-wide scale. Here, we review the field of E&R experiments across diverse systems, ranging from simple non-living RNA to bacteria, yeast and the complex multicellular organism Drosophila melanogaster. We explore how different evolutionary outcomes in these systems are largely consistent with common population genetics principles. Differences in outcomes across systems are largely explained by different starting population sizes, levels of pre-existing genetic variation, recombination rates and adaptive landscapes.

Class I myosins have overlapping and specialized functions in left-right asymmetric development in Drosophila,25659376,10.1534/genetics.115.174698,"The class I myosin genes are conserved in diverse organisms, and their gene products are involved in actin dynamics, endocytosis, and signal transduction. Drosophila melanogaster has three class I myosin genes, Myosin 31DF (Myo31DF), Myosin 61F (Myo61F), and Myosin 95E (Myo95E). Myo31DF, Myo61F, and Myo95E belong to the Myosin ID, Myosin IC, and Myosin IB families, respectively. Previous loss-of-function analyses of Myo31DF and Myo61F revealed important roles in left-right (LR) asymmetric development and enterocyte maintenance, respectively. However, it was difficult to elucidate their roles in vivo, because of potential redundant activities. Here we generated class I myosin double and triple mutants to address this issue. We found that the triple mutant was viable and fertile, indicating that all three class I myosins were dispensable for survival. A loss-of-function analysis revealed further that Myo31DF and Myo61F, but not Myo95E, had redundant functions in promoting the dextral LR asymmetric development of the male genitalia. Myo61F overexpression is known to antagonize the dextral activity of Myo31DF in various Drosophila organs. Thus, the LR-reversing activity of overexpressed Myo61F may not reflect its physiological function. The endogenous activity of Myo61F in promoting dextral LR asymmetric development was observed in the male genitalia, but not the embryonic gut, another LR asymmetric organ. Thus, Myo61F and Myo31DF, but not Myo95E, play tissue-specific, redundant roles in LR asymmetric development.

These elements are related to conserved regulatory features of three of the genes, including tissue- and temporal regulation. In the fourth, gene s15, significant alterations in the 5' flanking region may be responsible for its changed temporal regulation in C. capitata. One long intergenic sequence, located in the distal 5' flanking region of gene s18, is homologous to ACE3, a major amplification control element and contains an 80-bp A/T-rich sequence, known to stimulate strong binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in D. melanogaster.

Grasshopper hunchback expression reveals conserved and novel aspects of axis formation and segmentation,11566852,,"While the expression patterns of segment polarity genes such as engrailed have been shown to be similar in Drosophila melanogaster and Schistocerca americana (grasshopper), the expression patterns of pair-rule genes such as even-skipped are not conserved between these species. This might suggest that the factors upstream of pair-rule gene expression are not conserved across insect species. We find that, despite this, many aspects of the expression of the Drosophila gap gene hunchback are shared with its orthologs in the grasshoppers S. americana and L. migratoria. We have analyzed both mRNA and protein expression during development, and find that the grasshopper hunchback orthologs appear to have a conserved role in early axial patterning of the germ anlagen and in the specification of gnathal and thoracic primordia. In addition, distinct stepped expression levels of hunchback in the gnathal/thoracic domains suggest that grasshopper hunchback may act in a concentration-dependent fashion (as in Drosophila), although morphogenetic activity is not set up by diffusion to form a smooth gradient. Axial patterning functions appear to be performed entirely by zygotic hunchback, a fundamental difference from Drosophila in which maternal and zygotic hunchback play redundant roles. In grasshoppers, maternal hunchback activity is provided uniformly to the embryo as protein and, we suggest, serves a distinct role in distinguishing embryonic from extra-embryonic cells along the anteroposterior axis from the outset of development - a distinction made in Drosophila along the dorsoventral axis later in development. Later hunchback expression in the abdominal segments is conserved, as are patterns in the nervous system, and in both Drosophila and grasshopper, hunchback is expressed in a subset of extra-embryonic cells. Thus, while the expected domains of hunchback expression are conserved in Schistocerca, we have found surprising and fundamental differences in axial patterning, and have identified a previously unreported domain of expression in Drosophila that suggests conservation of a function in extra-embryonic patterning.",2001,"N H Patel, D C Hayward, S Lall, N R Pirkl, D DiPietro, E E Ball, N H Patel, D C Hayward, S Lall, N R Pirkl, D DiPietro, E E Ball"
Interactions of tryptamine derivatives with serotonin transporter species variants implicate transmembrane domain I in substrate recognition,11179447,10.1124/mol.59.3.514,"The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter (SERT) is responsible for the inactivation of synaptic 5-HT and is also a target for multiple psychostimulants. Despite the critical role of SERT in 5-HT inactivation and psychostimulant response, many aspects of the transporter's recognition of ligands are poorly defined. We took advantage of sequence divergence of SERT species variants to identify structural determinants of substrate recognition. Tryptamine derivatives with substitutions at the 4 and 7 positions on the phenyl ring, the indole nitrogen, and the beta position show up to 40-fold potency differences for inhibiting [(3)H]5-HT transport in cells transfected with either human or Drosophila melanogaster SERT cDNAs. Species selectivities of these derivatives were largely recapitulated in antagonist binding. Human/D. melanogaster SERT chimera studies implicated the first two SERT transmembrane domains (TMDs) in the potency of the indole nitrogen-substituted compounds N-isopropyltryptamine (NIT), 5-methoxy-N-isopropyltryptamine (5-MNIT), and the 7-substituted compound 7-benzyloxytryptamine (7BT). Potency differences of analogs with substitutions at the 4 and beta positions are influenced by sequences distal to this region. Within TMD I-II, species-scanning mutagenesis implicated a single residue (Y95 in human SERT, F90 in D. melanogaster SERT) in the recognition of NIT, 5-MNIT, and 7BT. Remarkably, this is the same site we established previously in species-specific recognition of the antagonists citalopram and mazindol. These findings support a critical role for TMD I residues in defining shared aspects of SERT substrate and antagonist recognition.",2001,"E M Adkins, E L Barker, R D Blakely, E M Adkins, E L Barker, R D Blakely"
Drosophila euchromatic LTR retrotransposons are much younger than the host species in which they reside,11544196,10.1101/gr.164201,"The recent release of the complete euchromatic genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster offers a unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary history of transposable elements (TEs) within the genome of a higher eukaryote. In this report, we describe the annotation and phylogenetic comparison of 178 full-length long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons from the sequenced component of the D. melanogaster genome. We report the characterization of 17 LTR retrotransposon families described previously and five newly discovered element families. Phylogenetically, these families can be divided into three distinct lineages that consist of members from the canonical Copia and Gypsy groups as well as a newly discovered third group containing BEL, mazi, and roo elements. Each family consists of members with average pairwise identities > or =99% at the nucleotide level, indicating they may be the products of recent transposition events. Consistent with the recent transposition hypothesis, we found that 70% (125/178) of the elements (across all families) have identical intra-element LTRs. Using the synonymous substitution rate that has been calculated previously for Drosophila (.016 substitutions per site per million years) and the intra-element LTR divergence calculated here, the average age of the remaining 30% (53/178) of the elements was found to be 137,000 +/-89,000 yr.

Mushroom bodies and post-mating behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster females,11895142,10.3109/01677060109066198,"After mating, Drosophila melanogaster females lay substantially more eggs and mate rarely. Central to these changes is Sex peptide (SP), a male peptide transferred into the female during copulation. Injected into virgins, SP induces the same post mating response as observed after mating. In this study we investigated the role of the mushroom body (MB) in the SP response system. The SP response of females with either chemically ablated or mutant MBs was analyzed. After injection of SP, females with chemically ablated MBs reduce their receptivity and increase their ovulation and oviposition to the level of females with intact MBs. Virgin females with ablated MBs, however, show a constitutively elevated oviposition rate. Hence in untreated females, MBs are not implicated in the SP-induced reduction of receptivity and increase of ovulation. However, they depress the oviposition rate of virgins. Thus, SP has two functions for oviposition: it de-represses the MB-dependent block on the egg laying activity of virgins and additionally stimulates oviposition. SP-injected mushroom body miniature (mbm) females lay fewer eggs, ovulate less frequently, and mate more often than wild-type females. A model of the putative role of MBs and the gene product of mbm in SP-induced oviposition is presented.",2001,"I Fleischmann, B Cotton, Y Choffat, M Spengler, E Kubli, I Fleischmann, B Cotton, Y Choffat, M Spengler, E Kubli"
Chromosome elasticity and mitotic polar ejection force measured in living Drosophila embryos by four-dimensional microscopy-based motion analysis,11369201,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00180-4,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mitosis involves the interaction of many different components, including chromatin, microtubules, and motor proteins. Dissecting the mechanics of mitosis requires methods of studying not just each component in isolation, but also the entire ensemble of components in its full complexity in genetically tractable model organisms.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have developed a mathematical framework for analyzing motion in four-dimensional microscopy data sets that allows us to measure elasticity, viscosity, and forces by tracking the conformational movements of mitotic chromosomes. We have used this approach to measure, for the first time, the basic biophysical parameters of mitosis in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We found that Drosophila embryo chromosomes are significantly less rigid than the much larger chromosomes of vertebrates. Anaphase kinetochore force and nucleoplasmic viscosity were comparable with previous estimates in other species. Motion analysis also allowed us to measure the magnitude of the polar ejection force exerted on chromosome arms during metaphase by individual microtubules. We find the magnitude of this force to be approximately 1 pN, a number consistent with force generation either by collision of growing microtubules with chromosomes or by single kinesin motors.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

FIGQY phosphorylation defines discrete populations of L1 cell adhesion molecules at sites of cell-cell contact and in migrating neurons,11719549,,"Phosphorylation of neurofascin, a member of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules (L1 CAMs), at the conserved FIGQY-tyrosine abolishes the ankyrin-neurofascin interaction. This study provides the first evidence, in Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrates, for the physiological occurrence of FIGQY phosphorylation in L1 family members. FIGQY tyrosine phosphorylation is localized at specialized cell junctions, including paranodes of sciatic nerve, neuromuscular junctions of adult rats and Drosophila embryos, epidermal muscle attachment sites of Drosophila, and adherens junctions of developing epithelial cells of rat and Drosophila. In addition, FIGQY-phosphorylated L1 CAMs are abundantly expressed in regions of neuronal migration and axon extension, including the embryonic cortex, the neonatal cerebellum and the rostral migratory stream, a region of continued neurogenesis and migration throughout adulthood in the rat. Based on our results, physiological FIGQY-tyrosine phosphorylation of the L1 family likely regulates adhesion molecule-ankyrin interactions establishing ankyrin-free and ankyrin-containing microdomains and participates in an ankyrin-independent intracellular signaling pathway at specialized sites of intercellular contact in epithelial and nervous tissue.",2001,"S M Jenkins, K Kizhatil, N R Kramarcy, A Sen, R Sealock, V Bennett, S M Jenkins, K Kizhatil, N R Kramarcy, A Sen, R Sealock, V Bennett"
The nucleotide changes governing cuticular hydrocarbon variation and their evolution in Drosophila melanogaster,11259658,10.1073/pnas.061465098,"The cuticular hydrocarbon (CH) pheromones in Drosophila melanogaster exhibit strong geographic variation.

We then carried out a hierarchical search for diagnostic nucleotide sites starting with four lines, and increasing to 24 and 43 lines from a worldwide collection. Within the 13-kb region, only one variable site shows a complete concordance with the CH phenotype.

Interactions of the Tribolium Sex combs reduced and proboscipedia orthologs in embryonic labial development,11779803,,"The role of Hox genes in the development of insect gnathal appendages has been examined in three insects: the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster; the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus; and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. In each of these organisms, the identity of the labium depends on the homeotic genes Sex combs reduced (Scr) and proboscipedia (pb). Loss of pb function in each of the three insects results in homeotic transformation of the labial appendages to legs. In contrast, loss of Scr function yields a different transformation in each species. Interestingly, mutations in Cephalothorax (Cx), the Tribolium ortholog of Scr, transform the labial appendages to antennae, a result seen in the other insects only when both pb and Scr are removed. We show here that the Tribolium labial appendages also develop as antennae in double mutants. Further, we demonstrate that expression of the Tribolium proboscipedia ortholog maxillopedia (mxp) is greatly reduced or absent in the labium of Cx mutant larvae. Thus, in the wild-type labial segment, Cx function is required (directly or indirectly) for mxp transcription. A similar interaction between Scr and pb during Drosophila embryogenesis has been described recently.

Heritabilities and genetic and phenotypic variances were generally higher in the isofemale line design than in the offspring--parent regression design under both standard and poor nutritional conditions. For each trait, the response of heritability to stress was similar in both designs: wing length exhibited lower heritability under poor nutrition, whereas heritabilities of thorax length and sternopleural bristle number did not differ between nutritional regimes. Statistically significant differences in the genetic variances and the environmental variances between stressful and nonstressful environments were recorded only in isofemale lines: the genetic variance of thorax length and the environmental variances of thorax length and wing length were higher under poor nutrition.

Evolution of the integrin alpha and beta protein families,11139295,10.1007/s002390010134,"A phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate and invertebrate alpha integrins supported the hypothesis that two major families of vertebrate alpha integrins originated prior to the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.

In contrast, a third family (including alpha PS3) has duplicated in Drosophila but is absent from vertebrates. Vertebrate alpha PS1 and alpha PS2 family members are found on human chromosomes 2, 12, and 17. Linkage of these family members may have been conserved since prior to the origin of vertebrates, and the two genes duplicated simultaneously.

Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)/origin recognition complex (ORC) protein is associated with HP1 and ORC and functions in heterochromatin-induced silencing,11408576,10.1091/mbc.12.6.1671,"Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a conserved component of the highly compact chromatin of higher eukaryotic centromeres and telomeres. Cytogenetic experiments in Drosophila have shown that HP1 localization into this chromatin is perturbed in mutants for the origin recognition complex (ORC) 2 subunit. ORC has a multisubunit DNA-binding activity that binds origins of DNA replication where it is required for origin firing. The DNA-binding activity of ORC is also used in the recruitment of the Sir1 protein to silence nucleation sites flanking silent copies of the mating-type genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A fraction of HP1 in the maternally loaded cytoplasm of the early Drosophila embryo is associated with a multiprotein complex containing Drosophila melanogaster ORC subunits. This complex appears to be poised to function in heterochromatin assembly later in embryonic development. Here we report the identification of a novel component of this complex, the HP1/ORC-associated protein.

Differential distribution of simple sequence repeats in eukaryotic genome sequences,11420357,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003903,"Complete chromosome/genome sequences available from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed for the occurrence of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats. In all of the genomes studied, dinucleotide repeat stretches tended to be longer than other repeats. Additionally, tetranucleotide repeats in humans and trinucleotide repeats in Drosophila also seemed to be longer. Although the trends for different repeats are similar between different chromosomes within a genome, the density of repeats may vary between different chromosomes of the same species. The abundance or rarity of various di- and trinucleotide repeats in different genomes cannot be explained by nucleotide composition of a sequence or potential of repeated motifs to form alternative DNA structures. This suggests that in addition to nucleotide composition of repeat motifs, characteristic DNA replication/repair/recombination machinery might play an important role in the genesis of repeats. Moreover, analysis of complete genome coding DNA sequences of Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast indicated that expansions of codon repeats corresponding to small hydrophilic amino acids are tolerated more, while strong selection pressures probably eliminate codon repeats encoding hydrophobic and basic amino acids.

Elbrecht et al. (Insect Biochem. Mol.

"Adaptive evolution of Cid, a centromere-specific histone in Drosophila",11238413,,"Centromeric DNA is generally composed of large blocks of tandem satellite repeats that change rapidly due to loss of old arrays and expansion of new repeat classes. This extreme heterogeneity of centromeric DNA is difficult to reconcile with the conservation of the eukaryotic chromosome segregation machinery. Histone H3-like proteins, including Cid in Drosophila melanogaster, are a unique chromatin component of centromeres. In comparisons between closely related species of Drosophila, we find an excess of replacement changes that have been fixed since the separation of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, suggesting adaptive evolution. The last adaptive changes appear to have occurred recently, as evident from a reduction in polymorphism in the melanogaster lineage. Adaptive evolution has occurred both in the long N-terminal tail as well as in the histone fold of Cid. In the histone fold, the replacement changes have occurred in the region proposed to mediate binding to DNA. We propose that this rapid evolution of Cid is driven by a response to the changing satellite repeats at centromeres. Thus, centromeric H3-like proteins may act as adaptors between evolutionarily labile centromeric DNA and the conserved kinetochore machinery.",2001,"H S Malik, S Henikoff, H S Malik, S Henikoff"

In most of these invertebrate models, some aspects of the human diseases are reproduced. Although expression of all these proteins in transgenic mice has been instructive, the invertebrate models offer experimental advantages (e.g. forward genetic screens) that can potentially address some of the outstanding questions regarding the cellular processes underlying these diseases.

Computational Prediction of CRISPR/Cas9 Target Sites Reveals Potential Off-Target Risks in Human and Mouse,28643248,10.1007/978-1-4939-7128-2_4,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system is a prominent genome engineering technology. In the CRISPR/Cas system, the RNA-guided endonuclease Cas protein introduces a DNA double-stranded break at the genome position recognized by a guide RNA (gRNA) based on complementary base-pairing of about 20-nucleotides in length. The 8- or 12-mer gRNA sequence in the proximal region is especially important for target recognition, and the genes with sequence complementarity to such regions are often disrupted. To carry out target site-specific genome editing, we released the CRISPRdirect ( http://crispr.dbcls.jp /) website. This website allows us to select target site-specific gRNA sequences by performing exhaustive searches against entire genomic sequences. In this study, target site-specific gRNA sequences were designed for human, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. The calculation results revealed that at least five gRNA sequences, each of them having only one perfectly complementary site in the whole genome, could be designed for more than 95% of genes, regardless of the organism. Next, among those gRNAs, we selected gRNAs that did not have any other complementary site to the unique 12-mer proximal sequences to avoid possible off-target effects. This computational prediction revealed that target site-specific gRNAs are selectable for the majority of genes in D. melanogaster and C. elegans.

The Role of Histone Deacetylase 6 in Synaptic Plasticity and Memory,28178513,10.1016/j.celrep.2017.01.028,"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been extensively studied as drug targets in neurodegenerative diseases, but less is known about their role in healthy neurons. We tested zinc-dependent HDACs using RNAi in Drosophila melanogaster and found memory deficits with RPD3 and HDAC6. We demonstrate that HDAC6 is required in both the larval and adult stages for normal olfactory memory retention. Neuronal expression of HDAC6 rescued memory deficits, and we demonstrate that the N-terminal deacetylase (DAC) domain is required for this ability. This suggests that deacetylation of synaptic targets associated with the first DAC domain, such as the active-zone scaffold Bruchpilot, is required for memory retention. Finally, electrophysiological experiments at the neuromuscular junction reveal that HDAC6 mutants exhibit a partial block of homeostatic plasticity, suggesting that HDAC6 may be required for the stabilization of synaptic strength. The learning deficit we observe in HDAC6 mutants could be a behavioral consequence of these synaptic defects.",2017,"Sarah Perry, Beril Kiragasi, Dion Dickman, Anandasankar Ray, Sarah Perry, Beril Kiragasi, Dion Dickman, Anandasankar Ray"

The number of temporal contacts between sLNvs and DN2s peak before dawn. Our data suggest that the thermosensory anterior cells (ACs) likely contact sLNvs via serotonin signaling.

Downregulation of DmMANF in Glial Cells Results in Neurodegeneration and Affects Sleep and Lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,29163014,10.3389/fnins.2017.00610,"In Drosophila melanogaster, mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (DmMANF) is an evolutionarily conserved ortholog of mammalian MANF and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), which have been shown to promote the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. We observed especially high levels of DmMANF in the visual system of Drosophila, particularly in the first optic neuropil (lamina). In the lamina, DmMANF was found in glial cells (surface and epithelial glia), photoreceptors and interneurons. Interestingly, silencing of DmMANF in all neurons or specifically in photoreceptors or L2 interneurons had no impact on the structure of the visual system. However, downregulation of DmMANF in glial cells induced degeneration of the lamina. Remarkably, this degeneration in the form of holes and/or tightly packed membranes was observed only in the lamina epithelial glial cells. Those membranes seem to originate from the endoplasmic reticulum, which forms autophagosome membranes. Moreover, capitate projections, the epithelial glia invaginations into photoreceptor terminals that are involved in recycling of the photoreceptor neurotransmitter histamine, were less numerous after DmMANF silencing either in neurons or glial cells. The distribution of the alpha subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase protein in the lamina cell membranes was also changed. At the behavioral level, silencing of DmMANF either in neurons or glial cells affected the daily activity/sleep pattern, and flies showed less activity during the day but higher activity during the night than did controls.

The deployment of the Notch signaling pathway in numerous cellular contexts is possible due to its regulation at multiple levels. In an effort to identify the novel components integrated into the molecular circuitry affecting Notch signaling, we carried out a protein-protein interaction screen based on the identification of cellular protein complexes using co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass-spectrometry. We identified Hrp48, a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein in Drosophila, as a novel interacting partner of Deltex (Dx), a cytoplasmic modulator of Notch signaling. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that Dx and Hrp48 colocalize in cytoplasmic vesicles. The dx mutant also showed strong genetic interactions with hrp48 mutant alleles. The coexpression of Dx and Hrp48 resulted in the depletion of cytoplasmic Notch in larval wing imaginal discs and downregulation of Notch targets cut and wingless Previously, it has been shown that Sex-lethal (Sxl), on binding with Notch mRNA, negatively regulates Notch signaling. The overexpression of Hrp48 was found to inhibit Sxl expression and consequently rescued Notch signaling activity. In the present study, we observed that Dx together with Hrp48 can regulate Notch signaling in an Sxl-independent manner. In addition, Dx and Hrp48 displayed a synergistic effect on caspase-mediated cell death.

In this study, we examined the effect of mutational perturbations on different properties of environmental covariation, as well as mean shape. We use strains of Drosophila melanogaster bearing well-characterized mutations known to influence wing shape, as well as naturally derived strains, all reared under carefully controlled conditions and with the same genetic background. We find that mean shape changes more freely than the covariance structure, and that different properties of the covariance matrix change independently from each other. The perturbations affect matrix orientation more than they affect matrix eccentricity or total variance. Yet, mutational effects on matrix orientation do not cluster according to the developmental pathway that they target.

Dendritic Cytoskeletal Architecture Is Modulated by Combinatorial Transcriptional Regulation in Drosophila melanogaster,29025914,10.1534/genetics.117.300393,"Transcription factors (TFs) have emerged as essential cell autonomous mediators of subtype specific dendritogenesis; however, the downstream effectors of these TFs remain largely unknown, as are the cellular events that TFs control to direct morphological change. As dendritic morphology is largely dictated by the organization of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons, elucidating TF-mediated cytoskeletal regulatory programs is key to understanding molecular control of diverse dendritic morphologies. Previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated that the conserved TFs Cut and Knot exert combinatorial control over aspects of dendritic cytoskeleton development, promoting actin and MT-based arbor morphology, respectively. To investigate transcriptional targets of Cut and/or Knot regulation, we conducted systematic neurogenomic studies, coupled with in vivo genetic screens utilizing multi-fluor cytoskeletal and membrane marker reporters. These analyses identified a host of putative Cut and/or Knot effector molecules, and a subset of these putative TF targets converge on modulating dendritic cytoskeletal architecture, which are grouped into three major phenotypic categories, based upon neuromorphometric analyses: complexity enhancer, complexity shifter, and complexity suppressor. Complexity enhancer genes normally function to promote higher order dendritic growth and branching with variable effects on MT stabilization and F-actin organization, whereas complexity shifter and complexity suppressor genes normally function in regulating proximal-distal branching distribution or in restricting higher order branching complexity, respectively, with spatially restricted impacts on the dendritic cytoskeleton.

Differential attraction of drosophilids to banana baits inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Hanseniaspora uvarum within a Neotropical forest remnant,28289566,10.7717/peerj.3063,"Background:
      
    

    
      Yeasts are a necessary requisite in the diet of most Drosophila species that, in turn, may vector their dispersal in natural environments. Differential attractiveness experiments and the isolation of yeasts consumed by Drosophila may be informative for characterizing this association. Hanseniaspora uvarum is among the most common yeast species isolated from Drosophila crops, with high attractiveness to drosophilids. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used to collect flies, and it allows broad sampling of almost all local Drosophila species. Pronounced differences in the field concerning Drosophila attractivity to baits seeded with these yeast species have been previously reported. However, few explicit generalizations have been set. Since late fifties, no field experiments of Drosophila attractivity were carried out in the Neotropical region, which is facing shifts in abiotic and biotic factors. Our objective is to characterize preference behavior that mediates the interaction in the wild among Neotropical Drosophila species and yeasts associated with them. We want to set a broad generalization about drosophilids attracted to these yeasts. Here we present the results of a differential attractiveness experiment we carried out in a natural Atlantic Rainforest fragment to assess the preferences of Drosophila species groups to baits inoculated with H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Both yeast species were cultured in GYMP broth and separately poured in autoclaved mashed banana that was left fermenting. In the field, we collected drosophilids over five arrays of three different baits: non-inoculated autoclaved banana and banana inoculated with each yeast. In the laboratory the drosophilids were sorted to five sets according to their external morphology and/or genitalia: tripunctata; guarani; willistoni; exotic; and the remaining flies pooled in others.
    

    
  


        Results and conclusions:
      
    

    
      Uninoculated banana baits attracted virtually no flies. We found significant departures from random distribution over the other two baits (1:1 proportion) for all sets, except the pooled others. Flies of the sets willistoni and exotic preferred H. uvarum over S. cerevisiae, while the remaining sets were more attracted to S. cerevisiae. Previously, various authors reported similar patterns in attraction experiments with S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum. It is also noteworthy that both yeast species have been isolated from natural substrates and crops of Drosophila species. Taken together, these results suggest that the preferences among Drosophila species groups may be reflecting deep and stable relations with yeast species in natural environments. They can be summarized as: forest dwelling species from subgenus Drosophila (such as tripunctata and guarani groups) are attracted to banana baits seeded with S. cerevisiae; while exotic (as D. melanogaster) and subgenus Sophophora species are preferentially attracted to baits seeded with H. uvarum.",2017,"Marcos R D Batista, Fabiana Uno, Rafael D Chaves, Rosana Tidon, Carlos A Rosa, Louis B Klaczko, Marcos R D Batista, Fabiana Uno, Rafael D Chaves, Rosana Tidon, Carlos A Rosa, Louis B Klaczko"
Characterization of dFOXO binding sites upstream of the Insulin Receptor P2 promoter across the Drosophila phylogeny,29200426,10.1371/journal.pone.0188357,"The insulin/TOR signal transduction pathway plays a critical role in determining such important traits as body and organ size, metabolic homeostasis and life span. Although this pathway is highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the affected traits can exhibit important differences even between closely related species. Evolutionary studies of regulatory regions require the reliable identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here we have focused on the Insulin Receptor (InR) expression from its P2 promoter in the Drosophila genus, which in D. melanogaster is up-regulated by hypophosphorylated Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO). We have finely characterized this transcription factor binding sites in vitro along the 1.3 kb region upstream of the InR P2 promoter in five Drosophila species. Moreover, we have tested the effect of mutations in the characterized dFOXO sites of D. melanogaster in transgenic flies. The number of experimentally established binding sites varies across the 1.3 kb region of any particular species, and their distribution also differs among species. In D. melanogaster, InR expression from P2 is differentially affected by dFOXO binding sites at the proximal and distal halves of the species 1.3 kb fragment. The observed uneven distribution of binding sites across this fragment might underlie their differential contribution to regulate InR transcription.",2017,"Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Elvira Juan, Dorcas J Orengo, Montserrat AguadÃ©, Elvira Juan"
Insights into DDT Resistance from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel,28935691,10.1534/genetics.117.300310,"Insecticide resistance is considered a classic model of microevolution, where a strong selective agent is applied to a large natural population, resulting in a change in frequency of alleles that confer resistance. While many insecticide resistance variants have been characterized at the gene level, they are typically single genes of large effect identified in highly resistant pest species. In contrast, multiple variants have been implicated in DDT resistance in Drosophila melanogaster; however, only the Cyp6g1 locus has previously been shown to be relevant to field populations. Here we use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify DDT-associated polygenes and use selective sweep analyses to assess their adaptive significance. We identify and verify two candidate DDT resistance loci. A largely uncharacterized gene, CG10737, has a function in muscles that ameliorates the effects of DDT, while a putative detoxifying P450, Cyp6w1, shows compelling evidence of positive selection.",2017,"Joshua M Schmidt, Paul Battlay, Rebecca S Gledhill-Smith, Robert T Good, Chris Lumb, Alexandre Fournier-Level, Charles Robin, Joshua M Schmidt, Paul Battlay, Rebecca S Gledhill-Smith, Robert T Good, Chris Lumb, Alexandre Fournier-Level, Charles Robin"
A Hidden Markov Model Approach for Simultaneously Estimating Local Ancestry and Admixture Time Using Next Generation Sequence Data in Samples of Arbitrary Ploidy,28045893,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006529,"Admixture-the mixing of genomes from divergent populations-is increasingly appreciated as a central process in evolution. To characterize and quantify patterns of admixture across the genome, a number of methods have been developed for local ancestry inference. However, existing approaches have a number of shortcomings. First, all local ancestry inference methods require some prior assumption about the expected ancestry tract lengths. Second, existing methods generally require genotypes, which is not feasible to obtain for many next-generation sequencing projects. Third, many methods assume samples are diploid, however a wide variety of sequencing applications will fail to meet this assumption. To address these issues, we introduce a novel hidden Markov model for estimating local ancestry that models the read pileup data, rather than genotypes, is generalized to arbitrary ploidy, and can estimate the time since admixture during local ancestry inference. We demonstrate that our method can simultaneously estimate the time since admixture and local ancestry with good accuracy, and that it performs well on samples of high ploidy-i.e. 100 or more chromosomes. As this method is very general, we expect it will be useful for local ancestry inference in a wider variety of populations than what previously has been possible. We then applied our method to pooled sequencing data derived from populations of Drosophila melanogaster on an ancestry cline on the east coast of North America. We find that regions of local recombination rates are negatively correlated with the proportion of African ancestry, suggesting that selection against foreign ancestry is the least efficient in low recombination regions. Finally we show that clinal outlier loci are enriched for genes associated with gene regulatory functions, consistent with a role of regulatory evolution in ecological adaptation of admixed D. melanogaster populations. Our results illustrate the potential of local ancestry inference for elucidating fundamental evolutionary processes.",2017,"Russell Corbett-Detig, Rasmus Nielsen, Russell Corbett-Detig, Rasmus Nielsen"
Genomic responses to the socio-sexual environment in male Drosophila melanogaster exposed to conspecific rivals,28428330,10.1261/rna.059246.116,"Socio-sexual environments have profound effects on fitness. Local sex ratios can alter the threat of sexual competition, to which males respond via plasticity in reproductive behaviors and ejaculate composition. In Drosophila melanogaster, males detect the presence of conspecific, same-sex mating rivals prior to mating using multiple, redundant sensory cues. Males that respond to rivals gain significant fitness benefits by altering mating duration and ejaculate composition. Here we investigated the underlying genome-wide changes involved. We used RNA-seq to analyze male transcriptomic responses 2, 26, and 50 h after exposure to rivals, a time period that was previously identified as encompassing the major facets of male responses to rivals. The results showed a strong early activation of multiple sensory genes in the head-thorax (HT), prior to the expression of any phenotypic differences. This gene expression response was reduced by 26 h, at the time of maximum phenotypic change, and shut off by 50 h. In the abdomen (A), fewer genes changed in expression and gene expression responses appeared to increase over time. The results also suggested that different sets of functionally equivalent genes might be activated in different replicates. This could represent a mechanism by which robustness is conferred upon highly plastic traits. Overall, our study reveals that mRNA-seq can identify subtle genomic signatures characteristic of flexible behavioral phenotypes.",2017,"Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman, Irina Mohorianu, Amanda Bretman, Damian T Smith, Emily K Fowler, Tamas Dalmay, Tracey Chapman"
Retroviruses in invertebrates: the gypsy retrotransposon is apparently an infectious retrovirus of Drosophila melanogaster,8108403,10.1073/pnas.91.4.1285,"Retroviruses are commonly considered to be restricted to vertebrates. However, the genome of many eukaryotes contains mobile sequences known as retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR retrotransposons) or viral retrotransposons, showing similarities with integrated proviruses of retroviruses, such as Ty elements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copia-like elements in Drosophila, and endogenous proviruses in vertebrates. The gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster has LTRs and contains three open reading frames, one of which encodes potential products similar to gag-specific protease, reverse transcriptase, and endonuclease. It is more similar to typical retroviruses than to LTR retrotransposons. We report here experiments showing that gypsy can be transmitted by microinjecting egg plasma from embryos of a strain containing actively transposing gypsy elements into embryos of a strain originally devoid of transposing elements. Horizontal transfer is also observed when individuals of the ""empty"" stock are raised on medium containing ground pupae of the stock possessing transposing elements. These results suggest that gypsy is an infectious retrovirus and provide evidence that retroviruses also occur in invertebrates.",1994,"A Kim, C Terzian, P Santamaria, A PÃ©lisson, N Purd'homme, A Bucheton, A Kim, C Terzian, P Santamaria, A PÃ©lisson, N Purd'homme, A Bucheton"
Characterization of the KLP68D kinesin-like protein in Drosophila: possible roles in axonal transport,7525600,10.1083/jcb.127.4.1041,"This paper describes the molecular and biochemical properties of KLP68D, a new kinesin-like motor protein in Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA encoding KLP68D demonstrates that this protein has a domain that shares significant sequence identity with the entire 340-amin acid kinesin heavy chain motor domain. Sequences extending beyond the motor domain predict a region of alpha-helical coiled-coil followed by a globular ""tail"" region; there is significant sequence similarity between the alpha-helical coiled-coil region of the KLP68D protein and similar regions of the KIF3 protein of mouse and the KRP85 protein of sea urchin. This finding suggests that all three proteins may be members of the same family, and that they all perform related functions. KLP68D protein produced in Escherichia coli is, like kinesin itself, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. In situ hybridization analysis of KLP68D RNA in Drosophila embryos indicates that the KLP68D gene is expressed primarily in the central nervous system and in a subset of the peripheral nervous system during embryogenesis. Thus, KLP68D may be used for anterograde axonal transport and could conceivably move cargoes in fly neurons different than those moved by kinesin heavy chain or other plus-end directed motors.",1994,"P A Pesavento, R J Stewart, L S Goldstein, P A Pesavento, R J Stewart, L S Goldstein"
Egalitarian and the choice of cell fates in Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis,7835153,,"Oogenesis in Drosophila females begins with the formation of a cyst of 16 interconnected sister cells, one of which eventually becomes the definitive oocyte. The other 15 become nurse cells, performing nutritive roles for the oocyte. There are four alternative developmental pathways in each cyst: winning pro-oocyte, losing pro-oocyte and cells with three ring canals, all of which enter meiosis, and the twelve obligate pro-nurse cells, which do not. In flies homozygous for the female-sterile mutation egalitarian (egl) all 16 cells follow the same intermediate pathway. All nuclei enter meiosis (shown by their attainment of synaptonemal complex of at least mid-zygotene levels and by their attainment of pachytene numbers and locations of recombination nodules), then all exit it and become morphologically indistinguishable from nurse cells in wild-type flies. The wild-type allele of egl therefore performs two active but opposite roles in cell fate choice. Early on it is necessary for inhibition of meiotic entry in the 'obligate' pro-nurse cells; later it is necessary for meiotic maintenance in the 'winning' pro-oocyte. One can account for both roles from a single function by invoking gradients through the early cyst; the egl+ function appears to be required for the normal function of these gradients.",1994,"A T Carpenter, A T Carpenter"
Genetics of a nonoptimal behavior: oviposition preference of Drosophila mauritiana for a toxic resource,7993320,10.1007/BF01076179,"Among three sibling species of the D. melanogaster subgroup, two are generalists (D. simulans and D. mauritiana), while the third, D. sechellia, specializes on a single toxic resource, the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. D. sechellia, resistant to the toxics, prefers to oviposit on morinda; D. simulans, which is very sensitive, is strongly repelled. D. mauritiana exhibits an aberrant behavior since it prefers to lay its eggs on morinda, where its embryos are killed. Oviposition behavior, studied in parental species, F1 hybrids, and backcrosses, was mostly an additive genetical trait. Further investigations were made with D. mauritiana and D. simulans carrying recessive markers. The X and second chromosomes had no effect, while a clear effect was found for chromosome 3. Since the toxicity of morinda is due to middle-length fatty acids, the behavior of the three species toward various acids was investigated. We found that D. sechellia exhibited a general oviposition preference for acids, while D. simulans was repelled by acids with at least four carbons. Surprisingly D. mauritiana exhibited behavior quite similar to that of D. simulans. Preference for morinda in D. sechellia and D. mauritiana could be mediated by different chemicals.",1994,"B Moreteau, S R'Kha, J R David, B Moreteau, S R'Kha, J R David"
Evidence for positive selection in the superoxide dismutase (Sod) region of Drosophila melanogaster,8013910,,"DNA sequence variation in a 1410-bp region including the Cu,Zn Sod locus was examined in 41 homozygous lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Fourteen lines were from Barcelona, Spain, 25 were from California populations and the other two were from laboratory stocks. Two common electromorphs, SODS and SODF, are segregating in the populations. Our sample of 41 lines included 19 SodS and 22 SodF alleles (henceforward referred to as Slow and Fast alleles). All 19 Slow alleles were identical in sequence. Of the 22 Fast alleles sequenced, nine were identical in sequence and are referred to as the Fast A haplotypes. The Slow allele sequence differed from the Fast A haplotype at a single nucleotide site, the site that accounts for the amino acid difference between SODS and SODF. There were nine other haplotypes among the remaining 13 Fast alleles sequenced. The overall level of nucleotide diversity (pi) in this sample is not greatly different than that found at other loci in D. melanogaster. It is concluded that the Slow/Fast polymorphism is a recently arisen polymorphism, not an old balanced polymorphism. The large group of nearly identical haplotypes suggests that a recent mutation, at the Sod locus or tightly linked to it, has increased rapidly in frequency to around 50%, both in California and Spain. The application of a new statistical test demonstrates that the occurrence of such large numbers of haplotypes with so little variation among them is very unlikely under the usual equilibrium neutral model. We suggest that the high frequency of some haplotypes is due to natural selection at the Sod locus or at a tightly linked locus.",1994,"R R Hudson, K Bailey, D Skarecky, J Kwiatowski, F J Ayala, R R Hudson, K Bailey, D Skarecky, J Kwiatowski, F J Ayala"

Although this gene is experiencing a higher rate of synonymous substitution than Adh, it is more constrained at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic relationships between all eight members of the melanogaster subgroup have been analyzed using a variety of methods.

Regulatory and coding regions of the segmentation gene hunchback are functionally conserved between Drosophila virilis and Drosophila melanogaster,8199047,10.1016/0925-4773(94)90024-8,"The segmentation gene hunchback (hb) is involved in setting up the anterior-posterior axis of the Drosophila embryo. It is expressed maternally and zygotically and it plays a key role in integrating the effects of the anterior and posterior maternal systems. The hb gene from D. virilis has previously been cloned and was shown to be well conserved in its coding region, but less so in its upstream region which shows a more patchy pattern of conserved and diverged sequences. This work deals with the functional conservation of hb between the two species. We have mapped two additional regulatory elements for the expression of hb in the early embryo, namely the enhancer for the maternal expression and the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression. Fragments containing these two elements, the previously identified bicoid dependent element for the early blastoderm expression of hb and the coding region were taken from D. virilis and tested in the D. melanogaster background. We find that all enhancer elements as well as the coding region are functionally conserved between the two species. Comparison of the upstream sequences that include the enhancer region for the late blastoderm expression reveal seven highly conserved blocks. Some of these contain consensus binding sites for transregulatory factors that are likely to control the respective expression domains.",1994,"W Lukowitz, C SchrÃ¶der, G Glaser, M HÃ¼lskamp, D Tautz, W Lukowitz, C SchrÃ¶der, G Glaser, M HÃ¼lskamp, D Tautz"
Drosophila virilis oskar transgenes direct body patterning but not pole cell formation or maintenance of mRNA localization in D. melanogaster,7925007,,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene oskar is required for both posterior body patterning and germline formation in the early embryo; precisely how oskar functions is unknown. The oskar transcript is localized to the posterior pole of the developing oocyte, and oskar mRNA and protein are maintained at the pole through early embryogenesis. The posterior maintenance of oskar mRNA is dependent upon the presence of oskar protein. We have cloned and characterized the Drosophila virilis oskar homologue, virosk, and examined its activity as a transgene in Drosophila melanogaster flies. We find that the cis-acting mRNA localization signals are conserved, although the virosk transcript also transiently accumulates at novel intermediate sites. The virosk protein, however, shows substantial differences from oskar: while virosk is able to rescue body patterning in a D. melanogaster oskar- background, it is impaired in both mRNA maintenance and pole cell formation. Furthermore, virosk induces a dominant maternal-effect lethality when introduced into a wild-type background, and interferes with the posterior maintenance of the endogenous oskar transcript in early embryogenesis. Our data suggest that virosk protein is unable to anchor at the posterior pole of the early embryo; this defect could account for all of the characteristics of virosk mentioned above. Our observations support a model in which oskar protein functions both by nucleating the factors necessary for the activation of the posterior body patterning determinant and the germ cell determinant, and by anchoring these factors to the posterior pole of the embryo. While the posterior body patterning determinant need not be correctly localized to provide body patterning activity, the germ cell determinant may need to be highly concentrated adjacent to the cortex in order to direct pole cell formation.",1994,"P J Webster, J Suen, P M Macdonald, P J Webster, J Suen, P M Macdonald"
Polytene chromosomes from ovarian pseudonurse cells of the Drosophila melanogaster otu mutant. II. Photographic map of the X chromosome,8013253,10.1007/BF00364721,The banding pattern of the polytene chromosomes of the ovarian pseudonurse cells (PNC) of the Drosophila melanogaster otu mutant were compared with larval salivary gland (SG) polytene chromosomes. The X chromosome was studied and no significant differences were found in the banding pattern between these functionally very different tissues. Most of the differences result from differential puffing activity. In situ hybridisation with five different DNA probes located along the X chromosome was used to cross-check the results obtained by morphological mapping. The constrictions present in the SG chromosomes were found to be absent in the germ line derived PNC chromosomes. There are prominent puffs in the PNC chromosomes at certain locations where genes known to be transcriptionally active in the germ line reside. This suggests that at least some of the genes active in the wild-type nurse cells may also be active in the PNC cells.,1994,"T I Heino, T I Heino"
Behavioural correlates of selection for oviposition by Drosophila melanogaster females in a patchy environment,8077111,10.1038/hdy.1994.105,"The behaviour of females from lines selected for high (H) and low (L) aggregated oviposition was compared in an environment consisting of discrete patches of resource available for larval development. Oviposition behaviour was influenced by the conformation and by the texture of the substrate, but this does not account for the selective differences in levels of aggregation which are under genetic control. The distribution of males of both selected populations tends to be overdispersed across resource patches. This observation is consistent with male territorial behaviour. The dispersal patterns of females of the two selected populations differ significantly. H females show a contagious distribution whereas the distribution for L females is more nearly random. Differences in adult female dispersion are likely to be a significant factor contributing to aggregated oviposition. The level of aggregated oviposition affects the pattern of progeny survival when the unit of resource in each patch is small.",1994,"G Ruiz-Dubreuil, B Burnet, K Connolly, G Ruiz-Dubreuil, B Burnet, K Connolly"

It binds single-stranded DNA very tightly via the large subunit. The complete protein has at least a 10- to 20-fold preference for single-stranded DNA over double-stranded DNA and it appears that binding is only weakly co-operative. Band shift experiments suggest that it has an approximate site covering the size of 16 nucleotides or less, however, it shows a greater affinity for long oligonucleotides than for short ones. We also demonstrate that dRP-A can stimulate the activity of its homologous DNA polymerase alpha in excess of 20 fold.

Precision and plasticity during Drosophila neuromuscular development,8050672,10.1096/fasebj.8.10.8050672,"Synaptogenesis can be analyzed in a simple array of motoneurons and muscle fibers of the embryos and larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. Each abdominal hemisegment contains a stereotypic array of 30 muscle fibers. During middle to late embryogenesis, motoneurons exit the central nervous system to make precise synaptic connections with specific muscle fibers. Target recognition has been tested using both genetic and microsurgical manipulations, which indicate that motoneurons actively recognize specific muscle fibers. The molecular basis of target recognition has been examined by screens for mutations that disrupt both guidance events and correct innervation. In addition, the motoneurons and muscle fibers both express an array of putative cell adhesion molecules whose functions may contribute to normal connectivity. Postsynaptic specializations, including glutamate receptor distribution, depend on innervation and neural activity. The neuromuscular system is not ""hardwired,"" as motoneurons are capable of altering both their branch arborizations and connectivity in response to local denervation and blockade of synaptic function. Collectively, these studies show that the Drosophila motor innervation is a powerful model system for testing at the cellular and molecular level the mechanisms that govern synaptic development.",1994,"H Keshishian, T N Chang, J Jarecki, H Keshishian, T N Chang, J Jarecki"

All larvae were strongly attracted to propyl acetate, irrespective of the dose studied. Larval olfactory responses generally declined with age. Two geographical strains showed specific anosmias. Katsunuma (Japan) larvae showed no response to hexyl acetate; chromosome substitution showed this behaviour to be controlled by genes on chromosome II.

Calpain localization changes in coordination with actin-related cytoskeletal changes during early embryonic development of Drosophila,7929201,,"Calpain, a calcium-dependent intracellular protease, was identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila calpain has an amino acid sequence highly homologous to those of mammalian calpains and exhibits a distinct domain structure consisting of cysteine protease and calcium-binding domains. Specific antibodies raised against a recombinant calpain fragment were used to identify the localization of calpain in developing Drosophila embryos. Calpain was first detected near the anterior pole and in posterior region of the embryo just after fertilization. The anterior calpain disappeared during the cleavage cycles. On the other hand, the posterior calpain moved to the posterior pole when polar buds were formed, and condensed just below the pole cells. At cleavage cycles 8 and 9, when nuclei reached the egg surface, calpain was localized between the nuclei at the surface beneath the precleavage furrows. Co-staining experiments with anti-actin antibody revealed that calpain condenses specifically at the edge of and between actin caps that underlie the plasma membrane immediately above each nucleus.

The first repeat array consists of five repeats of 338-373 bp. The second consists of four intact 464-bp repeats and a fifth partial repeat of 137 bp. Three DNA sequence elements are found to be highly conserved in D. melanogaster and in several Drosophila species with short A+T regions. These include a 300-bp DNA sequence element that overlaps the DNA replication origin and two thymidylate stretches identified on opposite DNA strands. We conclude that the length heterogeneity observed in the A+T regulatory region in mitochondrial DNAs from the genus Drosophila results from the expansion (and contraction) of the number of repeated DNA sequence elements.

Divergence between the two species is not reduced.

The coding regions of the gene in these mutants were sequenced and mutations changing Ser374 to Phe in AceIJ29 and Pro75 to Leu in AceIJ40 were found. Acetylcholinesterases bearing these mutations were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and we found that these mutations decrease the secretion rate of the protein most probably by affecting its folding. This phenomenon is exacerbated at restrictive temperatures decreasing the amount of secreted acetylcholinesterase below the lethality threshold. In parallel, the substitution of the conserved Asp248 by an Asn residue completely inhibits the activity of the enzyme and its secretion, preventing the correct folding of the protein in a non-conditional manner.",1994,"A Mutero, J M Bride, M Pralavorio, D Fournier, A Mutero, J M Bride, M Pralavorio, D Fournier"

At the molecular level, a portion of the putative cytoplasmic domain of Eag is a substrate of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

Characterization of two Segregation distorter revertants: evidence that the tandem duplication is necessary for Sd activity in Drosophila melanogaster,8138158,,"Segregation Distorter (SD) is a naturally occurring system of meiotic drive in Drosophila melanogaster. Males heterozygous for an SD second chromosome and a normal homolog (SD+) transmit predominantly SD-bearing sperm. To accomplish this, the Segregation distorter (Sd) locus induces the dysfunction of those spermatids that receive the SD+ chromosome. Recently, P. A. Powers and B. Ganetzky isolated overlapping DNA clones spanning the region of DNA known to contain the Sd gene and identified a 5-kb tandem duplication that is present on all SD chromosomes examined, but is apparently absent from wild-type chromosomes. Here we report a molecular analysis of two spontaneous revertants from an Australian SD chromosome (SD-Arm28). Both of these revertants have lost the 5-kb tandem duplication along with the ability to distort transmission; the critical observation, however, is that they retain the DNA haplotype in the flanking regions (both proximally and distally) that is characteristic of the original SD-Arm28. We propose unequal sister chromatid exchange between the tandem repeats as the only plausible explanation for loss of a repeat while retaining flanking markers. This provides direct evidence that the tandem duplication is indeed necessary for the Sd phenotype. Further, we examined testes-specific levels of both RNA and protein for the nearby Topoisomerase 2 gene. Neither revealed a consistent difference between SD and SD+ strains. We also measured testes-specific levels of RNA using the tandem duplication itself as probe. Our results suggest that there is strong up-regulation of one or several 2.0-2.3-kb transcripts from the duplicated region in the testes of an SD strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,"M F Palopoli, P Doshi, C I Wu, M F Palopoli, P Doshi, C I Wu"
A deficiency for nucleotide excision repair strongly potentiates the mutagenic effectiveness of methyl bromide in Drosophila,7968583,10.1093/mutage/9.4.387,"A DNA repair assay measuring hypermutability response in the absence of nucleotide excision repair (NER) was employed to study the impact of a deficiency in NER on the induction of forward mutations (X-chromosomal recessive lethals) by methyl bromide (MeBr) in Drosophila melanogaster. Postmeiotic male germ-cell stages reacted with MeBr were introduced in either NER competent oocytes (exr+) or in cells from the NER- strain mus-201. The high average M(exr-)/M(exr+) hypermutability ratio of 8.3 determined for MeBr is similar to the M(exr-)/M(exr+) indices found for other monofunctional alkylating agents with high Swain-Scott s values, such as methyl methanesulphonate and dimethyl sulphate. It is concluded that the genotoxic profile of methyl bromide is in keeping with those of high s-value alkylating agents but it seems incompatible with a methylating agent producing substantial amounts of O6 methylguanine.",1994,"L A Ballering, M J Nivard, E W Vogel, L A Ballering, M J Nivard, E W Vogel"
"Transcription of Djun from D. melanogaster is positively regulated by DTF-1, AP-1, and CREB binding sites",8082742,10.1006/excr.1994.1272,"Djun is the homolog of the mammalian proto-oncogene jun in D. melanogaster, where it encodes a component of an AP-1-like nuclear DNA binding protein, or transcription factor. Djun, unlike its vertebrate counterparts, contains an intron in its 5' noncoding region. The expression of Djun in cultured Schneider line 2 cells is controlled by multiple cis-acting elements in its promoter region and the 5' noncoding region of the transcription unit. A 43-bp 5' upstream promoter region is necessary for the transcription activity of Djun. Deletion of this fragment decreased transcriptional activity by 67-fold. This region includes a TATA box and a sequence similar to the Drosophila transcription factor 1 (DTF-1) consensus sequence (GCAACAT/GC/C). A large DNase I footprint covering both the DTF-1 binding site and the TATA box was detected in this region when incubated with nuclear extract from Drosophila embryos, suggesting interactions with related transcription factors. This 43-bp sequence alone, containing the DTF-1 binding site and TATA box, however, is not sufficient for transcription activity. An 80-bp sequence including the start of transcription has considerable basal activity. An intragenic region containing an AP-1 site and a CRE site modulates or fine tunes activity of the promoter. Its activity as an enhancer is reduced when moved upstream in either orientation. An extragenic region containing two AP-1 sites similarly affects promoter activity.",1994,"G L Wang, E S Goldstein, G L Wang, E S Goldstein"
Genetic and transgenic approaches to dissecting muscle development and contractility using the Drosophila model system,21244874,10.1016/1050-1738(94)90027-2,"Both genetic and transgenic analyses of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, are providing important insights into the mechanisms of muscle cell determination and development, myofibril assembly, and muscle contraction. This model system affords tremendous advantages such as ease of isolating mutants defective in these processes, determining the identity of affected genes, and analyzing protein function by transformation with in vitro mutagenized versions of such genes. These approaches have identified a series of proteins that are critical to mesoderm and muscle determination, many of which are likely to serve similar roles in vertebrates. The effects of mutating structural protein genes upon myofibril assembly and function in Drosophila help to define the differential roles of contractile protein isoforms and the importance of proper protein stoichiometry for physiologic function.

Chromosomal homogeneity of Drosophila ribosomal DNA arrays suggests intrachromosomal exchanges drive concerted evolution,7820547,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00175-5,"Background:
      
    

    
      The individual copies of tandemly repeated genes, such as ribosomal DNA (rDNA), evolve coordinately within a species. This phenomenon has been called concerted evolution, and is thought to be caused by sequence-homogenizing mechanisms, such as gene conversion or unequal crossing-over between individual copies of the gene family. As these processes would act between the arrays on homologous and non-homologous chromosomes, the whole family of repeats would be expected to undergo homogenization in a given interbreeding population.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In order to study the homogenization process, we have examined polymorphisms within the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rDNA in populations of Drosophila melanogaster at the sequence level, by DNA sequencing and temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis. Among 84 ITS clones sequenced from five different wild-type strains, we found three polymorphic sites that are apparently in the process of homogenization. However, these three sites, as well as combinations of them, occurred at different frequencies in the different strains. Moreover, temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of an ITS fragment including these three sites shows that single chromosomes from locally interbreeding populations can harbor rDNA arrays that are largely homogenized for different sequence variants.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The presence of chromosomal arrays that are homogeneous for different variants in interbreeding populations of Drosophila melanogaster indicates that there is little recombination between the chromosomes while new mutations are being homogenized along the individual arrays. The most likely explanation for this finding is that intrachromosomal recombination events occur at much higher rates than recombination between homologous chromosomes. Thus, the first step of the homogenization process would occur mainly within chromosomal lines. Such behavior of tandem repeat arrays suggests a simple explanation of how selection can act on a multigene family, namely by acting on whole chromosomally confined repeat arrays rather than on individual repeat units.",1994,"C SchlÃ¶tterer, D Tautz, C SchlÃ¶tterer, D Tautz"
Aspects of nonrandom turnover involved in the concerted evolution of intergenic spacers within the ribosomal DNA of Drosophila melanogaster,7932779,10.1007/BF00163804,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, sequenced, and digitally typed intergenic spacers (IGSs) of the ribosomal (r)DNA in D. melanogaster reveal unexpected features of the mechanisms of turnover involved with the concerted evolution of the gene family. Characterization of the structure of three isolated IGS length variants reveals breakage ""hot spots"" within the 330-base-pair (bp) subrepeat array found in the spacers. Internal mapping of variant repeats within the 240-bp subrepeat array using a novel digital DNA typing procedure (minisatellite variant repeat [MVR]-PCR) shows an unexpected pattern of clustering of variant repeats. Each 240-bp subrepeat array consists of essentially two halves with the repeats in each half identified by specific mutations. This bipartite structure, observed in a cloned IGS unit, in the majority of genomic DNA of laboratory and wild flies and in PCR-amplified products, has been widely homogenized yet is not predicted by a model of unequal crossing over with randomly placed recombination breakpoints. Furthermore, wild populations contain large numbers of length variants in contrast to uniformly shared length variants in laboratory stocks. High numbers of length variants coupled to the observation of a homogenized bipartite structure of the 240-bp subrepeat array suggest that the unit of turnover and homogenization is smaller than the IGS and might involve gene conversion. The use of PCR for the structural analysis of members of the rDNA gene family coupled to digital DNA typing provides powerful new inroads into the mechanisms of DNA turnover affecting the course of molecular evolution in this family.",1994,"A R Linares, T Bowen, G A Dover, A R Linares, T Bowen, G A Dover"

This approach yielded three discrete amplified sequence elements (designated LCCH1, LCCH2, and LCCH3) that contained open reading frames and > 40% amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding regions of vertebrate ligand-gated chloride channel genes. Genomic DNA clones corresponding to each element were isolated and sequenced, and predicted amino acid sequences corresponding to the second (M2) and third (M3) transmembrane domains of vertebrate genes were analyzed for identity or similarity to known sequences. LCCH1 was identical to the Rdl gene, a known GABA receptor subunit gene from D. melanogaster, whereas LCCH2 and LCCH3 were novel D. melanogaster sequences that exhibited structural similarity to other members of the ligand-gated chloride channel gene family. LCCH2 was equally divergent in M2 and M3 (46-49% amino acid identity) from all other known members of this family and may therefore represent a new subunit or receptor class within this family. LCCH2 was localized by in situ hybridization to cytogenetic region 75A on the left arm of chromosome 3. LCCH3 was closely related to mammalian (79% amino acid identity) and snail (96% amino acid identity) GABA receptor beta subunits and may therefore be the homologue in D. melanogaster of this subunit class.

Analysis of the hypoxia-sensing pathway in Drosophila melanogaster,16176182,10.1042/BJ20050675,"The mechanism by which hypoxia induces gene transcription involves the inhibition of HIF-1alpha (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha subunit) PHD (prolyl hydroxylase) activity, which prevents the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau)-dependent targeting of HIF-1alpha to the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. HIF-1alpha thus accumulates and promotes gene transcription. In the present study, first we provide direct biochemical evidence for the presence of a conserved hypoxic signalling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. An assay for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases was developed using Drosophila embryonic and larval homogenates as a source of enzyme. Drosophila PHD has a low substrate specificity and hydroxylates key proline residues in the ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation) domains of human HIF-1alpha and Similar, the Drosophila homologue of HIF-1alpha. The enzyme promotes human and Drosophila [(35)S]VHL binding to GST (glutathione S-transferase)-ODD-domain fusion protein. Hydroxylation is enhanced by proteasomal inhibitors and was ascertained using an anti-hydroxyproline antibody. Secondly, by using transgenic flies expressing a fusion protein that combined an ODD domain and the green fluorescent protein (ODD-GFP), we analysed the hypoxic cascade in different embryonic and larval tissues. Hypoxic accumulation of the reporter protein was observed in the whole tracheal tree, but not in the ectoderm. Hypoxic stabilization of ODD-GFP in the ectoderm was restored by inducing VHL expression in these cells.

      Proteins control and mediate many biological activities of cells by interacting with other protein partners. This work presents a statistical model to predict protein interaction networks of Drosophila melanogaster based on insight into domain interactions.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Three high-throughput yeast two-hybrid experiments and the collection in FlyBase were used as our starting datasets. The co-occurrences of domains in these interactive events are converted into a probability score of domain-domain interaction. These scores are used to infer putative interaction among all available open reading frames (ORFs) of fruit fly. Additionally, the likelihood function is used to estimate all potential protein-protein interactions. All parameters are successfully iterated and MLE is obtained for each pair of domains. Additionally, the maximized likelihood reaches its converged criteria and maintains the probability stable. The hybrid model achieves a high specificity with a loss of sensitivity, suggesting that the model may possess major features of protein-protein interactions. Several putative interactions predicted by the proposed hybrid model are supported by literatures, while experimental data with a low probability score indicate an uncertain reliability and require further proof of interaction.Fly-DPI is the online database used to present this work. It is an integrated proteomics tool with comprehensive protein annotation information from major databases as well as an effective means of predicting protein-protein interactions.

Proceedings of the SMBE Tri-National Young Investigators' Workshop 2005. Unusual evolution of interspersed repeat sequences in the Drosophila ananassae subgroup,16467489,10.1093/molbev/msj105,"New repeat sequences were found in the Drosophila ananassae genome sequence. They accounted for approximately 1.2% of the D. ananassae genome and were estimated to be more abundant in genomes of its closely related species belonging to the Drosophila bipectinata complex, whereas it was entirely absent in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. They were interspersed throughout euchromatic regions of the genome, usually as short tandem arrays of unit sequences, which were mostly 175-200 bp long with two distinct peaks at 180 and 189 bp in the length distribution. The nucleotide differences among unit sequences within the same array (locus) were much smaller than those between separate loci, suggesting within-locus concerted evolution. The phylogenetic tree of the repeat sequences from different loci showed that divergences between sequences from different chromosome arms occurred only at earlier stages of evolution, while those within the same chromosome arm occurred thereafter, resulting in the increase in copy number. We found RNA polymerase III promoter sequences (A box and B box), which play a critical role in retroposition of short interspersed elements. We also found conserved stem-loop structures, which are possibly associated with certain DNA rearrangements responsible for the increase in copy number within a chromosome arm. Such an atypical combination of characteristics (i.e., wide dispersal and tandem repetition) may have been generated by these different transposition mechanisms during the course of evolution.",2006,"Masafumi Nozawa, Masahiko Kumagai, Tadashi Aotsuka, Koichiro Tamura, SMBE Tri-National Young Investigators, Masafumi Nozawa, Masahiko Kumagai, Tadashi Aotsuka, Koichiro Tamura, SMBE Tri-National Young Investigators"
Expression of a functional Drosophila melanogaster CMP-sialic acid synthetase. Differential localization of the Drosophila and human enzymes,16537535,10.1074/jbc.M512186200,"CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid is a critical metabolite in the generation of glycoconjugates that play a role in development and other physiological processes. Whereas pathways for its generation are firmly established in vertebrates, the presence and function of the relevant synthetic enzyme in insects and other protostomes is unknown. In this study, we characterize the first functional CMP-sialic acid synthase (DmCSAS) from any protostome lineage expressed from a D. melanogaster cDNA clone. Homologous genes were subsequently identified in other insect species. The gene is developmentally regulated, with expression first appearing at 12-24 h of embryogenesis, low expression through larval and pupal stages, and greatly enriched expression in the adult head, suggesting a possible role in the central nervous system. Activity of the enzyme was verified by an increase in in vitro and in vivo CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid levels when expressed in a heterologous host. Unlike all known vertebrate CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSAS) proteins that localize to the nucleus, the D. melanogaster CSAS protein was targeted to the Golgi compartment when expressed in both heterologous mammalian and insect cell lines. Replacement of the N-terminal leader sequence of DmCSAS with the human CSAS N-terminal sequence resulted in the redirection of the chimeric CSAS protein to the nucleus but with a concomitant loss of enzymatic activity.

The actions of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on cholinergic neurons of Drosophila melanogaster,16453147,10.1007/s10158-005-0013-8,"The neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid is an agonist on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We utilised fura-2-based calcium imaging to investigate the actions of imidacloprid on cultured GFP-tagged cholinergic neurons from the third instar larvae of the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster. We demonstrate dose-dependent increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in cholinergic neurons upon application of imidacloprid (10 nM-100 muM) that are blocked by nAChR antagonists mecamylamine (10 microM) and alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX, 1 microM). When compared to other (untagged) neurons, cholinergic neurons respond to lower concentrations of imidacloprid (10-100 nM) and exhibit larger amplitude responses to higher (1-100 microM) concentrations of imidacloprid. Although imidacloprid acts via nAChRs, increases in [Ca2+]i also involve voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in both groups of neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that cholinergic neurons express nAChRs that are highly sensitive to imidacloprid, and demonstrate a role for VGCCs in amplifying imidacloprid-induced increases in [Ca2+]i.",2006,"James E C Jepson, Laurence A Brown, David B Sattelle, James E C Jepson, Laurence A Brown, David B Sattelle"
Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 deficiency in Drosophila melanogaster causes accumulation of abnormal storage material and reduced life span,16452138,10.1534/genetics.105.053306,"Human neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive death of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and accumulation of abnormal lysosomal storage material. Infantile NCL (INCL), the most severe form of NCL, is caused by mutations in the Ppt1 gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (Ppt1). We generated mutations in the Ppt1 ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster to characterize phenotypes caused by Ppt1 deficiency in flies. Ppt1-deficient flies accumulate abnormal autofluorescent storage material predominantly in the adult CNS and have a life span 30% shorter than wild type, phenotypes that generally recapitulate disease-associated phenotypes common to all forms of NCL. In contrast, some phenotypes of Ppt1-deficient flies differed from those observed in human INCL. Storage material in flies appeared as highly laminar spherical deposits in cells of the brain and as curvilinear profiles in cells of the thoracic ganglion. This contrasts with the granular deposits characteristic of human INCL. In addition, the reduced life span of Ppt1-deficient flies is not caused by progressive death of CNS neurons. No changes in brain morphology or increases in apoptotic cell death of CNS neurons were detected in Ppt1-deficient flies, even at advanced ages. Thus, Ppt1-deficient flies accumulate abnormal storage material and have a shortened life span without evidence of concomitant neurodegeneration.",2006,"Anthony J Hickey, Heather L Chotkowski, Navjot Singh, Jeffrey G Ault, Christopher A Korey, Marcy E MacDonald, Robert L Glaser, Anthony J Hickey, Heather L Chotkowski, Navjot Singh, Jeffrey G Ault, Christopher A Korey, Marcy E MacDonald, Robert L Glaser"

      Acetylcholinesterase is irreversibly inhibited by organophosphate and carbamate insecticides allowing its use in biosensors for detection of these insecticides. Drosophila acetylcholinesterase is the most sensitive enzyme known and has been improved by in vitro mutagenesis. However, its stability has to be improved for extensive utilization.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To create a disulfide bond that could increase the stability of the Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase, we selected seven positions taking into account first the distance between Cbeta of two residues, in which newly introduced cysteines will form the new disulfide bond and second the conservation of the residues in the cholinesterase family. Most disulfide bonds tested did not increase and even decreased the stability of the protein. However, one engineered disulfide bridge, I327C/D375C showed significant stability increase toward denaturation by temperature (170 fold at 50 degrees C), urea, organic solvent and provided resistance to protease degradation. The new disulfide bridge links the N-terminal domain (first 356 aa) to the C-terminal domain. The quantities produced by this mutant were the same as in wild-type flies.

Furthermore we show that inbreeding and temperature stress cause increased between-line variance in gene expression patterns. We conclude that inbreeding and environmental stress both independently and synergistically affect gene expression patterns. Interactions between inbreeding and the environment are often observed at the phenotypic level and our results reveal some of the genes that are involved at the individual gene level.

Clip domains represent the most abundant non-catalytic structural units in these SP-like proteins -12 SPs and six SPHs contain at least one clip domain. Some of the family members contain other modules for protein-protein interactions, including disulphide-stabilized structures (LDL(r)A, SRCR, frizzled, kringle, Sushi, Wonton and Pan/apple), carbohydrate-recognition domains (C-type lectin and chitin-binding), and other modules (such as zinc finger, CUB, coiled coil and Sina). Comparison of the sequences with those from Drosophila led to a proposed SP pathway for establishing the dorsoventral axis of honey bee embryos. Multiple sequence alignments revealed evolutionary relationships of honey bee SPs and SPHs with those in Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, and Manduca sexta.

Changes in dopamine levels and locomotor activity in response to selection on virgin lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster,16620916,10.1016/j.mad.2006.02.004,"Among various other mechanisms, genetic differences in the production of reactive oxygen species are thought to underlie genetic variation for longevity. Here we report on possible changes in ROS production related processes in response to selection for divergent virgin lifespan in Drosophila. The selection lines were observed to differ significantly in dopamine levels and melanin pigmentation, which is associated with dopamine levels at eclosion. These findings confirm that variation in dopamine levels is associated with genetic variation for longevity. Dopamine has previously been implied in ROS production and in the occurrence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we propose a possible proximate mechanism by which dopamine levels affect longevity in Drosophila: We tested if increased dopamine levels were associated with a ""rate-of-living"" syndrome of increased activity and respiration levels, thus aggravating the level of oxidative stress. Findings on locomotor activity and oxygen consumption of short-lived flies were in line with expectations. However, the relation is not straightforward, as flies of the long-lived lines did not show any consistent differences in pigmentation or dopamine levels with respect to the control lines. Moreover, long-lived flies also had increased locomotor activity, but showed no consistent differences in respiration rate. This strongly suggests that the response for increased and decreased lifespan may be obtained by different mechanisms.",2006,"C J Vermeulen, T I F H Cremers, B H C Westerink, L Van De Zande, R Bijlsma, C J Vermeulen, T I F H Cremers, B H C Westerink, L Van De Zande, R Bijlsma"
Dosage compensation of the active X chromosome in mammals,16341221,10.1038/ng1705,"Monosomy of the X chromosome owing to divergence between the sex chromosomes leads to dosage compensation mechanisms to restore balanced expression between the X and the autosomes. In Drosophila melanogaster, upregulation of the male X leads to dosage compensation. It has been hypothesized that mammals likewise upregulate their active X chromosome. Together with X inactivation, this mechanism would maintain balanced expression between the X chromosome and autosomes and between the sexes. Here, we show that doubling of the global expression level of the X chromosome leads to dosage compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues, consistent with a role in cognitive functions. Furthermore, the X chromosome is expressed but not upregulated in spermatids and secondary oocytes, preserving balanced expression of the genome in these haploid cells. Upon fertilization, upregulation of the active X must occur to achieve the observed dosage compensation in early embryos.",2006,"Di Kim Nguyen, Christine M Disteche, Di Kim Nguyen, Christine M Disteche"
The RNA silencing endonuclease Argonaute 2 mediates specific antiviral immunity in Drosophila melanogaster,17079687,10.1101/gad.1482006,"Most organisms have evolved defense mechanisms to protect themselves from viruses and other pathogens. Arthropods lack the protein-based adaptive immune response found in vertebrates. Here we show that the central catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the nuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago-2), is essential for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila melanogaster. Ago-2-defective flies are hypersensitive to infection with a major fruit fly pathogen, Drosophila C virus (DCV), and with Cricket Paralysis virus (CrPV). Increased mortality in ago-2 mutant flies was associated with a dramatic increase in viral RNA accumulation and virus titers. The physiological significance of this antiviral mechanism is underscored by our finding that DCV encodes a potent suppressor of RNA interference (RNAi). This suppressor binds long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and inhibits Dicer-2-mediated processing of dsRNA into short interfering RNA (siRNA), but does not bind short siRNAs or disrupt the microRNA (miRNA) pathway.

In this article, large data sets of noncoding DNA sequence polymorphism in D. melanogaster and D. simulans were gathered from public databases to try to disentangle these two factors-noncoding sequences are not affected by selection for codon usage. Allele frequency analyses revealed an asymmetric pattern of AT vs. GC noncoding polymorphisms: AT --> GC mutations are less numerous, and tend to segregate at a higher frequency, than GC --> AT ones, especially at GC-rich loci. This is indicative of nonstationary evolution of base composition and/or of GC-biased allele transmission. Fitting population genetics models to the allele frequency spectra confirmed this result and favored the hypothesis of a biased transmission. These results, together with previous reports, suggest that GC-biased gene conversion has influenced base composition evolution in Drosophila and explain the correlation between intron and exon GC content.",2006,"Nicolas Galtier, Eric Bazin, Nicolas Bierne, Nicolas Galtier, Eric Bazin, Nicolas Bierne"

Rates and patterns of chromosomal evolution in Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. miranda,16547107,10.1534/genetics.105.054585,"Comparisons of gene orders between species permit estimation of the rate of chromosomal evolution since their divergence from a common ancestor. We have compared gene orders on three chromosomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura with its close relative, D. miranda, and the distant outgroup species, D. melanogaster, by using the public genome sequences of D. pseudoobscura and D. melanogaster and approximately 50 in situ hybridizations of gene probes in D. miranda. We find no evidence for extensive transfer of genes among chromosomes in D. miranda. The rates of chromosomal rearrangements between D. miranda and D. pseudoobscura are far higher than those found before in Drosophila and approach those for nematodes, the fastest rates among higher eukaryotes. In addition, we find that the D. pseudoobscura chromosome with the highest level of inversion polymorphism (Muller's element C) does not show an unusually fast rate of evolution with respect to chromosome structure, suggesting that this classic case of inversion polymorphism reflects selection rather than mutational processes. On the basis of our results, we propose possible ancestral arrangements for the D. pseudoobscura C chromosome, which are different from those in the current literature. We also describe a new method for correcting for rearrangements that are not detected with a limited set of markers.",2006,"Carolina BartolomÃ©, Brian Charlesworth, Carolina BartolomÃ©, Brian Charlesworth"

Binding of doa kinase to specific loci in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,16964964,,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Highly conserved LAMMER kinases belong to the family of dual-specific proteins phosphorylating enzymes with homologues in yeast, plants, Drosophila and mammals. SR proteins, several members of which are components of the spliceosomal complex and have been implicated in the control of alternative splicing, were identified among first targets of LAMMER kinases. The Drosophila locus Darkener of apricot (Doa) encodes best known representative of the LAMMER family of kinases, which is essential for embryonic and postembryonic development, neurogenesis, differentiation of photoreceptors, and sex determination.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      DOA kinase was detected on squash preparations of polythene chromosomes using anti-DOA antibodies in combination with indirect immunofluorescence.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we provide evidence for active chromosomal presence of DOA kinase in Drosophila salivary glands, and increased abundance of DOA at eleven specific loci of polythene chromosomes where it can be involved in on-site control of splicing process. Many genes that may be found at the loci with increased abundance fall into three major groups based on their known functions. First group contains genes that code for transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins or chromatin modifying enzymes. Second group of genes encode proteins which belong to proteasomal components, lipid enzymes, stress-sensitive ER proteins and caspases which are all early/proximal components of apoptotic process. Third group of genes comprises of tRNA coding genes or genes of tRNA synthases (ligases), all involved in protein synthesis. Some of the encoded protein products are confirmed or potential substrates of DOA kinase activity.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Data indicate that genes encoding proteins involved in closely related pathways are concentrated at certain loci to achieve more efficient regulation of their expression as exemplified from distribution of DOA protein on Drosophila polythene chromosomes.",2006,"Michaela KovÃ¡cikovÃ¡, Ivan Raska, Anton MateÃ¡sik, Bruce A Chase, Robert Farkas, Michaela KovÃ¡cikovÃ¡, Ivan Raska, Anton MateÃ¡sik, Bruce A Chase, Robert Farkas"
Identification and characterisation of the dopamine receptor II from the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis (CfDopRII),17027841,10.1016/j.ibmb.2006.07.003,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a protein family with a wide range of functions. Approximately 30% of human drug targets are GPCRs, illustrating their pharmaceutical relevance. In contrast, the knowledge about invertebrate GPCRs is limited and is mainly restricted to model organisms like Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Especially in ectoparasites like ticks and fleas, only few GPCRs are characterised. From the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis, a relevant parasite of cats and dogs, no GPCRs are known so far. Thus, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of available insect GPCR sequences from the honeybee Apis mellifera, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and genomic sequences from insect species. Aim of this analysis was the identification of highly conserved GPCRs in order to clone orthologs of these candidates from Ctenocephalides felis. It was found that the dopamine receptor family revealed highest conservation levels and thus was chosen for further characterisation.

A Drosophila model for age-associated changes in sleep:wake cycles,16938867,10.1073/pnas.0605903103,"One of the most consistent behavioral changes that occurs with age in humans is the loss of sleep consolidation. This can be quite disruptive and yet little is known about its underlying basis. To better understand the effects of aging on sleep:wake cycles, we sought to study this problem in Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful system for research on aging and behavior. By assaying flies of different ages as well as monitoring individual flies constantly over the course of their lifetime, we found that the strength of sleep:wake cycles decreased and that sleep became more fragmented with age in Drosophila. These changes in sleep:wake cycles became faster or slower with manipulations of ambient temperature that decreased or increased lifespan, respectively, demonstrating that they are a function of physiological rather than chronological age. The effect of temperature on lifespan was not mediated by changes in overall activity level or sleep amount. Flies treated with the oxidative stress-producing reagent paraquat showed a breakdown of sleep:wake cycles similar to that seen with aging, leading us to propose that the accumulation of oxidative damage with age contributes to the changes in rhythm and sleep. Together, these findings establish Drosophila as a valuable model for studying age-associated sleep fragmentation and breakdown of rhythm strength, and indicate that these changes in sleep:wake cycles are an integral part of the physiological aging process.",2006,"Kyunghee Koh, Joshua M Evans, Joan C Hendricks, Amita Sehgal, Kyunghee Koh, Joshua M Evans, Joan C Hendricks, Amita Sehgal"

Functional constraint underlies 60 million year stasis of Dipteran testis-specific beta-tubulin,16409380,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.05072.x,"How do proteins evolve while maintaining their function? Previous studies find a highly stringent structure/function relationship between the Drosophila melanogaster testis-specific tubulin beta2 and the spermtail axoneme, such that small changes in the beta2 protein render it unable to generate a motile axoneme. This raises the question, how does beta2 evolve while maintaining its function? To address this question we cloned full- and partial-length beta2 sequences from 17 species of Drosophila and Hirtodrosophila flies spanning 60 Myr of evolution. Not a single amino acid difference is coded among them-beta2 maintains its function by not evolving. We also performed gene genealogical analyses to determine ortholog/paralog relationships among insect tubulins. We find that the Lepidopteran and Dipteran testis-specific beta-tubulins are likely orthologs, and surprisingly, despite functioning in the same structure, the Lepidopteran orthologs are evolving rapidly. We argue that differences in tubulin isoform use in the testes cause the Dipteran axoneme to be less evolvable than the Lepidopteran axoneme, which has facilitated the evolution of a unique amino acid synergism in Drosophila and Hirtodrosophilabeta2 that is resistant to change, contributing to its evolutionary stasis.",2006,"Mark G Nielsen, Justin M Caserta, Sarah J Kidd, Christopher M Phillips, Mark G Nielsen, Justin M Caserta, Sarah J Kidd, Christopher M Phillips"
Use of time-lapse imaging and dominant negative receptors to dissect the steroid receptor control of neuronal remodeling in Drosophila,16354717,10.1242/dev.02191,"During metamorphosis, the reorganization of the nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster proceeds in part through remodeling of larval neurons. In this study, we used in-vitro imaging techniques and immunocytochemistry to track the remodeling of the thoracic ventral neurosecretory cells. Axons of these neurons prune their larval arbors early in metamorphosis and a larger, more extensive adult arbor is established via branch outgrowth. Expression of EcR dominant negative constructs and an EcR inverted repeat construct resulted in pruning defects of larval axon arbors and a lack of filopodia during pruning, but showed variable effects on outgrowth depending on the construct expressed. Cells expressing either UAS-EcR-B1(W650A) or UAS-EcR-A(W650A) lacked filopodia during the outgrowth period and formed a poorly branched, larval-like arbor in the adult. Cells expressing UAS-EcR-B1(F645A), UAS-EcR-B2(W650A) or UAS-IR-EcR (core) showed moderate filopodial activity and normal, albeit reduced, adult-like branching during outgrowth. These results are consistent with the role of activation versus derepression via EcR for successive phases of neuronal remodeling and suggest that functional ecdysone receptor is necessary for some, but not all, remodeling events.",2006,"Heather L D Brown, Lucy Cherbas, Peter Cherbas, James W Truman, Heather L D Brown, Lucy Cherbas, Peter Cherbas, James W Truman"

[Fertility of Drosophila melanogaster females affected by mutation l(2)M167DTS],16523657,,"We studied the fertility of D. melanogaster females heterozygous for the dominant temperature sensitive mutation l(2)M167DTS, which exerts a recessive lethal effect at 25 degrees C, under the conditions of stable temperature regimes 25, 28, and 29 degrees C and changing regimes 25-->29 degrees C and 29-->25 degrees C. It was shown that inhibition of total activity of oogenesis due to a decreased number of functioning ovarioles is one of the mechanisms underlying the decreased fertility of l(2)M167DTS /+ females. Analysis of individual fertility of each female confirmed also the role of sterility as a component of fertility of the females. Sterilization was realized due both to full depletion of functioning ovarioles and disturbed mechanism of laying the mature eggs onto a substrate as a result of violation of the feedback blocking normal ovulation, which led to the breakdown of ovarioles and filling of the abdominal cavity with mature oocytes. A significant polymorphism of heterozygous females by their fertility was observed. The intensity of sterilization and mortality of l(2)M167DTS/+ females sharply increased at an elevated temperature (29 degrees C), especially at the pupal stage.",2006,"A M Kulikov, E N Miasniankina, A M Kulikov, E N Miasniankina"
Interspecific and intraspecific comparisons of the period locus in the Drosophila willistoni sibling species,9214747,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025814,"The period (per) locus has received much attention in molecular evolution studies because it is one of the best studied ""behavioral genes"" and because it offers insight into the evolution of repetitive sequences. We studied most of the coding region of per in Drosophila willistoni and confirmed previously observed patterns of conservation and divergence among distantly related species. Five regions are so highly diverged that they cannot be aligned, whereas a region encompassing the PAS domain is very conserved. Structural and nucleotide polymorphism patterns in the willistoni group are not the same as those observed in previously studied species. We sequenced the region homologous to the highly polymorphic threonine-glycine repeat of D. melanogaster in multiple strains of D. willistoni, as well as in other members of willistoni group, and found an unusual amount of conservation in this region. However, the next nonconserved region downstream in the sequence is quite variable and polymorphic for the number of repeated glycines. The glycine codon usage is significantly different in this glycine repeat as compared to other parts of the gene. We were able to plot the directionality of change in the glycine repeat region onto a phylogeny and find that the addition of glycines is the general trend with the diversification of the willistoni group.",1997,"J M Gleason, J R Powell, J M Gleason, J R Powell"
Divergent and conserved features in the spatial expression of the Drosophila pseudoobscura esterase-5B gene and the esterase-6 gene of Drosophila melanogaster,9223257,10.1073/pnas.94.15.7735,"The regulatory regions of homologous genes encoding esterase 6 (Est-6) of Drosophila melanogaster and esterase 5B (Est-5B) of Drosophila pseudoobscura show very little similarity. We have undertaken a comparative study of the pattern of expression directed by the Est-5B and Est-6 5'-flanking DNA to attempt to reveal conserved elements regulating tissue-specific expression in adults. Esterase regulatory sequences were linked to a lacZ reporter gene and transformed into D. melanogaster embryos. Est-5B, 5' upstream elements, give rise to a beta-galactosidase expression pattern that coincides with the wild-type expression of Est-5B in D. pseudoobscura. The expression patterns of the Est-5B/lacZ construct are different from those of a fusion gene containing the upstream region of Est-6. Common sites of expression for both kinds of constructs are the third segment of antenna, the maxillary palps, and salivary glands. In vitro deletion mutagenesis has shown that the two genes have a different organization of regulatory elements controlling expression in both the third segment of antenna and maxillary palps. The results suggest that the conservation of the expression pattern in genes that evolved from a common ancestor may not be accompanied by preservation of the corresponding cis-regulatory elements.",1997,"N A Tamarina, M Z Ludwig, R C Richmond, N A Tamarina, M Z Ludwig, R C Richmond"
Conserved and sexually dimorphic behavioral responses to biogenic amines in decapitated Drosophila,9108117,10.1073/pnas.94.8.4131,"A preparation of decapitated Drosophila melanogaster has been used for direct application of drugs to the nerve cord. Serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine stimulate locomotion and grooming, showing distinguishable effects that often are potentiated by addition of the vertebrate monoamine oxidase-inhibitor hydrazaline. Many of the hydrazaline-induced effects are sexually dimorphic, with males showing greater responses than females. Behaviors similar to those induced by dopamine can be induced by application of the vertebrate dopamine D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole, whose effects are also sexually dimorphic. In contrast, vertebrate D2-like and D1-like dopamine antagonists result in akinesic states, and D1-like agonists selectively stimulate grooming. These data indicate that Drosophila nerve cord amine receptors are coupled to reflexive behaviors similar to those stimulated by brain dopamine receptors in vertebrates.",1997,"C Yellman, H Tao, B He, J Hirsh, C Yellman, H Tao, B He, J Hirsh"

In addition, the 5'-flanking region of the gene contains several common DNA sequences present in Drosophila TBP and TFIIS genes, suggesting the common regulation mechanism of gene expression. RNA blot analysis revealed that the gene expresses 1.6 kb, 1.3 kb and 1.2 kb mRNAs throughout development and in adults. Deletion analysis of the promoter region shows that the minimal promoter necessary for efficient expression is located between -698 (PstI) and +60 relative to the transcription start point.

drICE is an essential caspase required for apoptotic activity in Drosophila cells,9321398,10.1093/emboj/16.20.6192,"Caspases are involved in the execution of cell death in all multicellular organisms so far studied, including the nematode worm, fruit fly and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans has only a single identified caspase, CED-3, whose activity is absolutely required for all developmental programmed cell deaths, most mammalian cell types express multiple caspases with varying specificities. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is genetically tractable, less complex than vertebrates and possesses two known caspases, DCP-1 and drICE. The fly may therefore provide a good model system for examining the hierarchy and relative roles of individual caspases in the execution of apoptosis. We have examined the role of drICE in in vitro apoptosis of the D.melanogaster cell line S2. We show that cytoplasmic lysates made from S2 cells undergoing apoptosis induced by either reaper (rpr) expression or cycloheximide treatment contain a caspase activity with DEVD specificity which can cleave p35, lamin DmO, drICE and DCP-1 in vitro, and which can trigger chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei. Using antibodies specific to drICE, we show that immunodepletion of drICE from these lysates is sufficient to remove most measurable in vitro apoptotic activity, and that re-addition of exogenous drICE to such immunodepleted lysates restores apoptotic activity. We conclude that, at least in S2 cells, drICE can be the sole caspase effector of apoptosis.",1997,"A G Fraser, N J McCarthy, G I Evan, A G Fraser, N J McCarthy, G I Evan"
The congested-like tracheae gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a member of the mitochondrial carrier family required for gas-filling of the tracheal system and expansion of the wings after eclosion,9409834,,"A recessive semi-lethal mutation resulting from the insertion of a P-lacW transposon at the cytological position 23A on the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster was found to affect the unfolding and expansion of the wings resulting in a loss of venation and a marked decrease in their size. Lethality was polyphasic with numerous animals dying during early larval development and displaying apparently collapsed tracheal trees. The gene was therefore designated as congested-like tracheae, or colt. The colt mutation resulted from the insertion of a P-lacW transposon within the coding region of a 1.4-kb transcript. Wild-type function was restored by inducing a precise excision of the P-lacW transposon, while a deletion of the colt locus, produced by imprecise excision of the P element, showed a phenotype similar to that of the original P insert. The colt gene consists of a single exon and encodes a protein of 306 amino acids made of three tandem repeats, each characterized by two predicted transmembrane segments and a loop domain. The COLT protein shares extensive homology with proteins in the mitochondrial carrier family and particularly with the DIF-1 protein of Caenorhabditis elegans, which has been shown to be maternally required for embryonic tissue differentiation. Our analysis revealed that zygotic colt function is dispensable for normal embryonic morphogenesis but is required for gas-filling of the tracheal system at hatching time of the embryo and for normal epithelial morphogenesis of the wings.",1997,"K Hartenstein, P Sinha, A Mishra, H Schenkel, I TÃ¶rÃ¶k, B M Mechler, K Hartenstein, P Sinha, A Mishra, H Schenkel, I TÃ¶rÃ¶k, B M Mechler"

For each set of mtDNA combination, the modes of temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA differed according to the nuclear genome used. From these and our previous results (Matsuura et al., 1991; Tsujimoto et al., 1991), it is clear that the temperature-dependent transmission of mtDNA is affected by nuclear genome.

Incorporation of fatty acids into cuticular hydrocarbons of male and female Drosophila melanogaster,12770483,10.1016/s0022-1910(97)00082-6,"The biosynthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons was investigated in male and female Drosophila melanogaster (Canton-S strain), especially in those with a pheromonal role i.e. male 7-tricosene and female 7, 11- heptacosadiene. The incorporation of radioactivity was followed after topical application of (14)C-labelled myristic, palmitic and stearic acid and (3)H-labelled cis-vaccenic acid on one to ten day old flies. The incorporation levels into unsaturated hydrocarbons are similar in both sexes, depending markedly on the chain length of the saturated precursor, with a maximum level from myristic acid. Cis-vaccenic acid leads only to unsaturated compounds. With this precursor, there is an enhanced incorporation into female monoenes and dienes, maximum in two to three day old females. The total fatty acid composition shows the highest abundance of fatty acids with 16 carbon atoms and the presence of a major position for double bond, Delta9. Moreover, cis-vaccenic acid and 17-tetracosenoic acid are identified by GC-MS analysis. These data support an elongation-decarboxylation mechanism for the biosynthesis of D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbons. Its early steps for male monoenes and female monoenes and dienes might involve a Delta9 desaturase transforming palmitic acid into palmitoleic acid which would then be elongated into vaccenic acid, an important common precursor for all pheromones.",1997,"J -M.

By crossing a UAS-lacZ fusion gene as a reporter into these lines, we analysed the expression patterns of beta-galactosidase during oogenesis. Since there is no expression of GAL4 in the germ-line in these experiments, this is an ideal system for the analysis of expression patterns in sub-sets of follicle cells. These lines provide ideal markers for sets of follicle cells, e.g. anterior or posterior polar cells for studying genetic interactions in oogenesis; however, they can also be used in the same way as conventional enhancer traps to clone nearby genes with similar expression patterns. The advantages of this dual gal4/UAS system over conventional enhancer trapping includes the possibility of GAL4-directed misexpression and antisense expression studies to establish the function of the genes we identified during follicle cell determination and differentiation. These studies could lead to the isolation of homologous genes crucial in mammalian oogenesis.

The close proximity to the outgrowing axons suggests that the structures at the brain-foregut interface may play a role in the morphogenesis of embryonic brain tracts in Drosophila.",1997,"Britt Wildemann, Heinrich Reichert, G Bicker, Britt Wildemann, Heinrich Reichert, G Bicker"
"Mitotic phosphoepitopes are expressed in Kc cells, neuroblasts and isolated chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster",9378750,,"The progression of cells from metaphase to anaphase is thought to be regulated by a checkpoint that delays entry into anaphase until all chromosomes reach a stable bi-polar attachment at the metaphase plate. Previous work has suggested that the 3F3/2 kinetochore phosphoepitopes are involved in this checkpoint system. We show that the 3F3/2 centromere phosphoepitopes are present in Kc cells, third instar larval neuroblasts and isolated chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. In tissue culture cells and neuroblasts isolated from third instar larvae, centromere labelling is detected from early prophase to the metaphase-anaphase transition but absent once cells center anaphase. During anaphase, the antibody stains the spindle mid zone and during telophase the midbody is labelled until cells separate. In both cell types, the 3F3/2 antibody stains the centrosome from prophase to late telophase. The 3F3/2 staining is retained in Kc cells and third instar larval neuroblasts arrested at the prometaphase state with microtubule inhibitors. Also, two mitotic mutants that show abnormal spindle morphology retain the centromere labelling in a metaphase-like configuration, suggesting that they activate the metaphase-anaphase checkpoint. Finally, mitotic chromosomes isolated in the presence of a phosphatase inhibitor show phosphoepitopes at the primary constriction on the surface of each chromatid, however, chromosomes isolated in the absence of a phosphatase inhibitor do not. Incubation of these chromosomes with ATP causes the rephosphorylation of the phosphoepitopes at the centromere.",1997,"H Bousbaa, L Correia, G J Gorbsky, C E Sunkel, H Bousbaa, L Correia, G J Gorbsky, C E Sunkel"

Characterization of the EstP protein in Drosophila melanogaster and its conservation in drosophilids,9435945,10.1023/a:1021897016276,"The beta-esterase cluster of D. melanogaster comprises two tandemly duplicated genes. Est6 encodes the well-characterized 5' gene, but the product of the second gene, denoted EstP, had not previously been identified. Here we show that the EstP gene encodes the carboxylesterase EST7. Expression of EstP using the Baculovirus system led to production of a carboxylesterase biochemically indistinguishable from EST7. Furthermore, a naturally occurring EstP variant produces greatly reduced amounts of EstP mRNA and no detectable EST7 protein. Finally, introduction of a wild-type copy of EstP by germline transformation into the variant strain confers the wild-type EST7 phenotype. We show that EST7 differs from EST6 in its substrate and inhibitor specificities and tissue distribution. Germline transformation experiments show that EstP expression is controlled by sequences located between 192 bp 5' and 609 bp 3' of the EstP coding region. Data comparisons with other drosophilid esterases suggest that the site of expression and hence the function, of EST7 has been conserved across lineages in both the subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora.",1997,"M M Dumancic, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy, M M Dumancic, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy"

Two experimental populations were kept for 30 generations under relaxed natural selection. Each generation, 100 pairs were formed randomly, and every fecund pair contributed a son and a daughter to the next generation. Comparison with two controls, one cryopreserved and the other kept as the experimental populations but with long generation time, showed that the number of surviving offspring per female declined by 0.2% and 2.0% per generation under benign and harsh, competitive conditions, respectively.

The homologous human FLII gene encodes a 1269-residue protein with 58% amino acid sequence identity and is deleted in Smith-Magenis syndrome. We have cloned the FLII gene and determined its nucleotide sequence (14.1 kb). FLII has 29 introns, compared with 13 in Caenorhabditis elegans and 3 in D. melanogaster. The positions of several introns are conserved in FLII-related genes and in the domains and subdomains of the gelsolin-like regions giving indications of gelsolin gene family evolution. In keeping with its function in indirect flight muscle in Drosophila, the human FLII gene was most highly expressed in muscle. The FLII gene lies adjacent to LLGL, the human homologue of the D. melanogaster tumor suppressor gene lethal(2) giant larvae.

In contrast to several mammalian MnSOD genes, the Drosophila gene contains a single intron and is transcribed into a single 0.8-kb transcript. Whole-mount in situ hybridization reveals extensive transcript accumulation in ovarian nurse cells and a heavy maternal contribution to the early embryo. Larval imaginal discs are enriched with MnSOD transcripts relative to other larval tissues, further suggesting a possible relationship between high MnSOD expression and mitotic activity. The 5'-upstream region contains several well-known regulatory elements including metal response, antioxidant response, and xenobiotic response elements (MRE, ARE, and XRE, respectively), sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate regulator binding element factor (CREB), as well as classic TATA and CAAT boxes.

Novel embryonic regulation of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel expression in Drosophila,9460238,10.1007/BF02211941,"The slowpoke gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel that is expressed in neurons, muscles, tracheal cells and the middle midgut. The entire transcriptional control region of slowpoke is contained in 11 kb of genomic DNA. Previous work has identified four different tissue-specific promoters (Promoters C1, C1b, C1c and C2) and sequences that regulate their activity. Here we describe and contrast the regulation of neuronal and muscle expression during embryogenesis with its regulation during larval and adult stages. Embryonic regulation is fundamentally different. The embryo uses Promoter C1 and a previously undescribed promoter, called Promoter Ce, to drive neuronal expression. The expression patterns of these promoters are distinct. Muscle expression arises from Promoter C2 as in other developmental stages. A downstream intronic region has been shown to contain control elements that modulate promoter activity differently in embryos, larvae and adults. Embryonic CNS expression is not dependent on the intron, however; its deletion has substantial effects on neuronal expression in larvae and adults. In embryonic muscle, removal of the intron eliminates muscle expression even though this deletion does not reduce larval muscle expression.",1997,"T Thomas, B Wang, R Brenner, N S Atkinson, T Thomas, B Wang, R Brenner, N S Atkinson"
Identification of a gene family from Drosophila melanogaster encoding proteins with homology to invertebrate sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins (SCPS),9443378,10.1016/s0965-1748(97)00062-3,"Using antibodies raised against the Drosophila Ca(2+)-binding protein DCABP-23, we have isolated two distinct cDNA clones that encode Ca(2+)-binding proteins of the invertebrate sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) family. Southern blot analysis of whole genomic DNA has shown that one of the clones, Dcabp-A.1, is present in more than one copy in the genome of the fly, and is located in the beta-heterochromatic region at cytological division 80 on chromosome III. The expression pattern of this transcript shows that it is present in the tubular but not the fibrillar muscles of the adult thorax. This expression pattern is consistent with this being a true SCP. In contrast, the expression pattern of the transcript corresponding to the second cDNA clone is exclusive to neural tissue. This transcript derives from a single copy gene, and is located at cytological position 89 D on chromosome III. Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences from the proteins encoded by the two cDNAs with that of the original DCABP-23 protein indicates that the purified DCABP-23 contained mainly the DCABP-A.1 protein.

A genetic system to detect mitotic recombination between repeated chromosomal sequences in Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells,9465910,10.1016/s1383-5718(97)00138-1,"In order to study mitotic homologous recombination in somatic Drosophila melanogaster cells in vitro and to learn more on the question how recombination is influenced by mutagens, a genetic system was developed where spontaneous and drug-induced recombination could be monitored. Two recombination reporter substrates were stably introduced in multiple copies into the genome of established D. melanogaster Schneider line 2 cells: one plasmid (pSB310) contained the 5' and 3' deleted neomycin phosphoribosyltransferase alleles neoL and neoR as direct repeats; the other (pSB485) contained similar deletions (lacZL and lacZR) of the beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ). Restoration of a functional neo gene upon mitotic recombination between homologous sequences allowed direct selection for the event, whereas recombination in single cells harbouring the integrated lacZ-based reporter plasmid was detected by histochemical staining or flow cytometric analysis (FACS). The neo-based construct in the clonal transgenic cell line 44CD4 showed a spontaneous recombination frequency of 2.9 x 10(-4), whereas the 485AD1 cell line harbouring the lacZ-based construct exhibited a frequency of 2.8 x 10(-4). The alkylating agents EMS and MMS and the clastogen mitomycin C were able to induce recombination in the 485AD1 cell line in a dose-dependent manner.

Lack of microheterogeneity did not significantly alter the frequency of exchange along the isogenic X chromosomes relative to controls or to previously reported values.

This sequence shows striking homology to some mammalian transcriptional enhancer elements, supporting a role for the su(Hw) protein in the control of gypsy transcription.

Membrane glycoproteins immunologically related to the human insulin receptor are associated with presumptive neuronal territories and developing neurones in Drosophila melanogaster,3143540,,"We have generated a monoclonal antibody (Mab E1C) that recognizes the differentiated nervous system in Drosophila embryos. At the cellular blastoderm stage, Mab E1C behaves as a general ectodermal marker but, in subsequent stages, it also labels the mesoderm. As neurogenesis takes place, staining increases within the neuromeres and is almost exclusively restricted to the nervous tissue by the time neuronal differentiation is completed. In third instar larvae, Mab E1C stains the central nervous system (CNS) as well as the imaginal discs which display a staining pattern related to their degree of neuronal differentiation. No labelling can be detected in adult brains or ovaries. Western blots are consistent with this developmental profile and allow the characterization of a major glycoprotein of 135 X 10(3) Mr (135K) which cosediments with a membrane fraction prepared from embryos. Additional glycoproteins (100K and 80K) are extracted from embryo homogenates by immunoaffinity procedures. In larvae, the 100K polypeptide is not detected. The properties of the 135K and 100K components are highly reminiscent of the molecular pattern of the Drosophila insulin receptor homologue (Petruzzelli et al. (1985) J. biol. Chem. 250, 16072-16075). It is shown that a Mab directed against the human insulin receptor stains the same cells as Mab E1C in imaginal discs and in the CNS. Moreover, this Mab cross-reacts with the 135K and 100K components of the embryonic antigen E1C.",1988,"M Piovant, P LÃ©na, M Piovant, P LÃ©na"

Variable splicing of non-coding roX2 RNAs influences targeting of MSL dosage compensation complexes in Drosophila,17114930,10.4161/rna.2.4.2473,"The non-coding roX1 and roX2 RNAs are components of the MSL dosage compensation complex in Drosophila. We found that multiple species of roX2 RNA are produced by alternative splicing, with one major and at least 20 different minor forms associated with MSL proteins. The alternative forms are generated by variable usage of multiple 5' and 3' splice sites between two common exons. This alternative splicing is evolutionarily conserved in several distant Drosophila species in spite of differences in primary sequences. Transgenic constructs expressing individual major or minor D. melanogaster roX2 species display low steady-state levels of roX2 RNA, weak accumulation of MSL complex on the X chromosome, and low rescue of male-specific roX(-) lethality. Increased expression of individual roX2 forms using the constitutive Hsp83 promoter results in increased transgenic rescue of roX(-) mutant male flies. However, although males survive they are delayed in their development. In addition, MSL complexes still show low affinity for the X chromosome and abnormal accumulation at the transgenic site of synthesis of the individual roX2 alternative splice form. Taken together, these results suggest an important role for roX2 RNA splicing in optimal MSL complex assembly or function.",2005,"Yongkyu Park, Hyangyee Oh, Victoria H Meller, Mitzi I Kuroda, Yongkyu Park, Hyangyee Oh, Victoria H Meller, Mitzi I Kuroda"
Wolbachia utilizes host microtubules and Dynein for anterior localization in the Drosophila oocyte,16228015,10.1371/journal.ppat.0010014,"To investigate the role of the host cytoskeleton in the maternal transmission of the endoparasitic bacteria Wolbachia, we have characterized their distribution in the female germ line of Drosophila melanogaster. In the germarium, Wolbachia are distributed to all germ cells of the cyst, establishing an early infection in the cell destined to become the oocyte. During mid-oogenesis, Wolbachia exhibit a distinct concentration between the anterior cortex and the nucleus in the oocyte, where many bacteria appear to contact the nuclear envelope. Following programmed rearrangement of the microtubule network, Wolbachia dissociate from this anterior position and become dispersed throughout the oocyte. This localization pattern is distinct from mitochondria and all known axis determinants. Manipulation of microtubules and cytoplasmic Dynein and Dynactin, but not Kinesin-1, disrupts anterior bacterial localization in the oocyte. In live egg chambers, Wolbachia exhibit movement in nurse cells but not in the oocyte, suggesting that the bacteria are anchored by host factors. In addition, we identify mid-oogenesis as a period in the life cycle of Wolbachia in which bacterial replication occurs. Total bacterial counts show that Wolbachia increase at a significantly higher rate in the oocyte than in the average nurse cell, and that normal Wolbachia levels in the oocyte depend on microtubules. These findings demonstrate that Wolbachia utilize the host microtubule network and associated proteins for their subcellular localization in the Drosophila oocyte. These interactions may also play a role in bacterial motility and replication, ultimately leading to the bacteria's efficient maternal transmission.",2005,"Patrick M Ferree, Horacio M Frydman, Jennifer M Li, Jian Cao, Eric Wieschaus, William Sullivan, Patrick M Ferree, Horacio M Frydman, Jennifer M Li, Jian Cao, Eric Wieschaus, William Sullivan"
Neurodegenerative mutants in Drosophila: a means to identify genes and mechanisms involved in human diseases?,16187075,10.1007/s10158-005-0005-8,"There are 50 ways to leave your lover (Simon 1987) but many more to kill your brain cells. Several neurodegenerative diseases in humans, like Alzheimer's disease, have been intensely studied but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown for most of them. For those syndromes where associated gene products have been identified their biochemistry and physiological as well as pathogenic function is often still under debate. This is in part due to the inherent limitations of genetic analyses in humans and other mammals and therefore experimentally accessible invertebrate in vivo models, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have recently been introduced to investigate neurodegenerative syndromes. Several laboratories have used transgenic approaches in Drosophila to study the human genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This has added substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative diseases in humans. The isolation and characterization of Drosophila mutants, which display a variety of neurodegenerative phenotypes, also provide valuable insights into genes, pathways, and mechanisms causing neurodegeneration. So far only about two dozen such mutants have been described but already their characterization reveals an involvement of various cellular functions in neurodegeneration, ranging from preventing oxidative stress to RNA editing. Some of the isolated genes can already be associated with human neurodegenerative diseases and hopefully the isolation and characterization of more of these mutants, together with an analysis of homologous genes in vertebrate models, will provide insights into the genetic and molecular basis of human neurodegenerative diseases.",2005,"Doris Kretzschmar, Doris Kretzschmar"
Is premating isolation in Drosophila overestimated due to uncontrolled factors?,16385158,10.1007/BF02715796,"Sexual isolation in Drosophila is typically measured by multiple-choice mating tests. While many environmental variables during such tests are controlled by the researcher, there are some factors that are usually uncontrolled. We demonstrate, using Drosophila melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura flies, that the temperature of rearing, pre-adult density, and level of consanguinity, can all produce differences in mating propensity between genetically equivalent flies. These differences in mating propensity, in turn, can give rise to statistically significant results in multiple-choice mating tests, leading to positive isolation values and the artifactual inference of sexual isolation between populations. This fact agrees with a nonrandom excess of significant positive tests found in a review of the literature of Drosophila intraspecific mating choice. An overestimate of true cases of sexual isolation in Drosophila in the literature can, therefore, not be ruled out.",2005,"Pelayo Casares, Rafael PiÃ±eiro, Maria C Carracedo, Pelayo Casares, Rafael PiÃ±eiro, Maria C Carracedo"
Compensatory cis-trans evolution and the dysregulation of gene expression in interspecific hybrids of Drosophila,16143608,10.1534/genetics.105.047449,"Hybrids between species are often characterized by novel gene-expression patterns. A recent study on allele-specific gene expression in hybrids between species of Drosophila revealed cases in which cis- and trans-regulatory elements within species had coevolved in such a way that changes in cis-regulatory elements are compensated by changes in trans-regulatory elements. We hypothesized that such coevolution should often lead to gene misexpression in the hybrid. To test this hypothesis, we estimated allele-specific expression and overall expression levels for 31 genes in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and their F1 hybrid. We found that 13 genes with cis-trans compensatory evolution are in fact misexpressed in the hybrid. These represent candidate genes whose dysregulation might be the consequence of coevolution of cis- and trans-regulatory elements within species. Using a mathematical model for the regulation of gene expression, we explored the conditions under which cis-trans compensatory evolution can lead to misexpression in interspecific hybrids.",2005,"Christian R Landry, Patricia J Wittkopp, Clifford H Taubes, Jose M Ranz, Andrew G Clark, Daniel L Hartl, Christian R Landry, Patricia J Wittkopp, Clifford H Taubes, Jose M Ranz, Andrew G Clark, Daniel L Hartl"
The relationship between life span and adult body size is highly strain-specific in Drosophila melanogaster,15919589,10.1016/j.exger.2005.02.004,"Among mammals, body size and life span tend to vary inversely within species, but the pattern is less clear in invertebrates. Here, we report on survival and weight of male flies from 29 laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Natural variation in body mass was enhanced by rearing larvae under normal and limited food conditions. Strain, weight, and larval treatment have significant effects on survival, but higher order interactions are also significant, indicating strain specificity. For pooled data the overall relationship between mass and life span is slight, positive, and statistically significant, but mass explains < or =1% of the variation in survival. This result is opposite to the common prediction of an inverse relationship between longevity and body size. Effects of artificially reduced body size vary substantially in both sign and magnitude from strain to strain, though long-lived strains generally retain their enhanced survival characteristics. Within-line regressions of life span on mass also vary dramatically from strain to strain; in Canton-S, the most extreme case, mass explains >40% of the variation in survival. For long-lived 'O' lines reared under normal larval conditions, smaller flies live 16% longer than larger flies; the latter are significantly underrepresented in the most advanced age class. We conclude that the body size-life span relationship is highly strain-specific; that inconsistencies in the literature probably reflect real biological variation; and that variation in body size can be a significant source of experimental noise in survival studies.",2005,"Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger, Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger"

The peaks of Dmjhe mRNA observed in the larvae coincided with the peaks of juvenile hormone (JH). In contrast, the mRNA for ecdysone-induced transcription factor, Drosophila hormone receptor 3 (DHR3) showed peaks of expression that coincided with the ecdysteroid peaks in embryo, larva and pupa. JH III induced Dmjhe mRNA but not DHR3 mRNA in explanted tissues cultured in Grace's medium. 20-hydroxyecdysone induced DHR3 mRNA and suppressed JH III induction of DmJhe mRNA.

Immunocytochemical analysis of putative allatostatin receptor (DAR-2) distribution in the CNS of larval Drosophila melanogaster,15626507,10.1016/j.peptides.2004.08.026,"Allatostatins (ASTs) are a family of neuropeptides that inhibit the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone in cockroaches and related insects, but not in flies. Two receptors for allatostatins, DAR-1 and DAR-2, with sequence similarity to mammalian galanin receptors have previously been cloned in Drosophila melanogaster. To study the distribution of the predicted DAR-2 protein by immunocytochemistry, antisera were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to part of the amino terminus of the receptor sequence. In the brain of larval Drosophila, immunoreactivity appeared to be associated with glial septa surrounding neuropil compartments. In the ventral ganglion, immunoreactive cell bodies appeared to reside in the cortex of the ganglion, surrounding the central neuropil and neurohemal organs. In addition, double labeling immunocytochemistry revealed a substantial superposition between distribution of AST-like immunoreactivity and the putative DAR-2 protein in at least five cell bodies in the region of the ring gland corresponding to the corpora cardiaca.",2005,"Paul R F Bowser, Stephen S Tobe, Paul R F Bowser, Stephen S Tobe"
Identification and partial characterization of the enzyme of omega: one of five putative DPP IV genes in Drosophila melanogaster,17119608,10.1093/jis/5.1.26,"The omega (ome) gene product is a modifier of larval cuticle protein 5 and its alleles (and duplicates) in the third instar of Drosophila melanogaster. Using deletion mapping the locus mapped to 70F-71A on the left arm of chromosome 3. A homozygote null mutant (ome 1) shows a pleiotropic phenotype that affected the size, developmental time of the flies, and the fertility (or perhaps the behavior) of homozygous mutant males. The omega gene was verified as producing a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) by genetic analysis, substrate specificity and pH optimum. The identity of the gene was confirmed as CG32145 (cytology 70F4) in the Celera Database (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project), which is consistent with its deletion map position. The genomic structure of the gene is described and the decrease in DPPIV activity in the mutant ome1 is shown to be due to the gene CG32145 (omega). The D. melanogaster omega DPPIV enzyme was partially purified and characterized.

Female receptivity in butterflies and moths,16155216,10.1242/jeb.01774,"Female receptivity in butterflies and moths is influenced by a multitude of factors that vary between virgin and mated females, and is often affected by the quality and persistence of courting males. Mated females of polyandrous species frequently display a period of non-receptivity following mating, often resulting from factors transferred by the male at mating. Some of these compounds have a transient effect (e.g. anti-aphrodisiacs and mating plugs), whereas others induce long-term suppression of receptivity (i.e. sperm and seminal factors). Sperm appear to generally induce long-term suppression of female receptivity in both butterflies and moths. In some species, production of non-fertile sperm may function to fill the female's sperm storage organ and switch off receptivity, although whether this is a general phenomenon across the Lepidoptera has not yet been examined. Examination of seminal fluids suppressing female receptivity in moths suggests that more than one factor is implicated, but frequently the transfer or stimulation of Juvenile Hormone production is involved. Surprisingly, potential seminal factors influencing female receptivity in butterflies remain largely unexplored. In this review, I summarize the various factors that are known to affect female receptivity in the Lepidoptera to date, and briefly compare the function and similarity of the Pheromone Suppressing Peptide (HezPSP) in moths to that of the Sex Peptide in Drosophila melanogaster (DrmSP). The exciting possibility that seminal peptides in the Lepidoptera and Diptera (e.g. Drosophila melanogaster) may have shared functionality is discussed.",2005,"Nina Wedell, Nina Wedell"

This has led to the development of animal models in which the pathogenesis caused by these genes can be rigorously examined. Due to their short life span and powerful genetic potential, several attempts have been made to model neurodegenerative diseases in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.

The investigation of 18 species (11 of which were being examined for the first time) belonging to the melanogaster and ananassae subgroups suggests that the ancestral configuration consists of one nucleolus organizer (NOR) on each sex chromosome. This pattern, which is conserved throughout the melanogaster subgroup, except in D. simulans and D. sechellia, was observed only in the ercepeae complex within the ananassae subgroup. Both sex-linked NORs must have been lost in the lineage leading to D. varians and in the ananassae and bipectinata complexes, whereas new sites, characterized by intra-species variation in hybridization signal size, appeared on the fourth chromosome related to heterochromatic rearrangements. Nucleolar material is thought to be required for sex chromosome pairing and disjunction in a variety of organisms including Drosophila. Thus, either remnant sequences, possibly intergenic spacer repeats, are still present in the sex chromosomes which have lost their NORs (as observed in D. simulans and D. sechellia), or an alternative mechanism has evolved.",2005,"V Roy, L Monti-Dedieu, N Chaminade, S Siljak-Yakovlev, S Aulard, F Lemeunier, C Montchamp-Moreau, V Roy, L Monti-Dedieu, N Chaminade, S Siljak-Yakovlev, S Aulard, F Lemeunier, C Montchamp-Moreau"

It controls and modulates neuronal development, circadian rhythm, locomotion, 'fight or flight' responses, as well as learning and memory. Octopamine mediates its effects by activation of different GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor types, which induce either cAMP production or Ca(2+) release. Here we describe the functional characterization of two genes from Drosophila melanogaster that encode three octopamine receptors. The first gene (Dmoa1) codes for two polypeptides that are generated by alternative splicing. When heterologously expressed, both receptors cause oscillatory increases of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in response to applying nanomolar concentrations of octopamine. The second gene (Dmoa2) codes for a receptor that specifically activates adenylate cyclase and causes a rise of intracellular cAMP with an EC(50) of approximately 3 x 10(-8) m octopamine. Tyramine, the precursor of octopamine biosynthesis, activates all three receptors at > or = 100-fold higher concentrations, whereas dopamine and serotonin are non-effective.

Genetic architecture of two fitness-related traits in Drosophila melanogaster: ovariole number and thorax length,16247693,10.1007/s10709-005-8549-4,"In Drosophila melanogaster, ovariole number and thorax length are morphological characters thought to be associated with fitness. Maximum daily egg production in females is positively correlated with ovariole number, while thorax length is correlated with male reproductive success and female fecundity. Though both traits are related to fitness, ovariole number is likely to be under stabilizing selection, while thorax length appears to be under directional selection. Current research has focused on examining the sources of variation for ovariole number in relation to fitness, with a view towards elucidating how segregating variation is maintained in natural populations. Here, we utilize a diallel design to explore the genetic architecture of ovariole number and thorax length in nine isogenic lines derived from a natural population. The full diallel design allows the estimation of general combining ability (GCA), specific combining ability (SCA), and also describes variation due to reciprocal effects (RGCA and RSCA). Ovariole number and thorax length differed with respect to their genetic architecture, reflective of the independent selective forces acting on the traits. For ovariole number, GCA accounted for the majority (67.3%) of variation segregating between the lines, with no evidence of reciprocal effects or inbreeding depression; SCA accounted for a small percentage (3.9%) of the variance, suggesting dominance variation; no reciprocal effects were observed. In contrast, for thorax length, the majority of the non-error variance was accounted for by SCA (17.9%), with only one third as much variance (6.2%) due to GCA. Interestingly, RSCA (nuclear-extranuclear interactions) accounted for slightly more variation (7.5%) than GCA in these data. Thus, genetic variation for thorax length is largely in accord with predictions for a fitness trait under directional selection: little additive genetic variation and substantial dominance variation (including a suggestion of inbreeding depression); while the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of variation for ovariole number are more complex.",2005,"M Telonis-Scott, L M McIntyre, M L Wayne, M Telonis-Scott, L M McIntyre, M L Wayne"
Integrin-independent repression of cadherin transcription by talin during axis formation in Drosophila,15852002,10.1038/ncb1253,"The Drosophila melanogaster anterior-posterior axis becomes polarized early during oogenesis by the posterior localization of the oocyte within the egg chamber. The invariant position of the oocyte is thought to be driven by an upregulation of the adhesion molecule DE-cadherin in the oocyte and the posterior somatic follicle cells, providing the first in vivo example of cell sorting that is specified by quantitative differences in cell-cell adhesion. However, it has remained unclear how DE-cadherin levels are regulated. Here, we show that talin, known for its role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, has the unexpected function of specifically inhibiting DE-cadherin transcription. Follicle cells that are mutant for talin show a strikingly high level of DE-cadherin, due to elevated transcription of DE-cadherin. We demonstrate that this deregulation of DE-cadherin is sufficient to attract the oocyte to lateral and anterior positions. Surprisingly, this function of talin is independent of integrins.

Sequence turnover and tandem repeats in cis-regulatory modules in drosophila,15659554,10.1093/molbev/msi090,"The path by which regulatory sequence can change, yet preserve function, is an important open question for both evolution and bioinformatics. The recent sequencing of two additional species of Drosophila plus the wealth of data on gene regulation in the fruit fly provides new means for addressing this question. For regulatory sequences, indels account for more base pairs (bp) of change than substitutions (between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba), though they are fewer in number. Using Drosophila pseudoobscura as an out-group, we can distinguish insertions from deletions (with maximum parsimony criteria), and find a ratio between 1 and 5 (insertions to deletions) that is species dependent and much larger than the ratio of 1/8 for neutral sequences (Petrov and Hartl 1998). Because neutral sequence is rapidly cleared from the genome, most noncoding regions which preserve their length between D. melanogaster-D. pseudoobscura and have an excess of insertions over deletions should be functional. A fraction of 15%-18% (i.e., more than 20 standard deviations from random expectation) of the regulatory sequence is covered by low copy number tandem repeats whose repeating unit has an average length of 5-10 bp and which occur preferentially (25%-45% coverage) in indels. All indels may be due to tandem repeats if we extrapolate the detection efficiency of the repeat-finding algorithms using the observed point mutation rate between the species we compare. Sequence creation by local duplication accords with the tendency for multiple copies of transcription factor-binding sites to occur in regulatory modules. Thus, indel events and tandem repeats in particular need to be incorporated into models of regulatory evolution because they can alter the rate at which beneficial variants arise and should also influence bioinformatic algorithms that parse regulatory sequences into binding sites.",2005,"Saurabh Sinha, Eric D Siggia, Saurabh Sinha, Eric D Siggia"

The second thoracic segment limb primordium gives rise to three structures: the wing imaginal disc, the leg imaginal disc, and a larval mechanosensory structure called Keilin's organ. We report that most of the limb primordium arises within neurogenic ectoderm and demonstrate that the neural and imaginal components of the primordium have distinct developmental potentials. We also provide the first analysis of the genetic pathways that subdivide the progenitor cell population into uniquely imaginal and neural identities. In particular, we demonstrate that the imaginal gene escargot represses Keilin's organ fate and that Keilin's organ is specified by Distal-less in conjunction with the downstream achaete-scute complex. This specification involves both the activation of the neural genes cut and couch potato and the repression of escargot. In the absence of achaete-scute complex function, cells adopt mixed identities and subsequently die. We propose that central cells of the primordium previously thought to contribute to the distal leg are Keilin's organ precursors, while both proximal and distal leg precursors are located more peripherally and within the escargot domain.",2005,"Reese A Bolinger, Grace Boekhoff-Falk, Reese A Bolinger, Grace Boekhoff-Falk"
The meiotic defects of mutants in the Drosophila mps1 gene reveal a critical role of Mps1 in the segregation of achiasmate homologs,15823541,10.1016/j.cub.2005.02.062,"The conserved kinase Mps1 is necessary for the proper functioning of the mitotic and meiotic spindle checkpoints (MSCs), which monitor the integrity of the spindle apparatus and prevent cells from progressing into anaphase until chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase plate. In Drosophila melanogaster, a null allele of the gene encoding Mps1 was recently shown to be required for the proper functioning of the MSC, but it did not appear to exhibit a defect in female meiosis. We demonstrate here that the meiotic mutant ald1 is a hypomorphic allele of the mps1 gene. Both ald1 and a P-insertion allele of mps1 exhibit defects in female meiotic chromosome segregation. The observed segregational defects are substantially more severe for pairs of achiasmate homologs, which are normally segregated by the achiasmate (or distributive) segregation system, than they are for chiasmate bivalents. Furthermore, cytological analysis of ald1 mutant oocytes reveals both a failure in the coorientation of achiasmate homologs at metaphase I and a defect in the maintenance of the chiasmate homolog associations that are normally observed at metaphase I. We conclude that Mps1 plays an important role in Drosophila female meiosis by regulating processes that are especially critical for ensuring the proper segregation of nonexchange chromosomes.",2005,"William D Gilliland, Sarah M Wayson, R Scott Hawley, William D Gilliland, Sarah M Wayson, R Scott Hawley"

Both traits exhibited significant genetic variation within collection sites and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, but not genetic variation for plasticity. Between-site genetic variation in ovariole number was negatively correlated with altitude on both slopes of the canyon, and collections from the north- and south-facing slopes were genetically differentiated for male, but not female, body size.

Evolutionary conservation of Ceratitis capitata transformer gene function,15998727,10.1534/genetics.105.041004,"Transformer functions as a binary switch gene in the sex determination and sexual differentiation of Drosophila melanogaster and Ceratitis capitata, two insect species that separated nearly 100 million years ago. The TRA protein is required for female differentiation of XX individuals, while XY individuals express smaller, presumably nonfunctional TRA peptides and consequently develop into adult males. In both species, tra confers female sexual identity through a well-conserved double-sex gene. However, unlike Drosophila tra, which is regulated by the upstream Sex-lethal gene, Ceratitis tra itself is likely to control a feedback loop that ensures the maintenance of the female sexual state. The putative CcTRA protein shares a very low degree of sequence identity with the TRA proteins from Drosophila species. However, in this study we show that a female-specific Ceratitis Cctra cDNA encoding the putative full-length CcTRA protein is able to support the female somatic and germline sexual differentiation of D. melanogaster XX; tra mutant adults. Although highly divergent, CcTRA can functionally substitute for DmTRA and induce the female-specific expression of both Dmdsx and Dmfru genes. These data demonstrate the unusual plasticity of the TRA protein that retains a conserved function despite the high evolutionary rate.

Synapcam localizes to the postsynaptic terminal and selectively reports Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptors (GluRs) with single-impulse and single-bouton resolution. GluR-based Ca2+ signals were uniform within a given connection (that is, a given bouton/postsynaptic terminal pair) but differed considerably among connections of an NMJ. A steep gradient of transmission strength was observed along axonal branches, from weak proximal connections to strong distal ones. Presynaptic imaging showed a matching axonal gradient, with higher Ca2+ influx and exocytosis at distal boutons.

Here we test whether this apparent cessation of reproductive aging by a population, herein referred to as fecundity plateaus, is robust under various environmental influences: namely, male age and nutrition. The effect of male age on late age fecundity patterns was tested by supplying older females with young males before average population fecundity declined to plateau levels. The second possible environmental influence we tested was nutrition and whether late-life fecundity plateaus arise from a decline in the calories available for reproduction. This hypothesis was tested by comparing average daily female fecundity with both low- and high-lifetime nutrition. Both hypotheses were tested by measuring mid- and late-life fecundity for each cohort under the various environmental influences, and statistically testing whether fecundity stops declining and plateaus at late ages. These experiments demonstrate that mid- and late-life population fecundity patterns are significantly affected by the age of males and nutrition level. However, male age and nutrition level did not affect the existence of late-life fecundity plateaus, which demonstrates the robustness of our earlier findings.

Possible problems with this approach are revealed by using a method for direct monitoring of D. melanogaster feeding behavior. This demonstrates that dietary restriction elicits robust compensatory changes in food consumption. As a result, the effect of medium dilution is overestimated and, in certain cases, even fully compensated for.

If substitutional processes across the genome are heterogeneous, then examining patterns of coding sequence evolution without taking these underlying variations into account may be misleading. Here we present the first rigorous test of substitution rate heterogeneity in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using almost 1500 nonfunctional fragments of the transposable element DNAREP1_DM. Not only do our analyses suggest that substitutional patterns in heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences are different, but also they provide support in favor of a recombination-associated substitutional bias toward G and C in this species. The magnitude of this bias is entirely sufficient to explain recombination-associated patterns of codon usage on the autosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. We also document a bias toward lower GC content in the pattern of small insertions and deletions (indels). In addition, the GC content of noncoding DNA in Drosophila is higher than would be predicted on the basis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions and small indels. However, we argue that the fast turnover of noncoding sequences in Drosophila makes it difficult to assess the importance of the GC biases in nucleotide substitutions and small indels in shaping the base composition of noncoding sequences.",2005,"Nadia D Singh, Peter F Arndt, Dmitri A Petrov, Nadia D Singh, Peter F Arndt, Dmitri A Petrov"
Control of lateral migration and germ cell elimination by the Drosophila melanogaster lipid phosphate phosphatases Wunen and Wunen 2,16301333,10.1083/jcb.200506038,"In most organisms, primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise far from the region where somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) are specified. Although PGCs in general originate as a single cluster of cells, the somatic parts of the gonad form on each site of the embryo. Thus, to reach the gonad, PGCs not only migrate from their site of origin but also split into two groups. Taking advantage of high-resolution real-time imaging, we show that in Drosophila melanogaster PGCs are polarized and migrate directionally toward the SGPs, avoiding the midline. Unexpectedly, neither PGC attractants synthesized in the SGPs nor known midline repellents for axon guidance were required to sort PGCs bilaterally. Repellent activity provided by wunen (wun) and wunen-2 (wun-2) expressed in the central nervous system, however, is essential in this migration process and controls PGC survival. Our results suggest that expression of wun/wun-2 repellents along the migratory paths provides faithful control over the sorting of PGCs into two gonads and eliminates PGCs left in the middle of the embryo.",2005,"Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Ruth Lehmann, Hiroko Sano, Andrew D Renault, Ruth Lehmann"
Genotoxicity and anti-genotoxicity of some traditional medicinal herbs,16005256,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2005.05.004,"Six herbal infusions used worldwide (Matricaria chamomilla, Tilia cordata, Mentha piperita, Mentha pulegium, Uncaria tomentosa and Valeriana officinalis) were assayed for anti-genotoxicity using the Somatic Mutation And Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. All these infusions are traditionally used for various medical purposes, including anti-inflammatory processes. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidative genotoxicant to test the anti-genotoxic potency of the medicinal infusions. None of these infusions showed a significant genotoxicity, quite the reverse they were able to behave as desmutagens, detoxifying the mutagen hydrogen peroxide.

Adult myogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster can proceed independently of myocyte enhancer factor-2,15956678,10.1534/genetics.105.041749,"Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) is a transcription factor that is necessary for embryonic muscle development in Drosophila and vertebrates; however, whether this factor is required during later muscle development remains largely unknown. Using heteroallelic combinations of different Mef2 mutant alleles, we isolated and characterized a temperature-sensitive combination. Through temperature-shift experiments, we obtained adult animals that were lacking proper MEF2 function. Many of these individuals died as mature pupae, and those that eclosed showed poor locomotion and an inability to fly. Histological analysis of these animals revealed a requirement for MEF2 in skeletal muscle patterning, although these animals had strikingly normal amounts of muscle tissue. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we determined that expression of the MEF2-regulated actin gene Act57B was severely reduced in these animals. By contrast myofibrillar actin genes unique to the adult stage were only mildly affected. Since MEF2 mutant adults were still capable of forming muscle tissue, we conclude that MEF2 is required for the expression of only a subset of muscle structural genes in the adult. These results indicate that additional muscle-specific factors function to control the myogenesis of complex and diverse muscle in the adult.",2005,"Phillip W Baker, Kathleen K Kelly Tanaka, Niels Klitgord, Richard M Cripps, Phillip W Baker, Kathleen K Kelly Tanaka, Niels Klitgord, Richard M Cripps"
The exocyst component Sec5 is present on endocytic vesicles in the oocyte of Drosophila melanogaster,15955846,10.1083/jcb.200411053,"The exocyst is an octameric complex required for polarized secretion. Some components of the exocyst are found on the plasma membrane, whereas others are recruited to Golgi membranes, suggesting that exocyst assembly tethers vesicles to their site of fusion. We have found that in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes the majority of the exocyst component Sec5 is unexpectedly present in clathrin-coated pits and vesicles at the plasma membrane. In oocytes, the major substrate for clathrin-dependent endocytosis is the vitellogenin receptor Yolkless. A truncation mutant of Sec5 (sec5(E13)) allows the formation of normally sized oocytes but with greatly reduced yolk uptake. We find that in sec5(E13) oocytes Yolkless accumulates aberrantly in late endocytic compartments, indicating a defect in the endocytic cycling of the receptor. An analogous truncation of the yeast SEC5 gene results in normal secretion but a temperature-sensitive defect in endocytic recycling. Thus, the exocyst may act in both Golgi to plasma membrane traffic and endocytic cycling, and hence in oocytes is recruited to clathrin-coated pits to facilitate the rapid recycling of Yolkless.",2005,"Bernhard Sommer, Adrian Oprins, Catherine Rabouille, Sean Munro, Bernhard Sommer, Adrian Oprins, Catherine Rabouille, Sean Munro"
Sequence polymorphism of candidate behavioural genes in Drosophila melanogaster flies from 'Evolution canyon',16101788,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02616.x,"This study focuses on the molecular features of three candidate behavioural genes in Drosophila melanogaster from the opposite slopes of Nahal Oren Canyon, Mount Carmel, Israel. These slopes display dramatic physical and biotic contrasts. Spatial variation of microclimatic conditions leads to adaptive differentiation and partial sexual isolation of populations, as suggested by our previous studies. The chosen candidate genes presumably contributing to genetic variation in sexual behaviour of Drosophila in the Canyon were desaturase, period, and no-on-transient A. These genes are known to include polymorphic repeated sequences, insertions/deletions, or nucleotide substitutions. The idea was that their polymorphism might be one of the determinants of behavioural peculiarities of flies derived from the opposite slopes. Indeed, interslope differences in the sequence encoding the (Thr-Gly)n repeat (exon 5) of the period gene were established, suggesting evolutionary functional importance. In particular, we unraveled variation in the length and composition of this region in different NFS (north-facing slope) and SFS (south-facing slope) lines. The 'European' allele (n = 20) was a 2.6-fold more abundant on the NFS compared to the SFS. This predominance probably gives some advantages for flies inhabiting wet and less warm conditions of the NFS. We suggest that repeat length/composition may influence the functional features of flies, i.e. habitat choice, nonrandom mating, and temperature adaptation. A series of female single-mate-choice tests show that females derived from NFS distinguish between males with specific per alleles (n = 17 vs. n = 20), as well as between males originated from the opposing slopes. Females from SFS were less discriminating and did not manifest significant deviation from random mating.",2005,"I Zamorzaeva, E Rashkovetsky, E Nevo, A Korol, I Zamorzaeva, E Rashkovetsky, E Nevo, A Korol"
Tribolium castaneum twist: gastrulation and mesoderm formation in a short-germ beetle,15645317,10.1007/s00427-004-0446-9,"Mesoderm formation has been extensively analyzed in the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster. In Drosophila, both the invagination and specification of the mesoderm is controlled by twist. Here we present a detailed description of mesoderm formation and twist regulation for the short-germ beetle Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to Drosophila, (1) the presumptive mesodermal cells of Tribolium are part of a mitotic domain and divide prior to ventral furrow formation, (2) ventral furrow formation progresses from posterior to anterior, (3) the number of cell layers within the furrow changes from multilayered in caudal to single layered in cephalic regions, and (4) there is a continuous production of mesodermal cells after gastrulation as new segments arise from the posterior growth zone. Tribolium twist (Tc-twist) is initially expressed in all presumptive mesodermal cells; however, after invagination, expression is maintained only in particular locations, which include the anterior compartments of the cephalic segments and a patch of cells at the posterior rim of the growth zone. The growth zone is multilayered with its inner cell layer being continuous with the mesoderm of the newly forming segments where twist expression is re-initiated anterior to the emerging engrailed stripes. A genomic region of Tc-twist was identified which drives ventral expression of a reporter construct in Drosophila. The expression of this Tc-twist construct in the background of Drosophila maternal mutations suggests that the dorsoventral system regulates Tc-twist, but that differences exist in regulation of the Dm-twist and Tc-twist genes by the terminal system.",2005,"Klaus Handel, Abidin Basal, Xiang Fan, Siegfried Roth, Klaus Handel, Abidin Basal, Xiang Fan, Siegfried Roth"
Longevity and metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster: genetic correlations between life span and age-specific metabolic rate in populations artificially selected for long life,15466435,10.1534/genetics.104.030403,"We measured age-specific metabolic rates in 2861 individual Drosophila melanogaster adult males to determine how genetic variation in metabolism is related to life span. Using recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived from populations artificially selected for long life, resting metabolic rates were measured at 5, 16, 29, and 47 days posteclosion, while life spans were measured in the same genotypes in mixed-sex population cages and in single-sex vials. We observed much heritable variation between lines in age-specific metabolic rates, evidence for genotype x age interaction, and moderate to large heritabilities at all ages except the youngest. Four traits exhibit evidence of coordinate genetic control: day 16 and day 29 metabolic rates, life span in population cages, and life span in vials. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for those traits map to the same locations on three major chromosomes, and additive genetic effects are all positively correlated. In contrast, metabolic rates at the youngest and oldest ages are unrelated to metabolic rates at other ages and to survival. We suggest that artificial selection for long life via delayed reproduction also selects for increased metabolism at intermediate ages. Contrary to predictions of the ""rate of living"" theory, we find no evidence that metabolic rate varies inversely with survival, at the level of either line means or additive effects of QTL.",2005,"Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger, Aziz A Khazaeli, Wayne Van Voorhies, James W Curtsinger"

In addition, a transgenic gynandromorph was recovered in which one-half of the insect was expressing the kynurenine hydroxylase transgene, including one eye with red pigmentation, whereas the other half of the insect was homozygous khw and included a white eye.

H functions as antagonist in the Notch-signaling pathway in Drosophila, and the link to growth and apoptosis is poorly understood. To further our insight into H-mediated apoptosis, we performed two large-scale screens for modifiers of a small rough eye phenotype caused by H overexpression. Both loss- and gain-of-function screens revealed known and new genetic interactors representing diverse cellular functions. Many of them did not cause eye phenotypes on their own, emphasizing a specific genetic interaction with H. As expected, we also identified components of different signaling pathways supposed to be involved in the regulation of cell growth and cell death. Accordingly, some of them also acted as modifiers of proapoptotic genes, suggesting a more general involvement in the regulation of apoptosis. Overall, these screens highlight the importance of H and the Notch pathway in mediating cell death in response to developmental and environmental cues and emphasize their role in maintaining developmental cellular homeostasis.",2005,"Dominik MÃ¼ller, Sabrina J Kugler, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel, Dominik MÃ¼ller, Sabrina J Kugler, Anette Preiss, Dieter Maier, Anja C Nagel"
Full genome gene expression analysis of the heat stress response in Drosophila melanogaster,16333985,10.1379/csc-128r1.1,"The availability of full genome sequences has allowed the construction of microarrays, with which screening of the full genome for changes in gene expression is possible. This method can provide a wealth of information about biology at the level of gene expression and is a powerful method to identify genes and pathways involved in various processes. In this study, we report a detailed analysis of the full heat stress response in Drosophila melanogaster females, using whole genome gene expression arrays (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The study focuses on up- as well as downregulation of genes from just before and at 8 time points after an application of short heat hardening (36 degrees C for 1 hour). The expression changes were followed up to 64 hours after the heat stress, using 4 biological replicates. This study describes in detail the dramatic change in gene expression over time induced by a short-term heat treatment. We found both known stress responding genes and new candidate genes, and processes to be involved in the stress response. We identified 3 main groups of stress responsive genes that were early-upregulated, early-downregulated, and late-upregulated, respectively, among 1222 differentially expressed genes in the data set. Comparisons with stress sensitive genes identified by studies of responses to other types of stress allow the discussion of heat-specific and general stress responses in Drosophila. Several unexpected features were revealed by this analysis, which suggests that novel pathways and mechanisms are involved in the responses to heat stress and to stress in general. The majority of stress responsive genes identified in this and other studies were downregulated, and the degree of overlap among downregulated genes was relatively high, whereas genes responding by upregulation to heat and other stress factors were more specific to the stress applied or to the conditions of the particular study.

The relationship between the rate of transposition and transposable element copy number for copia and Doc retrotransposons of Drosophila melanogaster,9802257,10.1017/s0016672398003358,"We present data on the relationship between the rate of transposition and copy number in the genome for the copia and Doc retrotransposons of Drosophila melanogaster. copia and Doc transposition rates were directly measured in sublines of the isogenic 2b line using individual males or females, respectively, with a range of copia copy numbers from 49 to 103 and Doc copy numbers from 112 to 235 per genome. Transposition rates varied from 3 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-2) for copia and from 2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-3) for Doc. A positive relationship between transposition rate and copy number was found both for copia and for Doc when the data were analysed across all the 2b individuals; no significant correlation was found when the data were analysed across the subline means for both retrotransposons tested. Overall, correlation between copia and Doc transposition rate and their copy number in the genome, if any, was not negative, which would be expected if transposable elements (TEs) self-regulate their copy number. Thus, for copia and Doc no evidence for self-regulation was provided, and at least for these two TEs this hypothesis is not favoured for explaining the maintenance of the stable copy number that is characteristic for natural populations. The transposition rate of copia was measured twice, and a strong positive correlation between copy number and transposition rate both across individuals and subline means was found in 1994, while in 1995 no correlation was found. This fact is in agreement with the hypothesis that a positive correlation between the rate of transposition and TE copy number may be a default starting point for future host-TE coevolution.",1998,"E G Pasyukova, S V Nuzhdin, D A Filatov, E G Pasyukova, S V Nuzhdin, D A Filatov"
Su(UR)ES: a gene suppressing DNA underreplication in intercalary and pericentric heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes,9636184,10.1073/pnas.95.13.7532,"A genetic locus suppressing DNA underreplication in intercalary heterochromatin (IH) and pericentric heterochromatin (PH) of the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands, has been described. Found in the In(1)scV2 strain, the mutation, designated as Su(UR)ES, was located on chromosome 3L at position 34. 8 and cytologically mapped to region 68A3-B4. A cytological phenotype was observed in the salivary gland chromosomes of larvae homozygous and hemizygous for Su(UR)ES: (i) in the IH regions, that normally are incompletely polytenized and so they often break to form ""weak points,"" underreplication is suppressed, breaks and ectopic contacts disappear; (ii) the degree of polytenization in PH grows higher. That is why the regions in chromosome arm basements, normally beta-heterochromatic, acquire a distinct banding pattern, i. e., become euchromatic by morphological criteria; (iii) an additional bulk of polytenized material arises between the arms of chromosome 3 to form a fragment with a typical banding pattern. Chromosome 2 PH reveals additional alpha-heterochromatin. Su(UR)ES does not affect the viability, fertility, or morphological characters of the imago, and has semidominant expression in the heterozygote and distinct maternal effect.

"The mutation rates of di-, tri- and tetranucleotide repeats in Drosophila melanogaster",9866209,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025901,"In a recent study, we reported that the combined average mutation rate of 10 di-, 6 tri-, and 8 tetranucleotide repeats in Drosophila melanogaster was 6.3 x 10(-6) mutations per locus per generation, a rate substantially below that of microsatellite repeat units in mammals studied to date (range = 10(-2)-10(-5) per locus per generation). To obtain a more precise estimate of mutation rate for dinucleotide repeat motifs alone, we assayed 39 new dinucleotide repeat microsatellite loci in the mutation accumulation lines from our earlier study. Our estimate of mutation rate for a total of 49 dinucleotide repeats is 9.3 x 10(-6) per locus per generation, only slightly higher than the estimate from our earlier study. We also estimated the relative difference in microsatellite mutation rate among di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats in the genome of D. melanogaster using a method based on population variation, and we found that tri- and tetranucleotide repeats mutate at rates 6.4 and 8.4 times slower than that of dinucleotide repeats, respectively. The slower mutation rates of tri- and tetranucleotide repeats appear to be associated with a relatively short repeat unit length of these repeat motifs in the genome of D. melanogaster.

Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis, which possess dot chromosomes, were used as a control. The in situ hybridization results show that dot chromosome genes of D. melanogaster and D. virilis are closely linked in chromosome 3 of D. willistoni and in chromosome X of S. lebanonensis.

Drosophila projectin, the giant protein component of the third filament is quite unusual as it not only shows specific isoforms in various muscle types, but these isoforms are located at different sarcomeric locations, I band in the IFM and A band in synchronous muscles. This may suggest distinct functions for the projectin protein in various muscles, as well as a different set of protein interactions for each projectin isoform. Projectin is encoded by a single gene and the isoforms were proposed to be the result of alternative splicing of a primary transcript. Here, we report the nearly complete sequence of Drosophila projectin, as well as the possible splicing patterns used to generate different isoforms. The overall domain organization in projectin is composed of repeated motifs I and II in a few specific patterns, similar to its Caenorhabditis homolog, twitchin. Sequence similarity between twitchin and projectin further suggests how some domains may possibly be important for protein interactions and/or functions. Alternative splicing operates at the COOH terminus, leading to a shorter projectin protein lacking some of the terminal motifs II and unique sequence.

Transgenic Drosophila expressing human amyloid precursor protein show gamma-secretase activity and a blistered-wing phenotype,9811864,10.1073/pnas.95.23.13703,"The importance of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) became apparent through the identification of distinct mutations in the APP gene, causing early onset familial AD with the accumulation of a 4-kDa peptide fragment (betaA4) in amyloid plaques and vascular deposits.

In this work, Drosophila melanogaster is used as a model system to analyze the function of APP by expressing wild-type and various mutant forms of human APP in fly tissue culture cells as well as in transgenic fly lines. After expression of full-length APP forms, secretion of APP but not of betaA4 was observed in both systems. By using SPA4CT, a short APP form in which the signal peptide was fused directly to the betaA4 region, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail, we observed betaA4 release in flies and fly-tissue culture cells. Consequently, we showed a gamma-secretase activity in flies. Interestingly, transgenic flies expressing full-length forms of APP have a blistered-wing phenotype. As the wing is composed of interacting dorsal and ventral epithelial cell layers, this phenotype suggests that human APP expression interferes with cell adhesion/signaling pathways in Drosophila, independently of betaA4 generation.",1998,"A Fossgreen, B BrÃ¼ckner, C Czech, C L Masters, K Beyreuther, R Paro, A Fossgreen, B BrÃ¼ckner, C Czech, C L Masters, K Beyreuther, R Paro"
"[Correlation between the number of sites, transcript levels and transposition frequency of retrotransposon copia in Drosophila melanogaster]",9589871,,"Numbers of copia transcripts in testes of files from five Drosophila melanogaster lines were compared by means of Northern blot hybridization. Four of these lines were closely related differing only by transposition rates and the number of copia sites in the genome. The fifth line, which was not related to the others, was characterized by lack of transpositions and the lowest copia copy number. Positive correlation between total copia transcript level and its copy number and transposition rate was observed. Therefore, transcription rate of copia retrotransposon in tests is largely controlled by the level of its transcription, which, in turn, is regulated by the number of retrotransposon copies in the genome. These data contradict the hypothesis on self-regulation of retrotransposon copy number in the genome.",1998,"D A Filatov, E G Pasiukova, D A Filatov, E G Pasiukova"
Conservation of read-through transcription of the Drosophila serendipity genes during evolution is gratuitous,9790579,10.1007/s004380050839,"The Drosophila melanogaster serendipity (sry) genes sry alpha and sry beta, which code for unrelated proteins and functions, are transcribed both as monocistronic (sry alpha, srv beta) and dicistronic (sry beta-sry alpha) polyadenylated transcripts, the three types of transcripts being differentially expressed throughout development. We show here that, while the sry gene cluster is conserved in two other distantly related Drosophila species, sry beta-sry alpha dicistronic transcription is observed in one of them, Drosophila pseudoobscura but not in the other, Drosophila virilis, indicating that this mode of transcription is not subject to selection during evolution. Sequence comparison of the intergenic sry beta-sry alpha region suggests that sry, beta-sry alpha read-through transcription results from interference between initiation of transcription at the sry alpha promoter and 3' processing of the upstream sry beta transcript. From these and previous analyses, we propose that read-through transcription at the sry locus reflects its clustered gene organisation but is functionally gratuitous. This conclusion is supported by the autonomous rate of evolutionary sequence divergence shown by each individual sry gene.",1998,"S Ibnsouda, P Ferrer, A Vincent, S Ibnsouda, P Ferrer, A Vincent"
Effects of stress combinations on the expression of additive genetic variation for fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,9802258,10.1017/s0016672398003310,"To test whether stressful conditions altered levels of heritable variation in fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, parent-offspring comparisons were undertaken across three generations for flies reared in a combined stress (ethanol, cold shock, low nutrition) environment or a control environment. The stressful conditions did not directly influence fecundity but did lead to a reduced fecundity in the offspring generations, perhaps reflecting cross-generation maternal effects. Both the heritability and evolvability estimates were higher in the combined stress treatment, reflecting an apparent increase in the additive genetic variance under stress. In contrast, there were no consistent changes in the environmental variance across environments.",1998,"C M SgrÃ², A A Hoffmann, C M SgrÃ², A A Hoffmann"
[Genotypic basis of low viability in vestigial mutants of Drosophila melanogaster],9879011,,"The role of a marker mutation and other genes in a decrease in viability was studied in the Drosophila melanogaster vg line. In flies of the C-S line, chromosome 2 was substituted by the homologous chromosome of the vg flies. In addition, the flies of the mutant phenotype with mutant genes partially or completely substituted by the wild-type C-S genes were obtained in saturating crosses C-S x vg. In the reciprocal variant of chromosome 2 substitution, the flies of the C-S phenotype with chromosomes 1, 3, and 4 from the vg line were obtained. Chromosome 2 of the vg line, introduced into C-S fly karyotype, proved to substantially reduce the heat resistance and life span of flies. In the case of reciprocal replacement (C-S line chromosome 2 substituted for the homologous chromosome of vg flies), a significant increase in viability was observed, which, however, never reached the level characteristic of the C-S line. As the vg genotype became saturated with C-S genes, the heat resistance and life span of flies increased substantially. However, even the complete saturation of mutant chromosomes with wild-type genes never resulted in the equal viability of vg and C-S flies. These data suggest that the low viability of the vg mutant is largely accounted for by the gene composition of the second chromosome and, primarily, by the presence of the vg gene. Nevertheless, there is evidence that, along with the pleiotropic effect of the marker mutation, other genes not linked to chromosome 2 are responsible for the studied physiological properties of the vg flies.",1998,"V N TotskiÄ­, N D Khaustova, L V Levchuk, S V Morgun, V N TotskiÄ­, N D Khaustova, L V Levchuk, S V Morgun"
Genetic mapping of the amide response element(s) of the hsr omega locus of Drosophila melanogaster,9601981,10.1007/s004120050288,"Small chromosomal deletions [Df(3R)eR-1 and Df(3R)eP] with intact hsromega transcription units but with variable deletions of the upstream region were used to map the upstream regions that regulate heat shock and amide responsivity of the 93D puff (hsromega locus) in salivary glands of late third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. The Df(3R)eP deletion, generated by a P-element mobilization screen, removed the 93B6-7 to 93D3-5 cytogenetic region. [3H]uridine-labeled transcription autoradiograms revealed that normal developmental and heat shock-induced expression of the 93D puff remained unaffected in both the deficiency chromosomes. However, the amide responsivity of the 93D site was lost on the Df(3R)eP homolog while the Df(3R)eR-1 homolog responded normally to amides. Southern hybridizations with a series of upstream probes mapped the distal breakpoint of the Df(3R)eP deletion between -22 kb and -23 kb of the hsromega transcription unit. Since the distal breakpoint of Df(3R)eR-1 is at about -45 kb upstream of the hsromega gene it is inferred that the amide response element(s) that modulate the specific transcriptional activation of the 93D puff following treatment of salivary glands with a variety of amides is/are located in the -22 kb to about -45 kb upstream interval. The Df(3R)eP and Df(3R)eR-1 deletions also abolished dosage compensation at the 93D locus as well as the effect of beta-alanine levels on its heat shock inducibility.",1998,"S C Lakhotia, M G Tapadia, S C Lakhotia, M G Tapadia"

Between species, the abundance in the heterochromatin and on the Y chromosome of the elements of the same family can differ greatly suggesting that differences within a species are unrelated to structural features of elements.

Probable mechanisms underlying interallelic complementation and temperature-sensitivity of mutations at the shibire locus of Drosophila melanogaster,9611210,,"The shibire locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes dynamin, a GTPase required for the fission of endocytic vesicles from plasma membrane. Biochemical studies indicate that mammalian dynamin is part of a complex containing multiple dynamin subunits and other polypeptides. To gain insight into sequences of dynamin critical for its function, we have characterized in detail a collection of conditional and lethal shi alleles. We describe a probable null allele of shi and show that its properties are distinct from those of two classes of lethal alleles (termed I and II) that show intergroup, interallelic complementation. Sequenced class I alleles, which display dominant properties, carry missense mutations in conserved residues in the GTPase domain of dynamin. In contrast, the sequenced class II alleles, which appear completely recessive, carry missense mutations in conserved residues of a previously uncharacterized ""middle domain"" that lies adjacent to the GTPase region. These data suggest that critical interactions mediated by this middle domain are severely affected by the class II lethal mutations; thus, the mutant sequences should be very useful for confirming the in vivo relevance of interactions observed in vitro. Viable heteroallelic combinations of shi lethals show rapid and reversible temperature-sensitive paralytic phenotypes hitherto only described for the ts alleles of shi. When taken together with the molecular analysis of shi mutations, these observations suggest that the GTPase domain of dynamin carries an intrinsically temperature-sensitive activity: hypomorphic mutations that reduce this activity at low temperatures result in conditional temperature-sensitive phenotype. These observations explain why screens for conditional paralytic mutants in Drosophila inevitably recover ts alleles of shi at high frequencies.",1998,"D Grant, S Unadkat, A Katzen, K S Krishnan, M Ramaswami, D Grant, S Unadkat, A Katzen, K S Krishnan, M Ramaswami"
Molecular evolution of the Cecropin multigene family in Drosophila. functional genes vs. pseudogenes,9725836,,"Approximately 4 kb of the Cecropin cluster region have been sequenced in nine lines of Drosophila melanogaster and one line of the sibling species D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia. This region includes three functional genes (CecA1, CecA2, and CecB), which are involved in the insect immune response, and two pseudogenes (CecPsi1 and CecPsi2). The level of silent polymorphism in the three Cec genes is rather high (0.028), and there is no excess of nonsynonymous polymorphism. There is no evidence of gene conversion in the history of these genes. The interspecific comparison has revealed that in the three species of the simulans cluster the CecA2 gene is partially deleted and has therefore lost its function and become a pseudogene; in each of the species, subsequent deletions have accumulated. Divergence estimates indicate that the CecPsi1 and CecPsi2 pseudogenes are highly diverged, both between themselves and relative to the other three Cec genes. However, both CecPsi1 and CecPsi2 have conserved transcriptional signals and splice sites, and they present an open reading frame; also, correctly spliced transcripts have been detected for both CecPsi1 and CecPsi2. The data support that these genes are either active genes with some null alleles or young pseudogenes.",1998,"S Ramos-Onsins, M AguadÃ©, S Ramos-Onsins, M AguadÃ©"
Conserved regions of the timeless (tim) clock gene in Drosophila analyzed through phylogenetic and functional studies,9504927,,"Circadian (approximately 24-hr) rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster depend upon cyclic expression of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes, which encode interacting components of the endogenous clock. The per gene has been isolated from other insects and, more recently, a per ortholog was found in mammals where its expression oscillates in a circadian fashion. We report here the complete sequence of a tim gene from another species, Drosophila virilis. TIM is better conserved than the PER protein is between these two species (76 vs. 54% overall amino acid identity), and putative functional domains, such as the PER interaction domains and the nuclear localization signal, are highly conserved. The acidic domain and the cytoplasmic localization domain, however, are within the least conserved regions. In addition, the initiating methionine in the D. virilis gene lies downstream of the proposed translation start for the original D. melanogaster tim cDNA and corresponds to the one used by D. simulans and D. yakuba. Among the most conserved parts of TIM is a region of unknown function near the N terminus. We show here that deletion of a 32 amino acid segment within this region affects rescue of rhythms in arrhythmic tim01 flies. Flies carrying a full-length tim transgene displayed rhythms with approximately 24-hr periods, indicating that a fully functional clock can be restored in tim01 flies through expression of a tim transgene.

An experimental test for lineage-specific position effects on alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes in Drosophila,9861000,10.1073/pnas.95.26.15513,"Independent transgene insertions differ in expression based on their location in the genome; these position effects are of interest because they reflect the influence of genome organization on gene regulation. Position effects also represent potentially insurmountable obstacles to the rigorous functional comparison of homologous genes from different species because (i) quantitative variation in expression of each gene across genomic positions (generalized position effects, or GPEs) may overwhelm differences between the genes of interest, or (ii) divergent genes may be differentially sensitive to position effects, reflecting unique interactions between each gene and its genomic milieu (lineage-specific position effects, or LSPEs). We have investigated both types of position-effect variation by applying our method of transgene coplacement, which allows comparisons of transgenes in the same position in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report an experimental test for LSPE in Drosophila. The alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) genes of D. melanogaster and Drosophila affinidisjuncta differ in both tissue distribution and amounts of ADH activity. Despite this striking regulatory divergence, we found a very high correlation in overall ADH activity between the genes of the two species when placed in the same genomic position as assayed in otherwise Adh-null adults and larvae. These results argue against the influence of LSPE for these sequences, although the effects of GPE are significant. Our new findings validate the coplacement approach and show that it greatly magnifies the power to detect differences in expression between transgenes. Transgene coplacement thus dramatically extends the range of functional and evolutionary questions that can be addressed by transgenic technology.",1998,"M L Siegal, D L Hartl, M L Siegal, D L Hartl"
Function of Glu-469' in the acid-base catalysis of thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,18991392,10.1021/bi801449h,"Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyzes the reduction of thioredoxin (Trx) by NADPH. Because dipteran insects such as Drosophila melanogaster lack glutathione reductase, their TrxRs are particularly important for antioxidant protection; reduced Trx reacts nonenzymatically with oxidized glutathione to maintain a high glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio. Like other members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, TrxR is a homodimer; in the enzyme from D. melanogaster (DmTrxR), each catalytically active unit consists of three redox centers: FAD and an N-terminal Cys-57-Cys-62 redox-active disulfide from one monomer and a Cys-489'-Cys-490' C-terminal redox-active disulfide from the second monomer. A dyad of His-464' and Glu-469' in TrxR acts as the acid-base catalyst of the dithiol-disulfide interchange reactions required in catalysis [Huang, H.-H., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 1721-1731]. In this investigation, the role of Glu-469' in catalysis by DmTrxR has been studied. The E469'A and E469'Q DmTrxR variants retain 28 and 35% of the wild-type activity, respectively, indicating that this glutamate residue is important but not critical to catalysis. The pH dependence of V(max) for both glutamate variants yields pK(a) values of 6.0 and 8.7, compared to those in the wild-type enzyme of 6.4 and 9.3, respectively, indicating that the basicity of His-464' in TrxR in complex with its substrate, DmTrx-2, is significantly lower in the glutamate variants than in wild-type enzyme. The rates of some steps in the reductive half-reactions in both glutamate variants are much slower than those of the wild-type enzyme. On the basis of our observations, it is proposed that the function of Glu-469' is to facilitate the positioning of His-464' toward the interchange thiol, Cys-57, as suggested for the analogous residue in glutathione reductase.",2008,"Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams, Hsin-Hung Huang, L David Arscott, David P Ballou, Charles H Williams"

Drosophila melanogaster kl-3 and kl-5 Y-loops harbor triple-stranded nucleic acids,18430782,10.1242/jcs.025320,"Primary spermatocyte nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster contain three prominent lampbrush-like loops.

These loci have huge physical dimensions and contain extremely long introns. In addition, kl-3 and kl-5 were shown to encode two putative dynein subunits required for the correct assembly of the sperm axoneme. Here, we show that both the kl-5 and kl-3 loops are intensely decorated by monoclonal antibodies recognizing triple-stranded nucleic acids, and that each loop presents a peculiar molecular organization of triplex structures. Moreover, immunostaining of Drosophila hydei primary spermatocytes revealed that also in this species - which diverged from D. melanogaster 58 million years ago - Y-loops are decorated by anti-triplex antibodies, strongly suggesting a conserved role of loop-associated triplexes. Finally, we showed that in D. melanogaster wild-type lines that are raised at the non-permissive temperature of 31+/-0.5 degrees C (which is known to induce male sterility in flies) both the triplex immunostaining and the axonemal dynein heavy chains encoded by kl-3 and kl-5 are no longer detectable, which suggests a functional correlation between loop-associated triplexes, the presence of axonemal proteins and male fertility in fly.",2008,"Roberto Piergentili, Caterina Mencarelli, Roberto Piergentili, Caterina Mencarelli"
Structure of the ovaries and follicular epithelium morphogenesis in Drosophila and its kin,18648852,10.1007/s00427-008-0233-0,"In insects, the ovarian follicular epithelium morphogenesis has been intensively studied and best characterized in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. It is well established that initially identical somatic follicular cells (FCs) form a simple epithelium overlying the germline cells, but during oogenesis, they diversify into a number of morphologically distinct subpopulations each responsible for creating specific eggshell structures. In addition, some FC subpopulations (e.g. polar cells) are indispensable in establishing antero-posterior and dorso-ventral ovarian follicle axes and patterning of the developing embryo. The morphological and molecular changes that occur during follicular epithelium morphogenesis in Drosophila are frequently considered as a paradigm of the FC diversification in all flies. However, recent comparative studies indicate that, in dipterans, the functioning of the ovarian follicles is diverse, group-specific and may significantly differ from the Drosophila model system. We discuss the similarities and differences of the ovary structure and follicular epithelium morphogenesis in different dipteran groups and put them into a phylognetic context. We suggest that the migratory activity of the FCs represents an evolutionary novelty that evolved in the ancestors of higher dipterans (Brachycera). Subsequently, during evolution of this subgroup, the number of migrating FC subpopulations has gradually increased from one (in Orthorrhapha) to four (in Cyclorrhapha).",2008,"Mariusz K Jaglarz, Wieslaw Krzeminski, Szczepan M Bilinski, Mariusz K Jaglarz, Wieslaw Krzeminski, Szczepan M Bilinski"
Casein kinase I epsilon does not rescue double-time function in Drosophila despite evolutionarily conserved roles in the circadian clock,18258753,10.1177/0748730407311652,"Double-time (dbt) is a casein kinase gene involved in cell survival, proliferation, and circadian rhythms in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that dbt and its mammalian ortholog casein kinase I epsilon (hckI epsilon) regulate the circadian phosphorylation of period (per), thus controlling per subcellular localization and stability. Mutations in these kinases can shorten the circadian period in both mammals and Drosophila. Since similar activities in circadian clock have been described for these kinases, we investigated whether the expression of mammalian casein kinase I can replace the activity of dbt in flies. Global expression of the full-length dbt rescued lethality of the null mutant dbt revVIII and rescued flies showed normal locomotor activity rhythms. Global expression of dbt also restored the locomotor activity rhythm of the arrhythmic genotype, dbt ar/dbt revVIII. In contrast, global expression of hckI epsilon or hckI alpha did not rescue lethality or locomotor activity of dbt mutants. Furthermore dbt overexpression in wild-type clock cells had only a small effect on period length, whereas hckI epsilon expression in clock cells greatly lengthened period to ~30.5 hours and increased the number of arrhythmic flies. These results indicate that hckI epsilon cannot replace the activity of dbt in flies despite the high degree of similarity in primary sequence and kinase function. Moreover, expression of hck Iepsilon in flies appears to interfere with dbt activity. Thus, caution should be used in interpreting assays that measure activity of mammalian casein kinase mutants in Drosophila, or that employ vertebrate CKI in studies of dPER phosphorylations.",2008,"Tatsumori Sekine, Terumi Yamaguchi, Kunikatsu Hamano, Michael W Young, Masami Shimoda, Lino Saez, Tatsumori Sekine, Terumi Yamaguchi, Kunikatsu Hamano, Michael W Young, Masami Shimoda, Lino Saez"
Location of P element insertions in the proximal promoter region of Hsp70A is consequential for gene expression and correlated with fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster,18347937,10.1007/s12192-007-0002-4,"We compared a series of Drosophila strains with P element insertions from -28 to -144 nucleotides 5' to the transcription start site of the Hsp70A genes-corresponding to the range of naturally occurring P element insertion sites-to elucidate the consequences of insertion site for Hsp70A gene expression. Although all insertions reduced Hsp70A expression below that of a control strain, the magnitude of the reduction was inversely related to the number of nucleotides between the transcription start site and the insertion site. A pre-existing hypothesis is that naturally occurring transposable element insertions in Hsp promoters may be beneficial in some circumstances, which may account for their retention in natural populations. In the present study, in a control line heat shock reduced fecundity, whereas in lines with P element insertions heat shock typically increased fecundity. Finally, according to cluster-specific quantitative RT-PCR, expression of the Hsp70A cluster genes was typically greater than that of the Hsp70B gene cluster genes, although the latter are more numerous and, in this case, free of P element insertions.",2008,"Bing Chen, Victoria Y Shilova, Olga G Zatsepina, Michael B Evgen'ev, Martin E Feder, Bing Chen, Victoria Y Shilova, Olga G Zatsepina, Michael B Evgen'ev, Martin E Feder"
Sex combs are important for male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster,18213513,10.1007/s10519-008-9190-7,"The sex comb is one of the most rapidly evolving male-specific traits in Drosophila, making it an attractive model to study sexual selection and developmental evolution. Drosophila males use their sex combs to grasp the females' abdomen and genitalia and to spread their wings prior to copulation. To test the role of this structure in male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster, we genetically ablated the sex comb by expressing the female-specific isoform of the sex determination gene transformer in the tarsal segments of male legs. This technique does not remove the sex comb entirely, but simply restores the morphology of its constituent bristles to the ancestral condition found in Drosophila species that lack sex combs. Direct observations and differences in long-term insemination rates show that the loss of the sex comb strongly reduces the ability of males to copulate with females. Detailed analysis of video recordings indicates that this effect is not due to changes in the males' courtship behavior. Rapid evolution of sex comb morphology may be driven either by changes in female preferences, or by co-evolution between sex combs and female external genitalia.",2008,"Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp, Chen Siang Ng, Artyom Kopp"
Evolutionary origin and genomic organisation of runt-domain containing genes in arthropods,19032778,10.1186/1471-2164-9-558,"Background:
      
    

    
      Gene clusters, such as the Hox gene cluster, are known to have critical roles in development. In eukaryotes gene clusters arise primarily by tandem gene duplication and divergence. Genes within a cluster are often co-regulated, providing selective pressure to maintain the genome organisation, and this co-regulation can result in temporal or spatial co-linearity of gene expression. It has been previously noted that in Drosophila melanogaster, three of the four runt-domain (RD) containing genes are found in a relatively tight cluster on chromosome 1, raising the possibility of a putative functional RD gene cluster in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To investigate the possibility of such a gene cluster, orthologues of the Drosophila melanogaster RD genes were identified in several endopterygotan insects, two exopterygotan insects and two non-insect arthropods. In all insect species four RD genes were identified and orthology was assigned to the Drosophila sequences by phylogenetic analyses. Although four RD genes were found in the crustacean D. pulex, orthology could not be assigned to the insect sequences, indicating independent gene duplications from a single ancestor following the split of the hexapod lineage from the crustacean lineage.In insects, two chromosomal arrangements of these genes was observed; the first a semi-dispersed cluster, such as in Drosophila, where lozenge is separated from the core cluster of three RD genes often by megabases of DNA. The second arrangement was a tight cluster of the four RD genes, such as in Apis mellifera.This genomic organisation, particularly of the three core RD genes, raises the possibility of shared regulatory elements. In situ hybridisation of embryonic expression of the four RD genes in Drosophila melanogaster and the honeybee A. mellifera shows no evidence for either spatial or temporal co-linearity of expression during embryogenesis.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      All fully sequenced insect genomes contain four RD genes and orthology can be assigned to these genes based on similarity to the D. melanogaster protein sequences. Examination of the genomic organisation of these genes provides evidence for a functional RD gene cluster. RD genes from non-insect arthropods are also clustered, however the lack of orthology between these and insect RD genes suggests this cluster is likely to have resulted from a duplication event independent from that which created the insect RD gene cluster. Analysis of embryonic RD gene expression in two endopterygotan insects, A. mellifera and D. melanogaster, did not show evidence for coordinated gene expression, therefore while the functional significance of this gene cluster remains unknown its maintenance during insect evolution implies some functional significance to the cluster.",2008,"Elizabeth J Duncan, Megan J Wilson, James M Smith, Peter K Dearden, Elizabeth J Duncan, Megan J Wilson, James M Smith, Peter K Dearden"
Circadian regulation of response to oxidative stress in Drosophila melanogaster,18627767,10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.011,"Circadian rhythms are fundamental biological phenomena generated by molecular genetic mechanisms known as circadian clocks. There is increasing evidence that circadian synchronization of physiological and cellular processes contribute to the wellness of organisms, curbing pathologies such as cancer and premature aging. Therefore, there is a need to understand how circadian clocks orchestrate interactions between the organism's internal processes and the environment. Here, we explore the nexus between the clock and oxidative stress susceptibility in Drosophila melanogaster. We exposed flies to acute oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and determined that mortality rates were dependent on time at which exposure occurred during the day/night cycle. The daily susceptibility rhythm was abolished in flies with a null mutation in the core clock gene period (per) abrogating clock function. Furthermore, lack of per increased susceptibility to H(2)O(2) compared to wild-type flies, coinciding with enhanced generation of mitochondrial H(2)O(2) and decreased catalase activity due to oxidative damage. Taken together, our data suggest that the circadian clock gene period is essential for maintaining a robust anti-oxidative defense.",2008,"Natraj Krishnan, Andrew J Davis, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz, Natraj Krishnan, Andrew J Davis, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"
Extraembryonic development in insects and the acrobatics of blastokinesis,18082679,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.11.004,"Extraembryonic development is familiar to mouse researchers, but the term is largely unknown among insect developmental geneticists. This is not surprising, as the model system Drosophila melanogaster has an extremely reduced extraembryonic component, the amnioserosa. In contrast, most insects retain the ancestral complement of two distinct extraembryonic membranes, amnion and serosa. These membranes are involved in several key morphogenetic events at specific developmental stages. The events of anatrepsis and katatrepsis--collectively referred to as blastokinesis--are specific to hemimetabolous insects. Corresponding events in holometabolous insects are simplified and lack formal names. All insects retain dorsal closure, which has been well studied in Drosophila. This review aims to resurrect both the terminology and awareness of insect extraembryonic development--which were last common currency in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries--as a number of recent studies have identified essential components of these events, through RNA interference of developmental genes and ectopic hormonal treatments. As much remains unknown, this topic offers opportunities for research on tissue specification, the regulation of cell shape changes and tissue interactions during morphogenesis, tracing the origins and final fates of cell and tissue lineages, and ascertaining the membranes' functions between morphogenetic events.",2008,"Kristen A Panfilio, Kristen A Panfilio"
Alternative promoter usage generates multiple evolutionarily conserved isoforms of Drosophila DOA kinase,18327787,10.1002/dvg.20374,"The unique LAMMER (or Clk) protein kinase of Drosophila is encoded at the Doa locus. To better understand the pleiotropic effects of Doa mutations, we describe the structure and expression of the multiple RNA and protein products of the locus, as well as their evolutionary conservation among Drosophila. The gene produces at least six different protein isoforms, primarily through alternative promoter usage, generating kinases with virtually identical catalytic domains but variable N-terminal noncatalytic domains. The single known alternative splicing event generates a kinase with the insertion of six additional amino-acids in the catalytic domain. Two independent predicted genes nested within Doa introns actually encode additional alternative N-termini of the locus. An alternative polyadenylation site utilized exclusively during early embryogenesis generates a transcript with a short half-life, apparently to ensure a ""burst"" of kinase expression at the onset of development. Ecdysone induction of Doa transcripts affects all isoforms during pupariation. Finally, extensive conservation of amino-acid sequences of both the catalytic and N-terminal noncatalytic exons observed in alignments between D. melanogaster exons and the genome sequences of 11 other Drosophila species suggest that the multiple isoforms serve important and nonredundant functions.",2008,"Arlette Kpebe, Leonard Rabinow, Arlette Kpebe, Leonard Rabinow"
"RanBPM regulates cell shape, arrangement, and capacity of the female germline stem cell niche in Drosophila melanogaster",18762575,10.1083/jcb.200711046,"Experiments in cultured cells with Ran-binding protein M (RanBPM) suggest that it links cell surface receptors and cell adhesion proteins. In this study, we undertake a genetic study of RanBPM function in the germline stem cell (GSC) niche of Drosophila melanogaster ovaries. We find that two RanBPM isoforms are produced from alternatively spliced transcripts, the longer of which is specifically enriched in the GSC niche, a cluster of somatic cells that physically anchors GSCs and expresses signals that maintain GSC fate. Loss of the long isoform from the niche causes defects in niche organization and cell size and increases the number of GSCs attached to the niche. In genetic mosaics for a null RanBPM allele, we find a strong bias for GSC attachment to mutant cap cells and observe abnormal accumulation of the adherens junction component Armadillo (beta-catenin) and the membrane skeletal protein Hu-li tai shao in mutant terminal filament cells. These results implicate RanBPM in the regulation of niche capacity and adhesion.",2008,"David A Dansereau, Paul Lasko, David A Dansereau, Paul Lasko"
Unprotected Drosophila melanogaster telomeres activate the spindle assembly checkpoint,18246067,10.1038/ng.2007.64,"In both yeast and mammals, uncapped telomeres activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and undergo end-to-end fusion. Previous work has shown that the Drosophila HOAP protein, encoded by the caravaggio (cav) gene, is required to prevent telomeric fusions. Here we show that HOAP-depleted telomeres activate both the DDR and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The cell cycle arrest elicited by the DDR was alleviated by mutations in mei-41 (encoding ATR), mus304 (ATRIP), grp (Chk1) and rad50 but not by mutations in tefu (ATM). The SAC was partially overridden by mutations in zw10 (also known as mit(1)15) and bubR1, and also by mutations in mei-41, mus304, rad50, grp and tefu. As expected from SAC activation, the SAC proteins Zw10, Zwilch, BubR1 and Cenp-meta (Cenp-E) accumulated at the kinetochores of cav mutant cells. Notably, BubR1 also accumulated at cav mutant telomeres in a mei-41-, mus304-, rad50-, grp- and tefu-dependent manner. Our results collectively suggest that recruitment of BubR1 by dysfunctional telomeres inhibits Cdc20-APC function, preventing the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.",2008,"Mariarosaria MusarÃ², Laura Ciapponi, Barbara Fasulo, Maurizio Gatti, Giovanni Cenci, Mariarosaria MusarÃ², Laura Ciapponi, Barbara Fasulo, Maurizio Gatti, Giovanni Cenci"

However, there are examples of Wolbachia that exist in nature that seem to induce no reproductive parasitism trait and yet are able to invade populations. We demonstrate a fitness benefit for Wolbachia-infected insects that may explain this paradox. Drosophila melanogaster flies infected with Wolbachia are less susceptible to mortality induced by a range of RNA viruses. The antiviral protection associated with Wolbachia infection might be exploited in future strategies to reduce transmission of pathogens by insects.",2008,"Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson, Lauren M Hedges, Jeremy C Brownlie, Scott L O'Neill, Karyn N Johnson"
Porin isoform 2 has a different localization in Drosophila melanogaster ovaries than porin 1,18686020,10.1007/s10863-008-9149-7,"Eukaryotic porins or VDACs are a class of transmembrane proteins mainly localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane, whose function is to allow the diffusion of metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondrion. In Drosophila melanogaster, as in other organisms, a small family of genes encoding porins has been discovered from the sequence of the genome. It is of general interest to understand whether these genes represent functional entities or not, and whether their product is associated to any particular tissue. In previous work we reported about the transcriptional and translational analysis of porin 1 and porin 2, and we proposed the specific presence of the latter in spermatozoa of the fly. In this paper we performed real time RT-PCR quantification of porin 1 and porin 2 transcripts in germ cells of the fly. It indicates that Porin 1 is abundantly expressed in both male and female tissues; Porin 2 instead, is very abundant in testis and it is present in ovaries as well, but in a small amount. The immuno-histological stain of ovaries shows that Porin isoform 1 is selectively targeted to follicular cells while Porin isoform 2 is present in mitochondria of the epithelial sheath cells of the ovariole.

A peripheral pacemaker drives the circadian rhythm of synaptic boutons in Drosophila independently of synaptic activity,18688648,10.1007/s00441-008-0670-0,"Circadian rhythms in the morphology of neurons have been demonstrated in the fly Drosophila melanogaster. One such rhythm is characterized by changes in the size of synaptic boutons of an identified flight motor neuron, with larger boutons during the day compared with those at night. A more detailed temporal resolution of this rhythm shows here that boutons grow at a time of increased locomotor activity during the morning but become gradually smaller during the day and second period of increased locomotor activity in the evening. We have experimentally manipulated the synaptic activity of the fly during short periods of the day to investigate whether changes in bouton size might be a consequence of the different levels of synaptic activity associated with the locomotion rhythm of the fly. In the late night and early morning, when the flies normally have an intense period of locomotion, the boutons grow independently of whether the flies are active or completely paralyzed. Bouton size is not affected by sleep-deprivation during the early night. The cycle in bouton size persists for 2 days even in decapitated flies, which do not move, reinforcing the notion that it is largely independent of synaptic activity, and showing that a pacemaker other than the main biological clock can drive it.",2008,"Kerstin I Mehnert, Rafael Cantera, Kerstin I Mehnert, Rafael Cantera"

Additionally, TcNDPK1 is capable of degrading Trypanosoma cruzi genomic DNA. ATP or ADP did not affect the nuclease activity, while the absence of Mg2+ completely inhibits this activity. NDPK and nuclease activities were inhibited at the same temperature, suggesting the presence of related catalytic sites. Furthermore, phenogram analysis showed that TcNDPK1 is close to Drosophila melanogaster and human NDPKs.

Measuring mRNA stability during early Drosophila embryogenesis,19111183,10.1016/S0076-6879(08)02616-5,"Maternal mRNAs play a major role in directing early Drosophila melanogaster development, and thus, precise posttranscriptional regulation of these messages is imperative for normal embryogenesis. Although initially abundant on egg deposition, a subset of these maternal mRNAs is targeted for destruction during the first 2 to 3 h of embryogenesis. In this chapter, we describe molecular methods to determine the kinetics and mechanisms of maternal mRNA decay in the early D. melanogaster embryo. We show how both unfertilized eggs and fertilized embryos can be used to identify maternal mRNAs destined for degradation, to explain changes in decay kinetics over time, and to uncover the molecular mechanisms of targeted maternal mRNA turnover. In the first section, we explore the methods and outcomes of measuring decay on a ""gene-by-gene"" basis, which involves examination of a small number of transcripts by Northern blotting, RNA dot blotting, and real-time RT-PCR. In the second section, we provide a comprehensive examination of the applications of microarray technology to study global changes in maternal mRNA decay during early development.

Studying the functional conservation of cis-regulatory modules and their transcriptional output,18442418,10.1186/1471-2105-9-220,"Background:
      
    

    
      Cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) are distinct, genomic regions surrounding the target gene that can independently activate the promoter to drive transcription. The activation of a CRM is controlled by the binding of a certain combination of transcription factors (TFs). It would be of great benefit if the transcriptional output mediated by a specific CRM could be predicted. Of equal benefit would be identifying in silico a specific CRM as the driver of the expression in a specific tissue or situation. We extend a recently developed biochemical modeling approach to manage both prediction tasks. Given a set of TFs, their protein concentrations, and the positions and binding strengths of each of the TFs in a putative CRM, the model predicts the transcriptional output of the gene. Our approach predicts the location of the regulating CRM by using predicted TF binding sites in regions near the gene as input to the model and searching for the region that yields a predicted transcription rate most closely matching the known rate.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we show the ability of the model on the example of one of the CRMs regulating the eve gene, MSE2. A model trained on the MSE2 in D. melanogaster was applied to the surrounding sequence of the eve gene in seven other Drosophila species. The model successfully predicts the correct MSE2 location and output in six out of eight Drosophila species we examine.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      The model is able to generalize from D. melanogaster to other Drosophila species and accurately predicts the location and transcriptional output of MSE2 in those species. However, we also show that the current model is not specific enough to function as a genome-wide CRM scanner, because it incorrectly predicts other genomic regions to be MSE2s.",2008,"Denis C Bauer, Timothy L Bailey, Denis C Bauer, Timothy L Bailey"
"Sensory mechanisms controlling the timing of larval developmental and behavioral transitions require the Drosophila DEG/ENaC subunit, Pickpocket1",18674528,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.07.003,"Growth of multicellular organisms proceeds through a series of precisely timed developmental events requiring coordination between gene expression, behavioral changes, and environmental conditions. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, the essential midthird instar transition from foraging (feeding) to wandering (non-feeding) behavior occurs prior to pupariation and metamorphosis. The timing of this key transition is coordinated with larval growth and size, but physiological mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. Results presented here show that Drosophila larvae associate specific environmental conditions, such as temperature, with food in order to enact appropriate foraging strategies. The transition from foraging to wandering behavior is associated with a striking reversal in the behavioral responses to food-associated stimuli that begins early in the third instar, well before food exit. Genetic manipulations disrupting expression of the Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel subunit, Pickpocket1(PPK1) or function of PPK1 peripheral sensory neurons caused defects in the timing of these behavioral transitions. Transient inactivation experiments demonstrated that sensory input from PPK1 neurons is required during a critical period early in the third instar to influence this developmental transition. Results demonstrate a key role for the PPK1 sensory neurons in regulation of important behavioral transitions associated with developmental progression of larvae from foraging to wandering stage.",2008,"Joshua A Ainsley, Myung Jun Kim, Lauren J Wegman, Janette M Pettus, Wayne A Johnson, Joshua A Ainsley, Myung Jun Kim, Lauren J Wegman, Janette M Pettus, Wayne A Johnson"

We review here our current knowledge on drosophila viruses. A diverse set of RNA viruses belonging to several families (Rhabdoviridae, Dicistroviridae, Birnaviridae, Reoviridae, Errantiviridae) has been reported in D. melanogaster. By contrast, no DNA virus has been recovered up to now. The drosophila viruses represent powerful tools to study virus-cell interactions in vivo. Analysis of the literature however reveals that for many of them, important gaps exist in our understanding of their replication cycle, genome organization, morphology or pathogenesis.

Preservation of genes involved in sterol metabolism in cholesterol auxotrophs: facts and hypotheses,18682733,10.1371/journal.pone.0002883,"Background:
      
    

    
      It is known that primary sequences of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis are well conserved in organisms that produce sterols de novo. However, we provide evidence for a preservation of the corresponding genes in two animals unable to synthesize cholesterol (auxotrophs): Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.
    

    
  


        Principal findings:
      
    

    
      We have been able to detect bona fide orthologs of several ERG genes in both organisms using a series of complementary approaches. We have detected strong sequence divergence between the orthologs of the nematode and of the fruitfly; they are also very divergent with respect to the orthologs in organisms able to synthesize sterols de novo (prototrophs). Interestingly, the orthologs in both the nematode and the fruitfly are still under selective pressure. It is possible that these genes, which are not involved in cholesterol synthesis anymore, have been recruited to perform different new functions. We propose a more parsimonious way to explain their accelerated evolution and subsequent stabilization. The products of ERG genes in prototrophs might be involved in several biological roles, in addition to sterol synthesis. In the case of the nematode and the fruitfly, the relevant genes would have lost their ancestral function in cholesterogenesis but would have retained the other function(s), which keep them under pressure.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      By exploiting microarray data we have noticed a strong expressional correlation between the orthologs of ERG24 and ERG25 in D. melanogaster and genes encoding factors involved in intracellular protein trafficking and folding and with Start1 involved in ecdysteroid synthesis. These potential functional connections are worth being explored not only in Drosophila, but also in Caenorhabditis as well as in sterol prototrophs.",2008,"Giovanna Vinci, Xuhua Xia, Reiner A Veitia, Giovanna Vinci, Xuhua Xia, Reiner A Veitia"
Reduction of drosopterin content caused by a 45-nt insertion in Henna pre-mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster,18677598,10.1007/s11427-008-0089-6,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase is assumed to be a key enzyme in drosopterin metabolism, but direct in vivo evidence to support this hypothesis is still absent. In the present study, we found a new natural recessive purple eye mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, Hn ( bp ), which was a 45-nt insertion mutant in the second exon of Henna. The insertion resulted in a predicted protein with 15 additional amino acids as compared to the wild-type protein. Further analysis of protein structure showed that the predicted mutant protein probably had two more beta-sheets, which may cause instability of two alpha-helices near the catalytic centre of the enzyme in the Biopterin-Hydroxyl binding domain. Hn ( bp ) mutant showed eye color defect with decrease of mRNA level, as well as drosopterin content reduction. The drosopterin defect could be fully rescued by expression of wild type Henna in the Hn ( bp ) background by GMR-GAL4 UAS-Henna/UAS-Henna:Hn ( bp )/Hn ( bp ) transgenic line. All taken together, it can be concluded that the mutation in Henna is responsible for drosopterin reduction in mutant Hn ( bp ), which provides key in vivo evidence to support the hypothesis that Henna is involved in drosopterin synthesis.",2008,"Qin Wang, Chunjiang Zhao, Lihua Bai, Xuemei Deng, Changxin Wu, Qin Wang, Chunjiang Zhao, Lihua Bai, Xuemei Deng, Changxin Wu"

Mutants exhibit endogenous seizure-like activity, indicating altered neuronal excitability. However, at the synaptic level, stj larval neuromuscular junctions exhibit approximately fourfold reduction in synaptic release compared with controls stemming from a reduced release probability at these synapses. These defects likely stem from destabilization of Cacophony (Cac), the primary presynaptic alpha(1) subunit in D. melanogaster.

dSETDB1 and SU(VAR)3-9 sequentially function during germline-stem cell differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,18493619,10.1371/journal.pone.0002234,"Germline-stem cells (GSCs) produce gametes and are thus true ""immortal stem cells"".

As germline cysts differentiate into egg chambers, the dSETDB1 function is gradually taken over by another H3-K9-specific methyltransferase, SU(VAR)3-9. Loss-of-function mutations in dsetdb1 or Su(var)3-9 abolish both H3K9me3 and heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) signals from the anterior germarium and the developing egg chambers, respectively, and cause localization of H3K9me3 away from DNA-dense regions in most posterior germarium cells.

Both of these concepts require that students understand not only inheritance but also the principles of protein structure and function. A genetics laboratory exercise was developed that combines study of some extensions of Mendelian inheritance with practice in manipulating Drosophila melanogaster and scoring subtle and variable phenotypes. Students analyze Drosophila with mutations that demonstrate some extensions of Mendelian inheritance: temperature sensitivity, variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance, multiple alleles, dosage compensation, and gene dosage effect. The phenotypes in some of these mutants differ from individual to individual and are difficult to discern; thus, students also gain experience in investigating challenging phenotypes.

Body size was increased by overexpression of sNPF or sNPFR1. The fat body of sNPF mutant Drosophila had downregulated Akt, nuclear localized FOXO, upregulated translational inhibitor 4E-BP and reduced cell size.

Term-tissue specific models for prediction of gene ontology biological processes using transcriptional profiles of aging in drosophila melanogaster,18307794,10.1186/1471-2105-9-129,"Background:
      
    

    
      Predictive classification on the base of gene expression profiles appeared recently as an attractive strategy for identifying the biological functions of genes.

      This study focused on using support vector machines (SVM) to predict GO biological processes from individual or multiple-tissue transcriptional profiles of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Ten-fold cross validation was implemented to evaluate the prediction. One-tail Fisher's exact test was conducted on each cross validation and multiple testing was addressed using BH FDR procedure. The results showed that, of the 148 pursued GO biological processes, fifteen terms each had at least one model with FDR-adjusted p-value (Adj.p) <0.05 and six had the values between 0.05 and 0.25.

The same result was observed with other odors that stimulate other types of olfactory receptor neuron in the maxillary palp. When an antennal olfactory receptor was genetically introduced in the maxillary palp, the fly interpreted a new odor as a sweet-enhancing smell.

"Metabolism of imidacloprid and DDT by P450 CYP6G1 expressed in cell cultures of Nicotiana tabacum suggests detoxification of these insecticides in Cyp6g1-overexpressing strains of Drosophila melanogaster, leading to resistance",17912692,10.1002/ps.1472,"Background:
      
    

    
      With the worldwide use of insecticides, an increasing number of pest insect species have evolved target-site or metabolism-based resistance towards some of these compounds. The resulting decreased efficacy of pesticides threatens human welfare by its impact on crop safety and further disease transmission. Environmental concentrations of some insecticides are so high that even natural populations of non-target, non-pest organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster Meig. have been selected for resistance. Cyp6g1-overexpressing strains of D. melanogaster are resistant to a wide range of chemically diverse insecticides, including DDT and imidacloprid. However, up to now there has been no evidence that the CYP6G1 enzyme metabolises any of these compounds.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here it is shown, by heterologous expression in cell suspension cultures of Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco), that CYP6G1 is capable of converting DDT (20 microg per cell culture assay) by dechlorination to DDD (18% of applied amount in 48 h), and imidacloprid (400 microg) mainly by hydroxylation to 4-hydroxyimidacloprid and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid (58 and 19% respectively in 48 h).
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Thus, the gap between the supposed resistance gene Cyp6g1 and the observed resistance phenomenon was closed by the evidence that CYP6G1 is capable of metabolising at least two insecticides.",2008,"Nicole Joussen, David G Heckel, Matthias Haas, Ingolf Schuphan, Burkhard Schmidt, Nicole Joussen, David G Heckel, Matthias Haas, Ingolf Schuphan, Burkhard Schmidt"
Genomic P elements content of a wild M' strain of Drosophila melanogaster: KP elements do not always function as type II repressor elements,18379135,10.1266/ggs.83.67,"The P element is one of the best-studied DNA transposons as a model system to study evolution of mobile DNAs. The P element is a causative factor for P-M hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster and the P-M phenotype (P, Q, or M) has been thought to reflect genomic P elements content. Recent survey of natural populations showed that full-size P (FP) and KP elements are predominant in almost all current populations, irrespective of their phenotype variation. It was also suggested that some P elements are functionally inactive and their inactivation plays an important role in determining P-M phenotype. In order to know how the genomic P elements are inactivated, we characterized molecular features and insertion sites of them in an M' strain. We isolated 20 P elements, one FP, 15 KP, and four other internally deleted defective elements, all of which appeared thoroughly inactive. These FP and KP elements had canonical sequences in each case, but no mutations abolishing their function. In addition, they were mostly located in or within the vicinity of presumably active genes. Our results suggest that inactivation of P elements is associated with neither mutations nor constitutional suppression by heterochromatinization in M' strains and that only a few elements inserted in some special chromosomal regions are likely to be involved in determination of the phenotype of individual flies. Existence of many copies of canonical, but inactive, KP elements in the M' strain is inconsistent with the assumption that type II repression of the KP element is the main reason for its increase in the wild populations of D. melanogaster.",2008,"Tomokazu Fukui, Yutaka Inoue, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Masanobu Itoh, Tomokazu Fukui, Yutaka Inoue, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Masanobu Itoh"

The impact of founder events on chromosomal variability in multiply mating species,18511425,10.1093/molbev/msn124,"In species with heterogametic males, the relative levels of X chromosome versus autosome diversity hold key information about the evolutionary forces at work in a population. It has been shown that population size changes alter the ratio of X linked to autosomal (X/A) variation, with population size reductions and recent bottlenecks leading to decreased X/A diversity ratios. Here we use theory and simulation to investigate a separate demographic effect-that of founder events involving multiply mated females-and find that it leads to much stronger reductions in X/A diversity ratios than are produced by simple population size changes. Investigating the potential of this process to account for sharply reduced X-linked diversity in European Drosophila melanogaster, we find that this model yields predictions that are compatible with the empirical data.",2008,"John E Pool, Rasmus Nielsen, John E Pool, Rasmus Nielsen"
"LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Silnoon, a monocarboxylate transporter, in Drosophila melanogaster",18838551,10.1083/jcb.200807052,"Silnoon (Sln) is a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) that mediates active transport of metabolic monocarboxylates such as butyrate and lactate. Here, we identify Sln as a novel LKB1-interacting protein using Drosophila melanogaster genetic modifier screening. Sln expression does not affect cell cycle progression or cell size but specifically enhances LKB1-dependent apoptosis and tissue size reduction. Conversely, down-regulation of Sln suppresses LKB1-dependent apoptosis, implicating Sln as a downstream mediator of LKB1. The kinase activity of LKB1 induces apical trafficking of Sln in polarized cells, and LKB1-dependent Sln trafficking is crucial for triggering apoptosis induced by extracellular butyrate. Given that LKB1 functions to control both epithelial polarity and cell death, we propose Sln is an important downstream target of LKB1.",2008,"Cholsoon Jang, Gina Lee, Jongkyeong Chung, Cholsoon Jang, Gina Lee, Jongkyeong Chung"
Integrating Gene Expression Data Into Genomic Prediction,30858865,10.3389/fgene.2019.00126,"Gene expression profiles potentially hold valuable information for the prediction of breeding values and phenotypes. In this study, the utility of transcriptome data for phenotype prediction was tested with 185 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster for nine traits in two sexes. We incorporated the transcriptome data into genomic prediction via two methods: GTBLUP and GRBLUP, both combining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcriptome data. The genotypic data was used to construct the common additive genomic relationship, which was used in genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) or jointly in a linear mixed model with a transcriptome-based linear kernel (GTBLUP), or with a transcriptome-based Gaussian kernel (GRBLUP). We studied the predictive ability of the models and discuss a concept of ""omics-augmented broad sense heritability"" for the multi-omics era. For most traits, GRBLUP and GBLUP provided similar predictive abilities, but GRBLUP explained more of the phenotypic variance. There was only one trait (olfactory perception to Ethyl Butyrate in females) in which the predictive ability of GRBLUP (0.23) was significantly higher than the predictive ability of GBLUP (0.21). Our results suggest that accounting for transcriptome data has the potential to improve genomic predictions if transcriptome data can be included on a larger scale.",2019,"Zhengcao Li, Ning Gao, Johannes W R Martini, Henner Simianer, Zhengcao Li, Ning Gao, Johannes W R Martini, Henner Simianer"
Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster anti-ovarian response to honey bee queen mandibular pheromone,30159981,10.1111/imb.12531,"Queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) is a potent reproductive signal to which honey bee workers respond by suppressing their ovaries and adopting alloparental roles within the colony. This anti-ovarian effect of QMP on workers can, surprisingly, be induced in other insects, including fruit flies, in which females exposed to synthetic QMP develop smaller ovaries with fewer eggs. In this study, we use the Drosophila melanogaster model to identify the components of synthetic QMP required for the anti-ovarian effect. We found that virgin females respond strongly to 9-oxo-2-decenoic acid and 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10HDA), suggesting that the decenoic acid components of QMP are essential for the anti-ovarian response. Further, a nuclear factor of activated T-cells reporter system revealed neurones expressing the olfactory receptors Or-56a, Or-49b and Or-98a are activated by QMP in the antenna. In addition, we used olfactory receptor GAL4 drivers and a neuronal activator (a neuronal activating bacterial sodium channel) to test whether the candidate neurones are potential labelled lines for a decenoic acid response. We identified Or-49b as a potential candidate receiver of the 10HDA signal. Finally, the anti-ovarian response to synthetic QMP is not mediated by decreasing the titre of the reproductive hormones ecdysone and juvenile hormone.",2019,"K C Galang, J R Croft, G J Thompson, A Percival-Smith, K C Galang, J R Croft, G J Thompson, A Percival-Smith"
Recombinant deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster can improve gemcitabine based combined gene/chemotherapy for targeting cancer cells,30903745,10.17305/bjbms.2019.4136,"A recombinant deoxyribonucleoside kinase from Drosophila melanogaster with a deletion of the last 20 amino acid residues (named DmdNK?C20) was hypothesized as a potential therapeutic tool for gene therapy due to its broad substrate specificity and better catalytic efficiency towards nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of DmdNK?C20 for sensitizing human cancer cell lines to gemcitabine and to further investigate its role in reversal of acquired drug resistance in gemcitabine-resistant cancer cell line. The DmdNK?C20 gene was delivered to three different cancer cell lines, including breast, colon and liver cancer cells, using lipid-mediated transfection reagent.

Multiple genetic loci affect place learning and memory performance in Drosophila melanogaster,31095869,10.1111/gbb.12581,"Learning and memory are critical functions for all animals, giving individuals the ability to respond to changes in their environment. Within populations, individuals vary, however the mechanisms underlying this variation in performance are largely unknown. Thus, it remains to be determined what genetic factors cause an individual to have high learning ability and what factors determine how well an individual will remember what they have learned. To genetically dissect learning and memory performance, we used the Drosophila synthetic population resource (DSPR), a multiparent mapping resource in the model system Drosophila melanogaster, consisting of a large set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that naturally vary in these and other traits. Fruit flies can be trained in a ""heat box"" to learn to remain on one side of a chamber (place learning) and can remember this (place memory) over short timescales. Using this paradigm, we measured place learning and memory for ~49 000 individual flies from over 700 DSPR RILs. We identified 16 different loci across the genome that significantly affect place learning and/or memory performance, with 5 of these loci affecting both traits. To identify transcriptomic differences associated with performance, we performed RNA-Seq on pooled samples of seven high performing and seven low performing RILs for both learning and memory and identified hundreds of genes with differences in expression in the two sets. Integrating our transcriptomic results with the mapping results allowed us to identify nine promising candidate genes, advancing our understanding of the genetic basis underlying natural variation in learning and memory performance.",2019,"Patricka A Williams-Simon, Christopher Posey, Samuel Mitchell, Enoch Ng'oma, James A Mrkvicka, Troy Zars, Elizabeth G King, Patricka A Williams-Simon, Christopher Posey, Samuel Mitchell, Enoch Ng'oma, James A Mrkvicka, Troy Zars, Elizabeth G King"
A conserved CAF40-binding motif in metazoan NOT4 mediates association with the CCR4-NOT complex,30692204,10.1101/gad.320952.118,"The multisubunit CCR4-NOT mRNA deadenylase complex plays important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. The NOT4 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a stable component of the CCR4-NOT complex in yeast but does not copurify with the human or Drosophila melanogaster complex. Here we show that the C-terminal regions of human and D. melanogaster NOT4 contain a conserved sequence motif that directly binds the CAF40 subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex (CAF40-binding motif [CBM]). In addition, nonconserved sequences flanking the CBM also contact other subunits of the complex. Crystal structures of the CBM-CAF40 complex reveal a mutually exclusive binding surface for NOT4 and Roquin or Bag of marbles mRNA regulatory proteins. Furthermore, CAF40 depletion or structure-guided mutagenesis to disrupt the NOT4-CAF40 interaction impairs the ability of NOT4 to elicit decay of tethered reporter mRNAs in cells. Together with additional sequence analyses, our results reveal the molecular basis for the association of metazoan NOT4 with the CCR4-NOT complex and show that it deviates substantially from yeast.

Identification of Genes Required for Apical Protein Trafficking in Drosophila Photoreceptor Cells,31649044,10.1534/g3.119.400635,"Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor cells are highly polarized epithelial cells.

The proteoglycan Eyes shut (Eys) is secreted through the apical membrane into an inter-rhabdomeral space. Rh1, Crb, and Eys are essential for the development of photoreceptor cells, normal vision, and photoreceptor cell survival. Human orthologs of all three proteins have been linked to retinal degenerative diseases.

We found 28 genes that have an effect on the localization and/or levels of these apical proteins and analyzed several factors in more detail. We show that the Arf GEF protein Sec71 is required for biosynthetic traffic of both apical and basolateral proteins, that the exocyst complex and the microtubule-based motor proteins dynein and kinesin promote the secretion of Eys and Rh1, and that Syntaxin 7/Avalanche controls the endocytosis of Rh1, Eys, and Crb.",2019,"Azadeh Laffafian, Ulrich Tepass, Azadeh Laffafian, Ulrich Tepass"
Trichoderma atroviride from Predator to Prey: Role of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Tmk3 in Fungal Chemical Defense against Fungivory by Drosophila melanogaster Larvae,30389761,10.1128/AEM.01825-18,"The response to injury represents an important strategy for animals and plants to survive mechanical damage and predation. Plants respond to injury by activating a defense response that includes the production of an important variety of compounds that help them withstand predator attack and recover from mechanical injury (MI). Similarly, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride responds to MI by strongly modifying its transcriptional profile and producing asexual reproduction structures (conidia). Here, we analyzed whether the response to MI in T. atroviride is related to a possible predator defense mechanism from a metabolic perspective. We found that the production of specific groups of secondary metabolites increases in response to MI but is reduced after fungivory by Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We further show that fungivory results in repression of the expression of genes putatively involved in the regulation of secondary metabolite production in T. atroviride Activation of secondary metabolite production appears to depend on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Tmk3. Interestingly, D. melanogaster larvae preferred to feed on a tmk3 gene replacement mutant rather than on the wild-type strain. Consumption of the mutant strain, however, resulted in increased larval mortality.IMPORTANCE Fungi, like other organisms, have natural predators, including fungivorous nematodes and arthropods that use them as an important food source. Thus, they require mechanisms to detect and respond to injury. Trichoderma atroviride responds to mycelial injury by rapidly regenerating its hyphae and developing asexual reproduction structures. Whether this injury response is associated with attack by fungivorous insects is unknown. Therefore, determining the possible conservation of a defense mechanism to predation in T. atroviride and plants and elucidating the mechanisms involved in the establishment of this response is of major interest.

Elevated DNA damage was observed in the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies. dLipin dysfunction induced accumulation of cells in S phase and significantly reduced the number of mitotic cells, indicating DNA damage-induced activation of the G2/M checkpoint. Reduced expression of cyclin B, which is critical for the G2 to M transition, was observed in the margin of the wing imaginal disc of dLipin-knockdown flies.

Diagnostic concentrations (susceptible strain LC95, 4 ? LC95, and 16 ? LC95) were used to evaluate percentage survival of the field flies relative to the susceptible Canton-S strain. Resistance to zeta-cypermethrin, acetamiprid, and malathion, but not to spinosad and spinetoram, was observed in the field-collected flies.

An Improved Method for Measuring Absolute Metabolite Concentrations in Small Biofluid or Tissue Samples,30757904,10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00773,"The measurement of absolute metabolite concentrations in small samples remains a significant analytical challenge. This is particularly the case when the sample volume is only a few microliters or less and cannot be determined accurately via direct measurement. We previously developed volume determination with two standards (VDTS) as a method to address this challenge for biofluids. As a proof-of-principle, we applied VDTS to NMR spectra of polar metabolites in the hemolymph (blood) of the tiny yet powerful genetic model Drosophila melanogaster. This showed that VDTS calculation of absolute metabolite concentrations in fed versus starved Drosophila larvae is more accurate than methods utilizing normalization to total spectral signal. Here, we introduce paired VDTS (pVDTS), an improved VDTS method for biofluids and solid tissues that implements the statistical power of paired control and experimental replicates. pVDTS utilizes new equations that also include a correction for dilution errors introduced by the variable surface wetness of solid samples.

It acts as a critical co-factor of many enzymes that play key roles in diverse cellular processes. The present study attempts to investigate the regulatory functions decisively controlling copper trafficking during development and aging of the Drosophila model system. Hence, through engagement of the GAL4/UAS genetic platform and RNAi technology, we herein examined the in vivo significance of Atox1 and CCS genes, products of which pivotally govern cellular copper trafficking in fly tissue pathophysiology. Specifically, we analyzed the systemic effects of their targeted downregulation on the eye, wing, neuronal cell populations and whole-body tissues of the fly. Our results reveal that, in contrast to the eye, suppression of their expression in the wing leads to a notable increase in the percentage of malformed organs observed. Furthermore, we show that Atox1 or CCS gene silencing in either neuronal or whole-body tissues can critically affect the viability and climbing capacity of transgenic flies, while their double-genetic targeting suggests a rather synergistic mode of action of the cognate protein products. Interestingly, pharmacological intervention with the anti-cancer drug cisplatin indicates the major contribution of CCS copper chaperone to cisplatin's cellular trafficking, and presumably to tumor resistance often acquired during chemotherapy. Altogether, it seems that Atox1 and CCS proteins serve as tissue/organ-specific principal regulators of physiological Drosophila development and aging, while their tissue-dependent downregulation can provide important insights for Atox1 and CCS potential exploitation as predictive gene biomarkers of cancer-cell chemotherapy responses.",2019,"Eleni I Theotoki, Athanassios D Velentzas, Stamatia A Katarachia, Nikos C Papandreou, Nikolas I Kalavros, Sofia N Pasadaki, Aikaterini F Giannopoulou, Panagiotis Giannios, Vassiliki A Iconomidou, Eumorphia G Konstantakou, Ema Anastasiadou, Issidora S Papassideri, Dimitrios J Stravopodis, Eleni I Theotoki, Athanassios D Velentzas, Stamatia A Katarachia, Nikos C Papandreou, Nikolas I Kalavros, Sofia N Pasadaki, Aikaterini F Giannopoulou, Panagiotis Giannios, Vassiliki A Iconomidou, Eumorphia G Konstantakou, Ema Anastasiadou, Issidora S Papassideri, Dimitrios J Stravopodis"

Gut yeasts do not improve desiccation survival in Drosophila melanogaster,31170408,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.103893,"A healthy gut microbiota generally improves the performance of its insect host. Although the effects can be specific to the species composition of the microbial community, the role of gut microbiota in determining water balance has not been well explored. We used axenic and gnotobiotic (reared with a known microbiota) Drosophila melanogaster to test three hypotheses about the effects of gut yeasts on the water balance of adult flies: 1) that gut yeasts would improve desiccation survival in adult flies; 2) that larval yeasts would improve adult desiccation survival; 3) that the effects would be species-specific, such that yeasts closely associated with D. melanogaster in nature are more likely to be beneficial than those rarely found in association with D. melanogaster. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae (often used in Drosophila cultures, but rarely associated with D. melanogaster in nature), Lachancea kluyveri (associated with some species of Drosophila, but not D. melanogaster), and Pichia kluyveri (associated with D. melanogaster in nature). Adult inoculation with yeasts had no effect on survival of desiccating conditions. Inoculation with P. kluyveri as larvae did not change desiccation survival in adults; however, rearing with L. kluyveri or S. cerevisiae reduced adult desiccation survival. We conclude that adult inoculation with gut yeasts has no impact on desiccation survival, but that rearing with yeasts can have either no or detrimental effect. The effects appear to be species-specific: P. kluyveri did not have a negative impact on desiccation tolerance, suggesting some level of co-adaptation with D. melanogaster. We note that S. cerevisiae may not be an appropriate species for studying the effects of gut yeasts on D. melanogaster.",2019,"Joanne M Tang, Yanira JimÃ©nez-Padilla, Marc-AndrÃ© Lachance, Brent J Sinclair"
Dissection of Drosophila melanogaster Flight Muscles for Omics Approaches,31680668,10.3791/60309,"Drosophila flight muscle is a powerful model to study diverse processes such as transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing, metabolism, and mechanobiology, which all influence muscle development and myofibrillogenesis. Omics data, such as those generated by mass spectrometry or deep sequencing, can provide important mechanistic insights into these biological processes. For such approaches, it is beneficial to analyze tissue-specific samples to increase both selectivity and specificity of the omics fingerprints. Here we present a protocol for dissection of fluorescent-labeled flight muscle from live pupae to generate highly enriched muscle samples for omics applications. We first describe how to dissect flight muscles at early pupal stages (<48 h after puparium formation [APF]), when the muscles are discernable by green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling. We then describe how to dissect muscles from late pupae (>48 h APF) or adults, when muscles are distinguishable under a dissecting microscope. The accompanying video protocol will make these technically demanding dissections more widely accessible to the muscle and Drosophila research communities. For RNA applications, we assay the quantity and quality of RNA that can be isolated at different time points and with different approaches. We further show that Bruno1 (Bru1) is necessary for a temporal shift in myosin heavy chain (Mhc) splicing, demonstrating that dissected muscles can be used for mRNA-Seq, mass spectrometry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) applications. This dissection protocol will help promote tissue-specific omics analyses and can be generally applied to study multiple biological aspects of myogenesis.",2019,"Shao-Yen Kao, Elena Nikonova, Keshika Ravichandran, Maria L Spletter, Shao-Yen Kao, Elena Nikonova, Keshika Ravichandran, Maria L Spletter"
The Immune Deficiency Pathway Regulates Metabolic Homeostasis in Drosophila,30902902,10.4049/jimmunol.1801632,"Immune and metabolic pathways collectively influence host responses to microbial invaders, and mutations in one pathway frequently disrupt activity in another. We used the Drosophila melanogaster model to characterize metabolic homeostasis in flies with modified immune deficiency (IMD) pathway activity. The IMD pathway is very similar to the mammalian TNF-Î± pathway, a key regulator of vertebrate immunity and metabolism. We found that persistent activation of IMD resulted in hyperglycemia, depleted fat reserves, and developmental delays, implicating IMD in metabolic regulation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that imd mutants weigh more, are hyperlipidemic, and have impaired glucose tolerance. To test the importance of metabolic regulation for host responses to bacterial infection, we challenged insulin pathway mutants with lethal doses of several Drosophila pathogens. We found that loss-of-function mutations in the insulin pathway impacted host responses to infection in a manner that depends on the route of infection and the identity of the infectious microbe. Combined, our results support a role for coordinated regulation of immune and metabolic pathways in host containment of microbial invaders.",2019,"Saeideh Davoodi, Anthony Galenza, Andrew Panteluk, Rujuta Deshpande, Meghan Ferguson, Savraj Grewal, Edan Foley, Saeideh Davoodi, Anthony Galenza, Andrew Panteluk, Rujuta Deshpande, Meghan Ferguson, Savraj Grewal, Edan Foley"
Unsupervised identification of the internal states that shape natural behavior,31768056,10.1038/s41593-019-0533-x,"Internal states shape stimulus responses and decision-making, but we lack methods to identify them. To address this gap, we developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males pattern their songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers three latent states underlying this behavior and is able to predict moment-to-moment variation in song-patterning decisions. These states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies, each of which is characterized by different mappings from feedback cues to song modes. We show that a pair of neurons previously thought to be command neurons for song production are sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal how animals compose behavior from previously unidentified internal states, which is a necessary step for quantitative descriptions of animal behavior that link environmental cues, internal needs, neuronal activity and motor outputs.",2019,"Adam J Calhoun, Jonathan W Pillow, Mala Murthy, Adam J Calhoun, Jonathan W Pillow, Mala Murthy"
Reproductive fitness of Drosophila is maximised by optimal developmental temperature,31064855,10.1242/jeb.202184,"Whether the character of developmental plasticity is adaptive or non-adaptive has often been a matter of controversy. Although thermal developmental plasticity has been studied in Drosophila for several traits, it is not entirely clear how it affects reproductive fitness. We, therefore, investigated how developmental temperature affects reproductive performance (early fecundity and egg-to-adult viability) of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster We tested competing hypotheses on the character of developmental thermal plasticity using a full-factorial design with three developmental and adulthood temperatures within the natural thermal range of this species. To account for potential intraspecific differences, we examined flies from tropical (India) and temperate (Slovakia) climate zones. Our results show that flies from both populations raised at an intermediate developmental temperature (25Â°C) have comparable or higher early fecundity and fertility at all tested adulthood temperatures, while lower (17Â°C) or higher developmental temperatures (29Â°C) did not entail any advantage under the tested thermal regimes. Importantly, the superior thermal performance of flies raised at 25Â°C is apparent even after taking two traits positively associated with reproductive output into account: body size and ovariole number. Thus, in D. melanogaster, development at a given temperature does not necessarily provide any advantage in this thermal environment in terms of reproductive fitness. Our findings strongly support the optimal developmental temperature hypothesis, which states that in different thermal environments, the highest fitness is achieved when an organism is raised at its optimal developmental temperature.",2019,"Peter Klepsatel, Thirnahalli Nagaraj Girish, Heinrich Dircksen, Martina GÃ¡likovÃ¡, Peter Klepsatel, Thirnahalli Nagaraj Girish, Heinrich Dircksen, Martina GÃ¡likovÃ¡"

Optimal searching behaviour generated intrinsically by the central pattern generator for locomotion,31674911,10.7554/eLife.50316,"Efficient searching for resources such as food by animals is key to their survival. It has been proposed that diverse animals from insects to sharks and humans adopt searching patterns that resemble a simple LÃ©vy random walk, which is theoretically optimal for 'blind foragers' to locate sparse, patchy resources. To test if such patterns are generated intrinsically, or arise via environmental interactions, we tracked free-moving Drosophila larvae with (and without) blocked synaptic activity in the brain, suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) and sensory neurons. In brain-blocked larvae, we found that extended substrate exploration emerges as multi-scale movement paths similar to truncated LÃ©vy walks. Strikingly, power-law exponents of brain/SOG/sensory-blocked larvae averaged 1.96, close to a theoretical optimum (Âµ ??2.0) for locating sparse resources.

A subset of brain neurons controls regurgitation in adult Drosophila melanogaster,31511344,10.1242/jeb.210724,"Taste is essential for animals to evaluate food quality and make important decisions about food choice and intake. How complex brains process sensory information to produce behavior is an essential question in the field of sensory neurobiology. Currently, little is known about higher-order taste circuits in the brain as compared with those of other sensory systems. Here, we used the common vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to screen for candidate neurons labeled by different transgenic GAL4 lines in controlling feeding behaviors. We found that activation of one line (VT041723-GAL4) produces 'proboscis holding' behavior (extrusion of the mouthpart without withdrawal). Further analysis showed that the proboscis holding phenotype indicates an aversive response, as flies pre-fed with either sucrose or water prior to neuronal activation exhibited regurgitation. Anatomical characterization of VT041723-GAL4-labeled neurons suggests that they receive sensory input from peripheral taste neurons. Overall, our study identifies a subset of brain neurons labeled by VT041723-GAL4 that may be involved in a taste circuit that controls regurgitation.",2019,"Yu-Chieh David Chen, Sameera Ahmad, Kush Amin, Anupama Dahanukar, Yu-Chieh David Chen, Sameera Ahmad, Kush Amin, Anupama Dahanukar"
Functional transcriptome analyses of Drosophila suzukii antennae reveal mating-dependent olfaction plasticity in females,30590188,10.1016/j.ibmb.2018.12.012,"Insect olfaction modulates basal behaviors and it is often influenced by the physiological condition of each individual such as the reproductive state. Olfactory plasticity can be achieved by modifications at both peripheral and central nervous system levels. Here we performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of the main olfactory organ, the antenna, to investigate how gene expression varies with female mating status in Drosophila suzukii, a destructive and invasive soft fruit pest. We observed a wide mating-induced up-regulation of chemosensory-related genes in females, especially odorant receptor (Or) genes. We then used a candidate gene approach to define the comprehensive dataset of antenna-expressed chemosensory receptors and binding proteins, which showed many similarities with Drosophila melanogaster. Candidate gene approach was also used to finely quantify differential expression at Or isoform level, suggesting post-mating transcriptional modulation of genes involved in the peripheral olfactory system. We identified 27 up-regulated Or transcripts encoded by 25 genes, seven of them were duplications specific to D. suzukii lineage. Post-mating olfactory modulation was further supported by electroantennogram recordings that showed a differential response according to mating status to one out of eight odors tested (isoamyl-acetate). Our study characterizes the transcriptional mechanisms driven by mating in D. suzukii female antennae.

Contribution of a natural polymorphism in protein kinase G modulates electroconvulsive seizure recovery in Drosophila melanogaster,29798846,10.1242/jeb.179747,"Drosophila melanogaster is a well-characterized model for neurological disorders and is widely used for investigating causes of altered neuronal excitability leading to seizure-like behavior. One method used to analyze behavioral output of neuronal perturbance is recording the time to locomotor recovery from an electroconvulsive shock. Based on this behavior, we sought to quantify seizure susceptibility in larval D. melanogaster with differences in the enzymatic activity levels of a major protein, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG, encoded by foraging, has two natural allelic variants and has previously been implicated in several important physiological characteristics including: foraging patterns, learning and memory, and environmental stress tolerance. The well-established NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway found in the fly, which potentially targets downstream K+ channel(s), ultimately impacts membrane excitability, leading to our hypothesis: altering PKG enzymatic activity modulates time to recovery from an electroconvulsive seizure. Our results show that by both genetically and pharmacologically increasing PKG enzymatic activity, we can decrease the locomotor recovery time from an electroconvulsive seizure in larval D. melanogaster.",2018,"Stephanie P Kelly, Monica G Risley, Leonor E Miranda, Ken Dawson-Scully"
"Diapause in Drosophila melanogaster - Photoperiodicity, cold tolerance and metabolites",29339232,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.01.003,"Unlike many insects where photoperiod per se induces diapause, reproductive arrest in Drosophila melanogaster adult females is observed at colder temperatures and can be enhanced by shorter photoperiods. Traditional experimental protocols raise flies at 25 Â°C from the larval stage and then the adults are placed at 12 Â°C for between 12 and 28 days. After 12 days diapause levels are usually higher than at 28 days, suggesting that the flies are in a cold induced quiescence, rather than a true diapause. By raising flies at more realistic lower temperatures, we observe quite dramatic and counter-intuitive effects on diapause, whose levels nevertheless correlate with various indices of cryoprotectant metabolites as well as resistance to chill shock. We also observe that photoperiodic effects are minimised when very small temperature oscillations associated with the light-dark incubator cycles are neutralised. Our results suggest that the reported photoperiodic component of fly diapause, at least in these strains, is mostly due to thermoperiodic rather than photoperiodic stimuli. In addition, the metabolite and chill shock analyses reveal that even by 12 days, flies are entering a state that is resistant to environmental stresses.",2018,"Ane Martin Anduaga, Dora Nagy, Rodolfo Costa, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Ane Martin Anduaga, Dora Nagy, Rodolfo Costa, Charalambos P Kyriacou"
High Throughput Measurement of Locomotor Sensitization to Volatilized Cocaine in Drosophila melanogaster,29459820,10.3389/fnmol.2018.00025,"Drosophila melanogaster can be used to identify genes with novel functional roles in neuronal plasticity induced by repeated consumption of addictive drugs. Behavioral sensitization is a relatively simple behavioral output of plastic changes that occur in the brain after repeated exposures to drugs of abuse. The development of screening procedures for genes that control behavioral sensitization has stalled due to a lack of high-throughput behavioral tests that can be used in genetically tractable organism, such as Drosophila. We have developed a new behavioral test, FlyBong, which combines delivery of volatilized cocaine (vCOC) to individually housed flies with objective quantification of their locomotor activity. There are two main advantages of FlyBong: it is high-throughput and it allows for comparisons of locomotor activity of individual flies before and after single or multiple exposures. At the population level, exposure to vCOC leads to transient and concentration-dependent increase in locomotor activity, representing sensitivity to an acute dose. A second exposure leads to further increase in locomotion, representing locomotor sensitization. We validate FlyBong by showing that locomotor sensitization at either the population or individual level is absent in the mutants for circadian genes period (per), Clock (Clk), and cycle (cyc). The locomotor sensitization that is present in timeless (tim) and pigment dispersing factor (pdf) mutant flies is in large part not cocaine specific, but derived from increased sensitivity to warm air. Circadian genes are not only integral part of the neural mechanism that is required for development of locomotor sensitization, but in addition, they modulate the intensity of locomotor sensitization as a function of the time of day. Motor-activating effects of cocaine are sexually dimorphic and require a functional dopaminergic transporter. FlyBong is a new and improved method for inducing and measuring locomotor sensitization to cocaine in individual Drosophila. Because of its high-throughput nature, FlyBong can be used in genetic screens or in selection experiments aimed at the unbiased identification of functional genes involved in acute or chronic effects of volatilized psychoactive substances.",2018,"Ana FiloÅ¡evi?, Sabina Al-Samarai, Rozi Andreti?

Nociceptive interneurons control modular motor pathways to promote escape behavior in Drosophila,29528286,10.7554/eLife.26016,"Rapid and efficient escape behaviors in response to noxious sensory stimuli are essential for protection and survival. Yet, how noxious stimuli are transformed to coordinated escape behaviors remains poorly understood. In Drosophila larvae, noxious stimuli trigger sequential body bending and corkscrew-like rolling behavior. We identified a population of interneurons in the nerve cord of Drosophila, termed Down-and-Back (DnB) neurons, that are activated by noxious heat, promote nociceptive behavior, and are required for robust escape responses to noxious stimuli. Electron microscopic circuit reconstruction shows that DnBs are targets of nociceptive and mechanosensory neurons, are directly presynaptic to pre-motor circuits, and link indirectly to Goro rolling command-like neurons. DnB activation promotes activity in Goro neurons, and coincident inactivation of Goro neurons prevents the rolling sequence but leaves intact body bending motor responses. Thus, activity from nociceptors to DnB interneurons coordinates modular elements of nociceptive escape behavior.",2018,"Anita Burgos, Ken Honjo, Tomoko Ohyama, Cheng Sam Qian, Grace Ji-Eun Shin, Daryl M Gohl, Marion Silies, W Daniel Tracey, Marta Zlatic, Albert Cardona, Wesley B Grueber, Anita Burgos, Ken Honjo, Tomoko Ohyama, Cheng Sam Qian, Grace Ji-Eun Shin, Daryl M Gohl, Marion Silies, W Daniel Tracey, Marta Zlatic, Albert Cardona, Wesley B Grueber"
Characterization of a novel Drosophila melanogaster cis-regulatory module that drives gene expression to the larval tracheal system and adult thoracic musculature,30096221,10.1002/dvg.23222,"In a previous bioinformatics analysis we identified 10 conserved Drosophila melanogaster sequences that reside upstream from protein coding genes (CGs).

Analysis of 646 bp-lacZ lines revealed that TT-CRM drives gene expression not only to the larval, prepupal, and pupal tracheal system but also to the adult dorsal longitudinal muscles. The patterns of mRNA expression of the transgene and of the CGs that lie in the vicinity of TT-CRM were investigated both in dissected trachea and in adult thoraces. Through RT-qPCR we observed that in the tracheal system the pattern of expression of 646 bp-lacZ is similar to the pattern of expression of CG32239 and CG13711, whereas in the thoracic muscles 646 bp-lacZ expression accompanies the expression of CG12493.

Synaptic Spinules in the Olfactory Circuit of Drosophila melanogaster,29636666,10.3389/fncel.2018.00086,"Here we report on ultrastructural features of brain synapses in the fly Drosophila melanogaster and outline a perspective for the study of their functional significance. Images taken with the aid of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (EM) at 20 nm intervals across olfactory glomerulus DA2 revealed that some synaptic boutons are penetrated by protrusions emanating from other neurons. Similar structures in the brain of mammals are known as synaptic spinules. A survey with transmission EM (TEM) disclosed that these structures are frequent throughout the antennal lobe. Detailed neuronal tracings revealed that spinules are formed by all three major types of neurons innervating glomerulus DA2 but the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) receive significantly more spinules than other olfactory neurons. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that appear to represent material that has pinched-off from spinules are also most abundant in presynaptic boutons of OSNs. Inside the host neuron, a close association was observed between spinules, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. We propose that by releasing material into the host neuron, through a process triggered by synaptic activity and analogous to axonal pruning, synaptic spinules could function as a mechanism for synapse tagging, synaptic remodeling and neural plasticity.

Concomitant changes in radiation resistance and trehalose levels during life stages of Drosophila melanogaster suggest radio-protective function of trehalose,29613812,10.1080/09553002.2018.1460499,"Purpose:
      
    

    
      During development, various life stages of Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) show different levels of resistance to gamma irradiation, with the early pupal stage being the most radiation sensitive. This provides us an opportunity to explore the biochemical basis of such variations. The present study was carried out to understand the mechanisms underlying radiation resistance during life stages of D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Homogenates from all the life stages of D. melanogaster were prepared at stipulated age. These homogenates were used for the determination of (1) enzymatic antioxidants: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, D. melanogaster glutathione peroxidase (DmGPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST); (2) reducing non-enzymatic antioxidants: total antioxidant capacity (TAC), reduced glutathione (GSH) and non-reducing non-enzymatic antioxidant trehalose; and (3) levels of protein carbonyl (PC) content. Age-dependent changes in radiation resistance and associated biochemical changes were also studied in young (2 d) and old (20 and 30 d) flies.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      TAC and GSH were found high in the early pupal stage, whereas catalase and DmGPx were found to increase in the early pupal stage. The non-feeding third instar (NFTI) larvae were found to have high levels of SOD and GST, besides NFTI larvae showed high levels of trehalose. A remarkable decrease was observed in radiation resistance and trehalose levels during the early pupal stage. The PC level was the highest during early pupal stage and was the lowest in NFTI larvae. Older flies showed high level of PC compared with young flies.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In vitro increments in trehalose concentration correspond to reduced formation of PCs, suggesting a protective role of trehalose against free radicals. A strong correlation between levels of trehalose and PC formation suggests amelioration of proteome damage due to ionizing radiation (IR). Stages with high trehalose levels showed protected proteome and high radiation resistance, suggesting a significant role for this disaccharide in radiation resistance.",2018,"Jagdish Gopal Paithankar, Shamprasad Varija Raghu, Rajashekhar K Patil"

Alt-EJ has been observed to be upregulated in HR-deficient tumors and is essential for the survival and proliferation of these cells. Alt-EJ shares many initial processing steps with homologous recombination, specifically end resection; therefore, studying alt-EJ repair junctions can provide useful insight into aborted HR repair.

Flying Drosophilamelanogaster maintain arbitrary but stable headings relative to the angle of polarized light,29593084,10.1242/jeb.177550,"Animals must use external cues to maintain a straight course over long distances. In this study, we investigated how the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster selects and maintains a flight heading relative to the axis of linearly polarized light, a visual cue produced by the atmospheric scattering of sunlight. To track flies' headings over extended periods, we used a flight simulator that coupled the angular velocity of dorsally presented polarized light to the stroke amplitude difference of the animals' wings. In the simulator, most flies actively maintained a stable heading relative to the axis of polarized light for the duration of 15 min flights. We found that individuals selected arbitrary, unpredictable headings relative to the polarization axis, which demonstrates that D. melanogaster can perform proportional navigation using a polarized light pattern. When flies flew in two consecutive bouts separated by a 5 min gap, the two flight headings were correlated, suggesting individuals retain a memory of their chosen heading. We found that adding a polarized light pattern to a light intensity gradient enhanced flies' orientation ability, suggesting D. melanogaster use a combination of cues to navigate. For both polarized light and intensity cues, flies' capacity to maintain a stable heading gradually increased over several minutes from the onset of flight. Our findings are consistent with a model in which each individual initially orients haphazardly but then settles on a heading which is maintained via a self-reinforcing process. This may be a general dispersal strategy for animals with no target destination.",2018,"Timothy L Warren, Peter T Weir, Michael H Dickinson, Timothy L Warren, Peter T Weir, Michael H Dickinson"

Here, we apply machine learning and show that individual D. melanogaster are visually distinct. We also use the striking similarity of Drosophila's visual system to current convolutional neural networks to theoretically investigate D. melanogaster's capacity for visual understanding. We find that, despite their limited optical resolution, D. melanogaster's neuronal architecture has the capability to extract and encode a rich feature set that allows flies to re-identify individual conspecifics with surprising accuracy. These experiments provide a proof of principle that Drosophila inhabit a much more complex visual world than previously appreciated.",2018,"Jonathan Schneider, Nihal Murali, Graham W Taylor, Joel D Levine"
Big Lessons from Tiny Flies: Drosophila melanogaster as a Model to Explore Dysfunction of Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Neurotransmitter Systems,29914172,10.3390/ijms19061788,"The brain of Drosophila melanogaster is comprised of some 100,000 neurons, 127 and 80 of which are dopaminergic and serotonergic, respectively. Their activity regulates behavioral functions equivalent to those in mammals, e.g., motor activity, reward and aversion, memory formation, feeding, sexual appetite, etc. Mammalian dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are known to be heterogeneous. They differ in their projections and in their gene expression profile. A sophisticated genetic tool box is available, which allows for targeting virtually any gene with amazing precision in Drosophila melanogaster. Similarly, Drosophila genes can be replaced by their human orthologs including disease-associated alleles. Finally, genetic manipulation can be restricted to single fly neurons. This has allowed for addressing the role of individual neurons in circuits, which determine attraction and aversion, sleep and arousal, odor preference, etc. Flies harboring mutated human orthologs provide models which can be interrogated to understand the effect of the mutant protein on cell fate and neuronal connectivity. These models are also useful for proof-of-concept studies to examine the corrective action of therapeutic strategies. Finally, experiments in Drosophila can be readily scaled up to an extent, which allows for drug screening with reasonably high throughput.",2018,"Ameya Sanjay Kasture, Thomas Hummel, Sonja Sucic, Michael Freissmuth, Ameya Sanjay Kasture, Thomas Hummel, Sonja Sucic, Michael Freissmuth"
Low concentrations of monosodium glutamate (MSG) are safe in male Drosophila melanogaster,30223880,10.1186/s13104-018-3775-x,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been marred by a lot of controversy on its safety. In a majority of experimental studies, administration of the compound has been parenteral, and yet little is known about MSG safety consumed as a food supplement. In this study, we assessed the effects of low concentrations of MSG on the activity of hydrogen scavenging, catalase activity and climbing as well as lifespan in male Drosophila melanogaster over a 30 days period since this has been sparsely studied.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      No significant differences were associated with MSG at 5%, 1%, 0.2%, 0.04% on hydrogen peroxide scavenging, negative geotaxis and lifespan in W1118 male D. melanogaster. Significant differences were found in 5% MSG on catalase activity, showing that high MSG concentrations would affect tissue health in male D. melanogaster.

Evidence that the radioprotector effect of ascorbic acid depends on the radiation dose rate,30081379,10.1016/j.etap.2018.07.015,"Many studies have revealed that ascorbic acid (Aa) acts as a powerful inhibitor of genetic damage.

After pretreatment, larvae were irradiated with 20 Gy of gamma rays administered at 36 or 960 Gy/h. Toxicity, development rate and frequency of mutant spots were recorded.

Regulators of Long-Term Memory Revealed by Mushroom Body-Specific Gene Expression Profiling in Drosophila melanogaster,29925565,10.1534/genetics.118.301106,"Memory formation is achieved by genetically tightly controlled molecular pathways that result in a change of synaptic strength and synapse organization. While for short-term memory traces, rapidly acting biochemical pathways are in place, the formation of long-lasting memories requires changes in the transcriptional program of a cell. Although many genes involved in learning and memory formation have been identified, little is known about the genetic mechanisms required for changing the transcriptional program during different phases of long-term memory (LTM) formation. With Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, we profiled transcriptomic changes in the mushroom body-a memory center in the fly brain-at distinct time intervals during appetitive olfactory LTM formation using the targeted DamID technique. We describe the gene expression profiles during these phases and tested 33 selected candidate genes for deficits in LTM formation using RNAi knockdown. We identified 10 genes that enhance or decrease memory when knocked-down in the mushroom body. For vajk-1 and hacd1-the two strongest hits-we gained further support for their crucial role in appetitive learning and forgetting. These findings show that profiling gene expression changes in specific cell-types harboring memory traces provides a powerful entry point to identify new genes involved in learning and memory. The presented transcriptomic data may further be used as resource to study genes acting at different memory phases.",2018,"Yves F Widmer, Adem Bilican, RÃ©my Bruggmann, Simon G Sprecher, Yves F Widmer, Adem Bilican, RÃ©my Bruggmann, Simon G Sprecher"

[Properties of inbred Drosophila melanogaster lines obtained from a population selected for an increased rate of embryonic development],9026462,,"Two heterogeneous Drosophila melanogaster populations were subjected to selection for an increased rate of embryonic development by picking out the first 10% of hatching larvae. After repeating this procedure in 15 generations, ""fast"" populations were obtained, in which the duration of embryonic development at high temperature (31-32 degrees C) was 30-40 min less than in nonselected control populations. The results of preliminary experiments on substituting the second and third chromosomes in the selected and control populations provide evidence that selected genes responsible for accelerated development are located on the second chromosome. Inbreeding in 12 generations of selected populations was used to obtain about 40 lines homozygous, in particular, at the alcohol dehydrogenase gene. In four lines, the developmental rate was higher than in a homozygous control line, but others did not differ from control or developed more slowly. The duration of embryonic development at 32 degrees C in fast lines was 50-70 min shorter than in control, but this difference was significantly less at lower temperatures (25 and 17 degrees C). Hence, high temperature is primarily a factor in providing conditions for the expression of genes determining the developmental rate, rather than a factor of selection for these genes. It is suggested that selected genes modify developmental rate dependence on temperature.",1996,"A A NeÄ­fakh, A A Minin, S G Ozerova, N A Abramova, A A NeÄ­fakh, A A Minin, S G Ozerova, N A Abramova"

The casein kinase 1 alpha gene of Drosophila melanogaster is developmentally regulated and the kinase activity of the protein induced by DNA damage,8832407,,"We report the molecular cloning and characterisation of the first CK1(casein kinase) gene of Drosophila melanogaster (dmCK1). The protein sequence (DMCK1) shares significant homology with other mammalian CK1 protein kinases of the alpha sub-class. The dmCK1 gene is expressed only in adult females and during early embryonic development as a single transcript. Western blot analysis of total protein extracts of different stages of development show that the gene product is likewise present during early embryogenesis and in adult females. Kinase activity studies show that DMCK1 is active when in vitro translated but inactive when immunoprecipitated from total early embryo extracts. However, after dephosphorylation treatment the immunoprecipitates show high kinase activity. More significantly, DMCK1 kinase activity present in the immunoprecipitates can be specifically activated by gamma-irradiation of early embryos. Also, when DMCK1 is immunoprecipitated after irradiation it appears to undergo phosphorylation. Immunolocalization of DMCK1 in early embryos shows that the protein is predominantly cytoplasmic but after irradiation there is a significant relocalization to the interphase nucleus. The results suggest a possible requirement of the Drosophila CK1 alpha for mechanisms associated with DNA repair during early embryogenesis.",1996,"J A Santos, E Logarinho, C Tapia, C C Allende, J E Allende, C E Sunkel, J A Santos, E Logarinho, C Tapia, C C Allende, J E Allende, C E Sunkel"
Dosage compensation regulatory proteins and the evolution of sex chromosomes in Drosophila,8889531,,"In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, the four male specific lethal (msl) genes are required to achieve dosage compensation of the male X chromosome. The MSL proteins are thought to interact with cis-acting sites that confer dosage compensation to nearby genes, as they are detected at hundreds of discrete sites along the length of the polytene X chromosome in males but not in females. The histone H4 acetylated isoform, H4Ac16, colocalizes with the MSL proteins at a majority of sites on the D. melanogaster X chromosome. Using polytene chromosome immunostaining of other species from the genus Drosophila, we found that X chromosome association of MSL proteins and H4Ac16 is conserved despite differences in the sex chromosome karyotype between species. Our results support a model in which cis-acting regulatory sites for dosage compensation evolve on a neo-X chromosome arm in response to the degeneration of its former homologue.",1996,"J R Bone, M I Kuroda, J R Bone, M I Kuroda"
Expression of a cystine-rich fish antifreeze in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,8589739,10.1007/BF01979921,We have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the transgenic expression of cystine-rich Type II antifreeze protein (AFP) from sea raven. This protein was synthesized and secreted into fly haemolymph where it migrated as a larger species (16 kDa) than the mature form of the protein (14 kDa) as judged by immunoblotting. Drosophila-produced Type II AFP demonstrated antifreeze activity both in terms of thermal hysteresis (0.13 degree C) and inhibition of ice recrystallization. Recombinant AFP was purified and N-terminal sequencing revealed a 17 aa extension that began at the predicted signal peptide cleavage point. The expression of all three AFP types in transgenic Drosophila has now been achieved. We conclude that the globular Type II and Type III AFPs are better choices for antifreeze transfer to other organisms than is the more widely used linear Type I AFP.,1996,"B P Duncker, J A Hermans, P L Davies, V K Walker, B P Duncker, J A Hermans, P L Davies, V K Walker"

A serine-kinase associated with the p127-l(2)gl tumour suppressor of Drosophila may regulate the binding of p127 to nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain and the attachment of p127 to the plasma membrane,8799824,,"The p127 tumour suppressor protein encoded by the lethal(2)giant larvae, [l(2)gl], gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a component of a cytoskeletal network distributed in both the cytoplasm and on the inner face of the plasma membrane. The p127 protein forms high molecular mass complexes consisting mainly of homo-oligomerized p127 molecules and at least ten additional proteins. One of these proteins has been recently identified as nonmuscle myosin type II heavy chain. To determine the functional interactions between p127 and other proteins present in the p127 complexes, we analyzed p127 for posttranslational modifications and found that p127 can be phosphorylated at serine residues. In this report we describe the characteristics of a serine kinase which is associated with p127, as judged by its recovery in p127 complexes purified by either gel filtration or immuno-affinity chromatography. This kinase phosphorylates p127 in vitro and its activation by supplementing ATP results in the release of p127 from the plasma membrane. Moreover, similar activation of the kinase present in immuno-purified p127 complexes dissociates nonmuscle myosin II from p127 without affecting the homo-oligomerization of p127. This dissociation can be inhibited by staurosporine and a 26mer peptide covering amino acid positions 651 to 676 of p127 and containing five serine residues which are evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to humans. These results indicate that a serine-kinase tightly associated with p127 regulates p127 binding with components of the cytoskeleton present in both the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane.",1996,"A Kalmes, G Merdes, B Neumann, D Strand, B M Mechler, A Kalmes, G Merdes, B Neumann, D Strand, B M Mechler"

Ten isofemale lines of each population and species were grown at different constant temperatures spanning their complete thermal range from 12 to 31Â°C. Genetic variability between isofemale lines was not affected by growth temperature, but was consistently less in D. simulans. For all traits, the dark pigmentation of the abdominal segments decreased according to growth temperature, in agreement with the thermal budget adaptive hypothesis. The shapes of the response curves were different between the abdominal segments, but for a given segment, quite similar in the two species. On average D. simulans was lighter than D. melanogaster, but the difference was mainly expressed at higher temperatures. An interesting result was the difference observed between the two localities: flies from the colder locality (Villeurbanne) were found to be darker than flies from the warmer locality (Bordeaux). Interestingly, this difference was expressed only at low temperatures, 21Â°C and below, that is, at temperatures encountered in natural conditions. This suggests an adaptive response resulting in a change of the shape of reaction norm and involving genotype-environment interactions.

Differential stability of Drosophila embryonic mRNAs during subsequent larval development,3932366,10.1083/jcb.101.5.1808,"The relative stabilities of specific embryonic mRNAs that persist in Drosophila melanogaster larvae were determined using an approach that combined RNA density labeling with cell-free translation.

Using this approach, we have determined that different embryonic mRNA species persist for varying periods during subsequent development, with half-lives ranging from approximately 2 to approximately 30 h. The embryonic histone mRNAs are relatively unstable; they are no longer detectable by 9 h of larval development. By 41 h of larval development, 90% of the nonhistone mRNAs assayed have decayed considerably; computerized scanning densitometry of translation products indicates that these transcripts are not decaying as members of discrete half-life classes. The persisting mRNAs that remain are very long-lived; their in vitro translation products can still be detected after 91 h of larval development. We have tentatively identified the mRNAs that encode actin, tropomyosin, and tubulin as members of this stable mRNA population. Although embryonic mRNAs do fall into these three broad classes of stability, they appear to decay with a continuum of half-lives. Because the range of half-lives is so great, mRNA stability is probably an important factor controlling mRNA abundance during Drosophila development.",1985,"J A Winkles, R M Grainger, J A Winkles, R M Grainger"
"Xanthurenic acid 8-O-beta-D-glucoside, a novel tryptophan metabolite in eye-color mutants of Drosophila melanogaster",3922986,,"An unknown fluorescent metabolite has been isolated from heads of eye-color mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. Only a few mutations cause it to accumulate, viz. cardinal (cd), dark red brown (drb), Henna-recessive (Hnr), purple (pr), Punch2 (Pu2), Punch-Grape (PuGr), and scarlet (st). After purification by ion-exchange chromatography, the spectroscopic, chemical, and enzymatic analyses revealed that it is a novel quinoline derivative: xanthurenic acid 8-O-beta-D-glucoside. Feeding experiments suggest that this glucoside is synthesized from 3-hydroxykynurenine and that free xanthurenic acid is not a precursor. The results from the analysis for its occurrence in double mutants, together with the fact that xanthurenic acid 8-glucoside share the same precursor as xanthurenic acid and xanthommatin, suggest that xanthurenic acid 8-glucoside formation is closely related to the regulation of the last step in the biosynthesis of xanthommatin.",1985,"J FerrÃ©, M D Real, J L MÃ©nsua, K B Jacobson, J FerrÃ©, M D Real, J L MÃ©nsua, K B Jacobson"

Cyclic AMP-induced phosphorylation of 27.5-kDa protein(s) in larval brains of normal and memory-mutant Drosophila melanogaster,2831325,,"Whole brains dissected from third-instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster increase their cAMP content when incubated with octopamine, dopamine and serotonin, especially in the presence of theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The most pronounced rise in cAMP was produced by forskolin. When brains prelabelled with [32P]orthophosphate were subjected to these treatments, the increased labelling of 27.5-kDa protein(s) of pI 6.3-6.6 (substrate A) was observed in all cases, as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Labelling of substrate A was enhanced without any drug addition in brains of the dunceM11 mutant strain, which has abnormally high basal cAMP levels. The labelling of substrate A was also promoted by the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine. The data suggest that in Drosophila larval brain the 27.5-kDa protein is a target of cAMP-triggered phosphorylation and may be related to potassium channel(s).",1987,"P DÃ©vay, P Friedrich, P DÃ©vay, P Friedrich"

(Insecta, Diptera)",3107977,10.1016/s0013-9351(87)80063-4,"To improve our knowledge of pyrethroid toxicity mechanisms, Drosophila melanogaster was chosen as a model species, with well-defined characteristics. This study reports the results of the toxic effects of cypermethrin and fenvalerate on larvae and adults of four D. melanogaster strains. Our results show that cypermethrin is more toxic than fenvalerate at larval and adult stages, that growth on media containing insecticide significantly decreases the rate of preimaginal development, and that adult males are more sensitive than are females to both insecticides.",1987,"M Batiste-Alentorn, N Xamena, A VelÃ¡zquez, A Creus, R Marcos"
