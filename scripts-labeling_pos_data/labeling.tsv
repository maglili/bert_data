the drosophila eye, a paradigm for epithelial organization, is highly polarized with mirror-image symmetry about the equator. the r3 and r4 photoreceptors in each ommatidium are vital in this polarity; they adopt asymmetrical positions in adult ommatidia and are the site of action for several essential genes. two such genes are frizzled (fz) and dishevelled (dsh), the products of which are components of a signalling pathway required in r3, and which are thought to be activated by a diffusible signal. here we show that the transmembrane receptor notch is required downstream of dsh in r3/r4 for them to adopt distinct fates. by using an enhancer for the notch target gene enhancer of split mdelta, we show that notch becomes activated specifically in r4. we propose that fz/dsh promotes activity of the notch ligand delta and inhibits notch receptor activity in r3, creating a difference in notch signalling capacity between r3 and r4. subsequent feedback in the notch pathway ensures that this difference becomes amplified. this interplay between fz/dsh and notch indicates that polarity is established through local comparisons between two cells and explains how a signal from one position (for example, the equator in the eye) could be interpreted by all ommatidia in the field.

--------------------

mitosis in most drosophila cells is triggered by brief bursts of transcription of string (stg), a cdc25-type phosphatase that activates the mitotic kinase, cdk1 (cdc2). to understand how string transcription is regulated, we analyzed the expression of string-lacz reporter genes covering approximately 40 kb of the string locus. we also tested protein coding fragments of the string locus of 6 kb to 31.6 kb for their ability to complement loss of string function in embryos and imaginal discs. a plethora of cis-acting elements spread over >30 kb control string transcription in different cells and tissue types. regulatory elements specific to subsets of epidermal cells, mesoderm, trachea and nurse cells were identified, but the majority of the string locus appears to be devoted to controlling cell proliferation during neurogenesis. consistent with this, compact promotor-proximal sequences are sufficient for string function during imaginal disc growth, but additional distal elements are required for the development of neural structures in the eye, wing, leg and notum. we suggest that, during evolution, cell-type-specific control elements were acquired by a simple growth-regulated promoter as a means of coordinating cell division with developmental processes, particularly neurogenesis.
