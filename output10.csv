The early life of a fly glial cell,26224590,10.1002/wdev.200,"Throughout evolution, glia have key regulatory roles in neural development and function. Typically, they control the response to developmental and/or pathological signals, thereby affecting neural proliferation, remodeling, survival, and regeneration. Such complex biology depends on the plastic features of glial cells, but also on the presence of different classes of glial cells, hence the importance of understanding the cellular and the molecular mechanisms underlying their development.

Cyclic AMP Mimics the Anti-ageing Effects of Calorie Restriction by Up-Regulating Sirtuin,26153625,10.1038/srep12012,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays an important role in many biological processes as a second messenger, and cAMP treatment has been reported to extend the lifespan of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. Our study showed that exogenous cAMP improved ageing-related phenotypes by increasing the protein level of Sirtuins, which prevented metabolic disorders to mimic the effect of calorie restriction. Experiments in vitro showed that cAMP directly bound to SIRT1 and SIRT3 and consequently increased their activity. These findings suggest that cAMP slows the ageing process and is a good candidate to mimic calorie restriction.

Insect endosymbiont proliferation is limited by lipid availability,25027439,10.7554/eLife.02964,"Spiroplasma poulsonii is a maternally transmitted bacterial endosymbiont that is naturally associated with Drosophila melanogaster. S. poulsonii resides extracellularly in the hemolymph, where it must acquire metabolites to sustain proliferation. In this study, we find that Spiroplasma proliferation specifically depletes host hemolymph diacylglyceride, the major lipid class transported by the lipoprotein, Lpp. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lpp expression, which reduces the amount of circulating lipids, inhibits Spiroplasma proliferation demonstrating that bacterial proliferation requires hemolymph-lipids. Altogether, our study shows that an insect endosymbiont acquires specific lipidic metabolites from the transport lipoproteins in the hemolymph of its host. In addition, we show that the proliferation of this endosymbiont is limited by the availability of hemolymph lipids. This feature could limit endosymbiont over-proliferation under conditions of host nutrient limitation as lipid availability is strongly influenced by the nutritional state.",2014,"Jeremy K Herren, Juan C Paredes, Fanny Schüpfer, Karim Arafah, Philippe Bulet, Bruno Lemaitre, Jeremy K Herren, Juan C Paredes, Fanny Schüpfer, Karim Arafah, Philippe Bulet, Bruno Lemaitre"

Mitochondrial polymorphism had few effects on nuclear gene expression in females but major effects in males, modifying nearly 10% of transcripts.

These data allow us to test conflicting predictions about the factors affecting the softness of selection. First, we show that the softness of selection is not determined by ecological conditions alone. Second, we find that resource limitation makes selection stronger but does not make it softer. Third, we find that wild-type individuals tend to benefit more than mutants from being reared with competitors of low genetic quality.

Here we present genetic evidence that R2D2 and Dcr-2 are both required for loading siRNA onto the siRISC complex. Consistent with this, only the Dcr-2/R2D2 complex, but neither Dcr-2 nor R2D2 alone, can efficiently interact with duplex siRNA. Furthermore, both dsRNA-binding domains of R2D2 are critical for binding to siRNA and promoting assembly of the siRISC complexes.",2006,"Xiang Liu, Feng Jiang, Savitha Kalidas, Dean Smith, Qinghua Liu, Xiang Liu, Feng Jiang, Savitha Kalidas, Dean Smith, Qinghua Liu"
A study of canalization and developmental stability in the sternopleural bristle system of Drosophila melanogaster,16153035,,"Among the explanations for minimizing the effects of extraneous variation has been canalization and developmental stability. However, there is little agreement as to whether these two processes reflect a common set of mechanisms. This confusion is inflated due to the lack of consensus as to a precise definition of canalization. In this study, canalization in the sternopleural bristle system is used to investigate the relationships between measures of canalization and developmental stability by comparing how a panel of naturally derived lines responds to both genetic and environmental perturbations. No evidence for a common mechanism between the different measures of canalization was observed. Furthermore, a hypothesis regarding a common mechanism for environmental and genetic canalization was tested, and no evidence was found to support it. However, there is evidence for a relationship between at least one form of canalization and developmental stability.",2005,"Ian Dworkin, Ian Dworkin"
Regulation of the expression of histone H3.3 by differential polyadenylation,16121246,10.1139/g05-009,"Previously we have shown that the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the replacement histone genes H3.3.A and H3.3B of Drosophila melanogaster differ in their nucleotide sequences and have different polyadenylation sites. To understand their functional relevance, which might explain the presence and evolutionary conservation of 2 different H3.3 genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs with different 3' UTR sections were studied by the expression of GFP as a marker protein.

Stress and adaptation in conservation genetics,16033545,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00885.x,"Stress, adaptation and evolution are major concerns in conservation biology. Stresses from pollution, climatic changes, disease etc. may affect population persistence. Further, stress typically occurs when species are placed in captivity. Threatened species are usually managed to conserve their ability to adapt to environmental changes, whilst species in captivity undergo adaptations that are deleterious upon reintroduction into the wild. In model studies using Drosophila melanogaster, we have found that; (a) inbreeding and loss of genetic variation reduced resistance to the stress of disease, (b) extinction rates under inbreeding are elevated by stress, (c) adaptive evolutionary potential in an increasingly stressful environment is reduced in small population, (d) rates of inbreeding are elevated under stressful conditions, (e) genetic adaptation to captivity reduces fitness when populations are reintroduced into the 'wild', and (f) the deleterious effects of adaptation on reintroduction success can be reduced by population fragmentation.",2005,"R Frankham, R Frankham"
Maximum-likelihood methods for detecting recent positive selection and localizing the selected site in the genome,15972464,10.1534/genetics.105.041368,"Two maximum-likelihood methods are proposed for detecting recent, strongly positive selection and for localizing the target of selection along a recombining chromosome. The methods utilize the compact mutation frequency spectrum at multiple neutral loci that are partially linked to the selected site. Using simulated data, we show that the power of the tests lies between 80 and 98% in most cases, and the false positive rate could be as low as approximately 10% when the number of sampled marker loci is sufficiently large (> or = 20). The confidence interval around the estimated position of selection is reasonably narrow. The methods are applied to X chromosome data of Drosophila melanogaster from a European and an African population.

In the present study, we applied DNAzyme targeting mPer1 to interfere the expression of mPer1 in CNS in mice and studied the role of mPer1 on morphine dependence. We found that the DNAzyme could attenuate the expression of mPer1 in CNS in mice. Mice treated with DNAzyme and morphine synchronously did not show preference to the morphine-trained side, whereas the control group did. In contrast, mice treated with DNAzyme after morphine showed preference to the morphine-trained side as well as the control group did.

This reflex decreases in frequency with repetition, presumably habituation, a nonassociative learning. If each sucrose stimulation is followed by a bitter stimulation, quinine chloride, the PER declines more rapidly, probably the result of conditioning, an associative learning. The present work shows that quinine chloride does not always inhibit PER suppressions but depends on the moment of delivery, being most effective when presented immediately after a sucrose stimulation. A bitter stimulus presented before, or simultaneously with a sucrose stimulation is less effective than habituation to sucrose alone. This experiment provides evidence for an interpretation in terms of cognitive association. The model of learning is not a Pavlovian conditioning as advanced by Medioni and Vaysse (1975), but corresponds to the punishment paradigm of Dyal and Corning (1973).",1995,"A Bouhouche, A Elkhessaimi, G Vaysse, M K Choulli, A Bouhouche, A Elkhessaimi, G Vaysse, M K Choulli"

Its involvement with these seemingly diverse phenomena suggests that the normal zeste product functions in the decondensation of chromatin. A model is presented proposing that zeste is important for opening and stabilizing domains of chromatin, a step in gene determination and the establishment of cell memory. It postulates that chromatin domains that have been structurally modified by chromosomal rearrangement or by insertion of transposable elements are particularly sensitive to the absence or modification of the zeste protein.

Thus, the longevity genes involved also appear to have control over the rate of development.

These repeats along with the MDG1 copies inserted in them are under-replicated in polytene chromosomes. Such repeats may also be located in the intercalary heterochromatin site 12E of the X chromosome. Chromosomal heterochromatic regions are enriched with one of the two main genomic variants of MDG1, MDG1het, identifiable by EcoRI restriction. From Southern DNA blot analysis the number of MDG1het copies and their sites within the heterochromatin are invariant in all the stocks examined, while there is not a single MDG1 site along the polytene chromosomes shared by all the stocks in question.",1989,"Shevelyov YuYa, M D Balakireva, V A Gvozdev, Shevelyov YuYa, M D Balakireva, V A Gvozdev"
A mutation that changes cell movement and cell fate in the zebrafish embryo,2911386,10.1038/337358a0,"The study of developmental patterning has been facilitated by the availability of mutations that produce changes in cell fate, in animals such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. We now describe a zygotic lethal mutation in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio, that also changes how particular embryonic cells develop. Severe pattern deficiencies are observed that are restricted to a single body region, the trunk. The mutation may directly affect mesoderm, as somites do not form in the trunk. Head and tail structures, including tail somites, are relatively undisturbed. The earliest detected expression of the mutation is during gastrulation, when movements of mesodermal cells occur incorrectly. We injected prospective trunk mesodermal cells with lineage tracer dye and observed that in mutants these cells may enter a new body region, the tail, and there may express a new fate appropriate for the changed position.",1989,"C B Kimmel, D A Kane, C Walker, R M Warga, M B Rothman, C B Kimmel, D A Kane, C Walker, R M Warga, M B Rothman"

Spontaneous formation of compound X chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster,3135238,,"Males carrying different X chromosomes were tested for the ability to produce daughters with attached-X chromosomes. This ability is characteristic of males carrying an X chromosome derived from 59b-z, a multiply marked X chromosome, and is especially pronounced in males carrying the unstable 59b-z chromosomes Uc and Uc-lr. Recombination experiments with one of the Uc-lr chromosomes showed that the formation of compound chromosomes depends on two widely separated segments. One of these is proximal to the forked locus and is probably proximal to the carnation locus. This segment may contain the actual site of chromosome attachment. The other essential segment lies between the crossveinless and vermilion loci and may contain multiple factors that influence the attachment process.",1988,"R J Morrison, J D Raymond, J R Zunt, J K Lim, M J Simmons, R J Morrison, J D Raymond, J R Zunt, J K Lim, M J Simmons"

In addition, hydrogen peroxide which acts as a substrate for the enzyme in vitro enabling the formation of covalent bonding between the egg-shell proteins, was found to be produced at the follicle cell plasma membrane during the last stage of oogenesis. It is concluded that hydrogen peroxide is an endogenous, programmed product of the follicle cells, responsible for the action of peroxidase in order to oxidize the tyrosyl residues producing di-tyrosine and tri-tyrosine bonds between the chorion polypeptides.",1985,"L H Margaritis, L H Margaritis"
Maternal-Zygotic Lethal Interactions in DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER : Zeste-White Region Single-Cistron Mutations,17246119,,Thirty-eight mutations in 13 essential loci in the zeste-white region were tested for interacting maternal and zygotic gene activity. Maternal mutant heterozygosity provided a partial maternal defect and position-effect variegation was used to alter the level of zygotic gene activity. This method yields a minimum estimate of the number of genes for which zygotic development depends upon both gene products stored in the egg and gene products synthesized in the zygote. Lethal interactions were found for one or more alleles at 10 of the 13 loci. The implications of these observations with respect to gene regulation and developmental sequence are considered.,1983,"L G Robbins, L G Robbins"

The decrease paralleled the age-related decrease in overall protein synthesis. In contrast, the termination stage showed little decrease until the organisms were very old. Of the three reactions that comprise peptide chain elongation, the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes decreased greatly with age, and the decrease paralleled that of peptide chain elongation and of overall protein synthesis. The peptidyl transfer reaction decreased moderately, and the translocation reaction exhibited no measurable decrease with age. Thus, decreased binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes appeared to be a major contributor to the age-related decreases in peptide chain elongation and overall protein synthesis.",1982,"G C Webster, S L Webster, G C Webster, S L Webster"

Possible sources of bias are discussed. The disagreement between these values and those obtained the direct measurements of DNA (more than 10 times greater) is clear. It is suggested that many of the genes of eukaryotes have been duplicated by unequal exchange during recombination and occur in functionally related groups or in supergenes.

When these deficiencies were lethal, we have defined the phenoeffective phase of lethality and studied their phenotype in genetic mosaics (gynandromorphs and mitotic recombination clones). The achaete-scute system affects two functions, one necessary for the differentiation of the embryonic (central?) nervous system and the other necessary for the differentiation of peripheral nervous elements of the chaetes and sensillae of the adult cuticle.

Association of cyclic GMP with gene expression of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,206901,10.1073/pnas.75.3.1480,"The distribution of cyclic nucleotides on polytene chromosomes isolated from Drosophilia melanogaster salivary glands was examined by using an indirect immunofluorescent technique.

The subchromosomal distribution of cyclic GMP correlated with genetically active sites on the chromosomes. After heat-shock treatments, the intensity of cyclic GMP fluorescence was markedly enhanced at specific loci on the chromosomes, with locus 93D as the most intensely fluorescent. Autoradiographic analysis with [3H]uridine revealed that 93D was the most transcriptionally active locus within a particular nucleus. These observations suggest that cyclic GMP may participate in processes associated with transcription on polytene chromosomes.

It has no effect on either the external morphology or longevity of adult hemizygotes or homozygotes. Heterozygotes and hemizygotes are fertile, but homozygotes are sterile. Egg chamber development proceeds through stages 8, and thereafter chambers degenerate. Dying follicle cells are seen in chambers at all positions in the ovarioles. Profollicle cells also die within germaria, and clusters of sister cystocytes take longer than normal to receive their coverings of follicle cells. Egg chambers in the vitellarium contain only about 60% the normal number of follicle cells, these generally have greater lateral dimensions, and their nuclei and nucleoli are also larger than normal. The follicular envelope of mutant chambers often contains gaps through which cystocytes send cytoplasmic projections. Abnormalities seen in development of the fs(1)42 oocyte are likely to be due to its envelope of defective follicle cells.",1977,"W B Rizzo, R C King, W B Rizzo, R C King"
Cell death in ovarian chambers of Drosophila melanogaster,820828,,"An ultrastructural analysis has been made of certain ovarian chambers undergoing abnormal development. The earliest morphological change in these chambers consists of the alteration of the nuclear material which is then followed by engulfment of portions of the nurse cell cytoplasm, including the nuclear fragments, into the overlying follicle cells. The continuation of this process leads to the progressive disappearance of nurse cells with the concomitant formation of huge dense vacuoles in the follicle layer. The morphological features described in the present investigation are similar to those found in other tissues and interpreted as leading to cell death. It is suggested that certain ovarian chambers undergo cell death as a result of the incapability of furthering their development. The role played by cell death in oogenesis is also discussed on the basis of the current literature.",1976,"F Giorgi, P Deri, F Giorgi, P Deri"
Stability of a position-effect variegation in normal and transdetermined larval blastemas from Drosophila melanogaster,5267143,10.1073/pnas.65.3.633,"Male genital disks of a yellow-variegated genotype were implanted into the abdomens of adult females to test the stability of variegated clones in the blastemas formed by the implants. Upon reimplantation into metamorphosing larval hosts, test fragments of the proliferating blastemas differentiated into variegated organs, with yellow and wild-type areas. In later transfer generations clones were separated, which appeared stable for either wild type or yellow; variegation was no longer occurring. In all the lines differentiation occurred also into other organs (allotypic) than those characteristically formed by the genital disc (transdetermination). The absence of new variegation in these transdetermined organs is discussed as evidence against a reversal to the embryonic state in the cells of the transdetermining blastema. The variegation process seems not to be affected by, nor does it in this case influence, the process of transdetermination.",1970,"E Hadorn, R Gsell, J Schultz, E Hadorn, R Gsell, J Schultz"

Having studied both parametric and nonparametric signal extraction techniques, we identified the lack of specific criteria enabling users to select the optimal signal extraction parameters. Exploiting the expression profile of bicoid gene, which is a maternal segmentation coordinate gene found in Drosophila melanogaster, we introduce a new approach for optimising the signal extraction using a nonparametric technique.

SMURC: High-Dimension Small-Sample Multivariate Regression With Covariance Estimation,26761909,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2515993,We consider a high-dimension low sample-size multivariate regression problem that accounts for correlation of the response variables. The system is underdetermined as there are more parameters than samples. We show that the maximum likelihood approach with covariance estimation is senseless because the likelihood diverges. We subsequently propose a normalization of the likelihood function that guarantees convergence. We call this method small-sample multivariate regression with covariance (SMURC) estimation. We derive an optimization problem and its convex approximation to compute SMURC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the regularized likelihood estimator with known covariance matrix and the sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model. We also apply SMURC to the inference of the wing-muscle gene network of the Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly).,2017,"Belhassen Bayar, Nidhal Bouaynaya, Roman Shterenberg, Belhassen Bayar, Nidhal Bouaynaya, Roman Shterenberg"

Physical compensation of phase curvature in digital holographic microscopy by use of programmable liquid lens,26192688,10.1364/AO.54.005229,"Quantitative phase measurements obtained with digital holographic microscopes are strongly dependent on the optical arrangement of the imaging system. The nontelecentric operation provides phase measurements affected by a parabolic phase factor and requires numerical postprocessing, which does not always remove all the perturbation. Accurate phase measurements are achieved by using the imaging system in telecentric mode. Unfortunately, this condition is not accomplished when a commercial microscope is used as the imaging system. In this paper, we present an approach for obtaining accurate phase measurements in nontelecentric imaging systems without the need for numerical postprocessing. The method uses an electrically tunable liquid lens to illuminate the sample so that the perturbing parabolic wavefront is cancelled out.

We show that down and up-regulation of dube3a are both detrimental to learning in larvae and adults. Using conditional gene expression we found that dube3a is required for normal brain development and during adulthood. Furthermore, we suggest that dube3a could be interacting with other learning and memory genes such as derailed.

The results show that R0, r and Tg present differential responses to thermal variation. Although temperature effects on R0 and Tg are non-linear, r response was negligible. R0 and Tg comprise a generational time scale, while r is at a chronological time scale.

The control can be ineffective or even counterproductive at small intensities, and the interventions can be extremely costly at very large intensities.

Since the discovery of the role of the Scribble polarity module in apico-basal cell polarity, these proteins have also been recognized as having important roles in other forms of polarity, as well as regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell signalling and vesicular trafficking.

The effect of deleterious mutations and age on recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,22276549,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01450.x,"At the population level, recombination mediates the efficiency with which selection can eliminate deleterious mutations. At the individual level, deleterious alleles may influence recombination, which would change the rate at which linkage disequilibrium is eroded and thereby alter the efficiency with which deleterious alleles are purged. Here, we test whether the presence of a deleterious allele on one autosome affects recombination on another autosome. We find that deleterious alleles not only alter the rate but also the pattern of recombination. However, there is little support that different deleterious alleles affect recombination in a consistent manner. Because we have detailed information on individual females across their lifetimes, we are able to examine how recombination patterns change with age and find that these patterns are also affected by the presence of deleterious alleles. The differences among genotypes or among age classes are large enough to add substantial noise to genetic mapping experiments that do not consider these sources of variation.",2012,"Katherine Tedman-Aucoin, Aneil F Agrawal, Katherine Tedman-Aucoin, Aneil F Agrawal"

We also demonstrate that jointly considering spatial patterns of association among variants alongside the site-frequency spectrum is nonetheless of value. Through a comparison of models of equilibrium neutrality, nonequilibrium neutrality, equilibrium hitchhiking, nonequilibrium hitchhiking, and recurrent hitchhiking, we evaluate a linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistic (omega(max)) that appears to have power to identify regions recently shaped by positive selection.

Analogous to dHMG-D, two transcripts are observed for dHMG-Z which are differentially regulated, and are the product of zygotic transcription unlike the dHMG-D transcripts which arise from both maternal and zygotic transcription. The genes for dHMG-D and dHMG-Z are located on adjacent loci in the genome and each contains two introns.

[Transposition bursts in analysis of repeated mutations in unstable strains of Drosophila melanogaster],2840340,,"The phenomenon of transposition memory was earlier demonstrated for the cut locus and mdg4. This work has been aimed at finding out, in what way the transposition memory can be realized. An unstable stock cmMR17ctMRpN17 was analysed which had high frequency of double cm+ct+ reversions and cmMRctMRpN repeated mutations. A series of five such transpositions could be followed. The ctMRpN17 mutation is a result of insertion at the cut locus mdg4 with the jockey element inserted within it. As seen from in situ hybridization analysis, transitions to the normal phenotype correlate, as a rule, with the excision of mdg4 and the jockey from the cut locus. Analysis of distribution of mdg1, mdg2, mdg3 and jockey on the X-chromosome of unstable revertants and repeated mutants indicated that not only transpositions of mdg4 and jockey, but also those of all mobile elements tested occur. So, we propose that the transposition memory in our genetic system is manifested in the process of transposition bursts.",1988,"E Z Kochieva, T I Gerasimova, E Z Kochieva, T I Gerasimova"

Here, we demonstrate that microtubules play a key role in poleward movement of acentric chromosome fragments generated in Drosophila melanogaster neuroblasts. Acentrics segregate with either telomeres leading or lagging in equal frequency and are preferentially associated with peripheral bundled microtubules. In addition, laser ablation studies demonstrate that segregating acentrics are mechanically associated with microtubules. Finally, we show that successful acentric segregation requires the chromokinesin Klp3a. Reduced Klp3a function results in disorganized interpolar microtubules and shortened spindles. Normally, acentric poleward segregation occurs at the periphery of the spindle in association with interpolar microtubules. In klp3a mutants, acentrics fail to localize and segregate along the peripheral interpolar microtubules and are abnormally positioned in the spindle interior.

In our setup, fruit flies use a natal fruit as their origin, freely exploring for days their surroundings, which consists of a mixture of trodden and untrodden terrain. The interface between trodden and untrodden is, however, reduced in our setup to a wide doorway, opened within a surrounding wall. Crossing this doorway, characterized by a sharp contrast interface between trodden and untrodden, generates a behavior whose dynamics betrays the flies' space neophobia. The moment-by-moment dynamics of crossing is remarkably similar to that reported in mouse models of anxiety. This means that neophobic behavior is either homologous across arthropods and vertebrates or, not less interesting, convergent, whereby the same behavior is mediated in the two phyla by two completely different schemata.",2015,"Shay Cohen, Yoav Benjamini, Ilan Golani, Shay Cohen, Yoav Benjamini, Ilan Golani"

In this review we describe the evolution of our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of LAM and TSC, beginning with the discovery of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes and the demonstration of their involvement in sporadic (non-TSC) LAM. This was followed by rapid delineation of the signaling pathways in Drosophila melanogaster with confirmation in mice and humans. This knowledge served as the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches that are currently being used in human clinical trials.",2007,"Stephen C Juvet, Francis X McCormack, David J Kwiatkowski, Gregory P Downey, Stephen C Juvet, Francis X McCormack, David J Kwiatkowski, Gregory P Downey"
Methylation of tRNAAsp by the DNA methyltransferase homolog Dnmt2,16424344,10.1126/science.1120976,"The sequence and the structure of DNA methyltransferase-2 (Dnmt2) bear close affinities to authentic DNA cytosine methyltransferases. A combined genetic and biochemical approach revealed that human DNMT2 did not methylate DNA but instead methylated a small RNA; mass spectrometry showed that this RNA is aspartic acid transfer RNA (tRNA(Asp)) and that DNMT2 specifically methylated cytosine 38 in the anticodon loop. The function of DNMT2 is highly conserved, and human DNMT2 protein restored methylation in vitro to tRNA(Asp) from Dnmt2-deficient strains of mouse, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster in a manner that was dependent on preexisting patterns of modified nucleosides. Indirect sequence recognition is also a feature of eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases, which may have arisen from a Dnmt2-like RNA methyltransferase.",2006,"Mary Grace Goll, Finn Kirpekar, Keith A Maggert, Jeffrey A Yoder, Chih-Lin Hsieh, Xiaoyu Zhang, Kent G Golic, Steven E Jacobsen, Timothy H Bestor, Mary Grace Goll, Finn Kirpekar, Keith A Maggert, Jeffrey A Yoder, Chih-Lin Hsieh, Xiaoyu Zhang, Kent G Golic, Steven E Jacobsen, Timothy H Bestor"

The reaper-binding protein scythe modulates apoptosis and proliferation during mammalian development,16287848,10.1128/MCB.25.23.10329-10337.2005,"Scythe (BAT3 [HLA-B-associated transcript 3]) is a nuclear protein that has been implicated in apoptosis, as it can modulate Reaper, a central apoptotic regulator in Drosophila melanogaster. While Scythe can markedly affect Reaper-dependent apoptosis in Xenopus laevis cell extracts, the function of Scythe in mammals is unknown. Here, we report that inactivation of Scythe in the mouse results in lethality associated with pronounced developmental defects in the lung, kidney, and brain. In all cases, these developmental defects were associated with dysregulation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation. Scythe-/- cells were also more resistant to apoptosis induced by menadione and thapsigargin.

Isolation from the horse genome of a new DNA transposon belonging to the Tigger family,15170229,10.1007/s00335-004-3040-6,Tigger elements are human DNA transposons homologous to the pogo element of Drosophila melanogaster. They contain an open reading frame for a transposase very similar to the major mammalian centromere protein CENP-B. We found in the horse genome a DNA element ( Ecatig3) sharing 88% homology with human Tigger3. The presence of Tigger elements in the horse genome confirms previous data that date these elements before the divergence between Perissodactyla and Primates (80-90 Myr ago). Copy number evaluation indicates that the horse element is much more abundant than its human counterpart. Southern blot analysis demonstrates that Ecatig3 elements are extremely homogeneous; this may indicate that the evolution of this DNA transposon has been driven by some kind of selection and has not been neutral.,2004,"Marianna Paulis, Daniela Moralli, Mirella Bensi, Luigi De Carli, Elena Raimondi, Marianna Paulis, Daniela Moralli, Mirella Bensi, Luigi De Carli, Elena Raimondi"

"[Characteristics of the mutagenic action of 1,4-bis-diazoacetylbutane on mature Drosophila melanogaster sperm]",6785154,,"The mutagenic action of 1,4-bis-diazoacetylbutane was studied. No dominant lethals induced by this mutagen were detected. Up to 3.61% recessive lethal mutations were observed by the Muller-5 test. Visible mutations were detected, the majority of them having been obtained in the second generation. Four visible mutations from 11 observed concerned the eye shape and belonged to the same locus ""Lobe"" and 3 mutations--to the ""chocolate"" one. This effect might be due to the loci-specific action of the 1,4-bis-diazoacetylbutane. Three cases of replicating instability, with the stabilization of either mutant or normal state of the gene were registered. Strong morphogenic action of this mutagen has been revealed.",1981,"M M Aslanian, A I Kim, V A Smirnova, M M Aslanian, A I Kim, V A Smirnova"

Increase of rDNA redundancy in bb females of Drosophila melanogaster,820960,10.1007/BF00325821,"The purpose of this work was to analyze the difference between males and females with respect to rDNA magnification. To study eventual rDNA variations in females aYbb chromosome was chosen since it can magnify in males but not show phenomena of rDNA dosage compensation. The authors have observed an increase of rDNA pertaining to the Ybb chromosome in females of XXNO-/Ybb genotype with respect to the same Ybb chromosome studied in XXbb+/Ybb females. This non-inheritable rDNA increase cannot be explained in terms of compensatory increase reported in X/O males nor can it fit in the magnification scheme. The possibility might be entertained that some mechanism is missing in females which cannot complete a magnification cycle. The rDNA increase that we called rDNA magnification in males occurs in the germ line and in the soma, whereas the evidence, here reported, suggest that magnification in females occurs only in the soma.",1976,"S Gargano, F Graziani, S Gargano, F Graziani"

These changes eye development were transmitted through a number of successive generations without exposure to additional thermal shock, by maternal inheritance. It was established that repeated heating of oocytes and larvae of eyeless mutants whose ancestors had been subjected to similar heating during the same stages of development caused a decrease rather than the expected increase in thermal sensitivity, i.e., there was an adaptive increase in the thermostability of the eye rudiments. Thus, the effect of reheating was the opposite of that of the original heating.",1975,"P G Svetlov, G F Korsakova, P G Svetlov, G F Korsakova"

These changes have not been independent of changes in total recombination but concomitant with them. However, the changes in recombination percentages were far greater than could be accounted for by change in internode length, and the larger factor must be assumed to be changes in the coefficients of crossing over. The amounts of these changes are greatest for the mid-sections of the chromosome and least for the distal sections.

We find that models assuming purely unspecific or lysine site-specific acetylation rates were insufficient to explain the experimentally determined motif abundances. Rather, these abundances were best described by an ensemble of models with acetylation rates that were specific to motifs.

The destabilization is reflected in melting points that are lower by up to 9°C. Thermodynamic analysis and coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicate that this destabilization is due to eGFP-promoted entropic stabilization of the denatured state ensemble of EnHD. Our results provide, therefore, an example for destabilizing interdomain allostery.

Astaurov discovered spontaneous modifications based on variability in gene expression. This new approach to the phenomenon of modifications should be considered as the first stimulus to development of the general theory of variability. Contemporary classification of variability based predominantly on phenomenology encounters many contradictions. The same specific molecular mechanisms may be responsible, for example, for both hereditary and nonhereditary variability depending on the taxonomic status. Some mechanisms responsible for both mutations and modifications or for mutations, recombination, and ontogenetic variability have been considered from this viewpoint. It may well be more productive to consider different types of variability with respect to the main genetic processes: replication and expression of genetic material.",2005,"S G Inge-Vechtomov, S G Inge-Vechtomov"

In response, gender-limited reproductive genes are selected to ameliorate, through pleiotropy, the expression of sexually antagonistic genes.

"Masters change, slaves remain",12508274,10.1002/bies.10207,"Sex determination offers an opportunity to address many classic questions of developmental biology. In addition, because sex determination evolves rapidly, it offers an opportunity to investigate the evolution of genetic hierarchies.

DmSxl controls the alternative splicing of a downstream gene, transformer (tra), which acts with tra2 to control alternative splicing of doublesex (dsx). DmSxl also controls its own splicing, creating an autoregulatory feedback loop that ensures expression of Sxl in females, but not males. A recent paper has shown that in the dipteran Ceratitis capitata later (downstream) steps in the regulatory hierarchy are conserved, while earlier (upstream) steps are not. Cctra is regulated by alternative splicing and apparently controls the alternative splicing of Ccdsx. However, Cctra is not regulated by CcSxl.

Moreover, egg deposition by adult females was also retarded and/or drastically reduced. These effects show similarity to sublethal effects described for certain ""insecticidal"" octopamine receptor agonists, such as formamidines and phenyliminoimidazolidines.

Male fitness increases when females are eliminated from gene pool: implications for the Y chromosome,9600945,10.1073/pnas.95.11.6217,"Because the two sexes share a common gene pool while performing many different biological functions, mutations benefiting one sex may not accumulate due to counter selection in the other sex. In these experiments 99% of a haploid genome of Drosophila melanogaster was constrained to segregate like a male-limited Y chromosome for 41 generations, thereby eliminating potential counter selection in females. The synthetic Y chromosomes rapidly accumulated genetic variation that increased male fitness and decreased female fitness. The survival and fertility of females declined when they were mated to males expressing the synthetic Y chromosomes. These results suggests that opposing selection between the sexes may substantially interfere with sex-specific adaptation. They also demonstrate how intersexual evolutionary conflict can lead to perpetual degeneration of the Y via genetic hitchhiking of deleterious mutations.",1998,"W R Rice, W R Rice"

General characteristics of the polytene chromosome from ovarian pseudonurse cells of the Drosophila melanogaster otu11 and fs(2)B mutants,7780663,10.1007/BF00710713,"Polytene chromosomes of good cytological quality from pseudonurse cells (PNCs) of fs(2)B and otu11 mutants were obtained, photomaps for otu11 mutants were constructed and the general characteristics of polytene chromosomes from salivary glands (SGs) and PNCs were compared. Three conditions were found to improve the cytological quality of PNC chromosomes: temperature below 18 degrees C, a protein-rich medium and presence of the Y-chromosome. Detailed comparison of the chromosome banding pattern from SGs and PNCs has shown only minor differences between them. The frequency of asynapsis appeared to be 10 times higher for PNC chromosomes. Despite previous reports, features such as breaks and ectopic contacts turned out to be also typical for PNC chromosomes, but with remarkably lower frequencies.",1995,"N I Mal'ceva, H Gyurkovics, I F Zhimulev, N I Mal'ceva, H Gyurkovics, I F Zhimulev"
Resistance-associated point mutations in insecticide-insensitive acetylcholinesterase,8016090,10.1073/pnas.91.13.5922,"Extensive utilization of pesticides against insects provides us with a good model for studying the adaptation of a eukaryotic genome to a strong selective pressure. One mechanism of resistance is the alteration of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7), the molecular target for organophosphates and carbamates. Here, we report the sequence analysis of the Ace gene in several resistant field strains of Drosophila melanogaster. This analysis resulted in the identification of five point mutations associated with reduced sensitivities to insecticides. In some cases, several of these mutations were found to be combined in the same protein, leading to different resistance patterns. Our results suggest that recombination between resistant alleles preexisting in natural populations is a mechanism by which insects rapidly adapt to new selective pressures.",1994,"A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride, D Fournier, A Mutero, M Pralavorio, J M Bride, D Fournier"
Germ-line determination in Caenorhabditis and Ascaris: will a helicase begin to unravel the mystery?,15275493,10.1016/0169-4758(94)90011-6,"How cell lineages are established during development in higher eukaryotes is being addressed by geneticists and by developmental and molecular biologists.

A putative RNA helicase, glh-I r which appears germ-line specific in its expression, has recently been reported from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.

Circadian oscillations in period gene mRNA levels are transcriptionally regulated,1465387,10.1073/pnas.89.24.11711,"The period (per) gene is involved in regulating circadian rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster. The per gene is expressed in a circadian manner, where fluctuations in per mRNA abundance are influenced by its own translation product, which also cycles in abundance. Since per gene expression is necessary for circadian rhythmicity, we sought to determine how certain features of this feedback loop operate. The results of this study reveal that fluctuations in per mRNA are primarily controlled by fluctuations in per gene transcription, that per mRNA has a relatively short half-life, and that sequences sufficient to drive per mRNA cycling are present in 1.3 kilobases of 5' flanking sequences. These and other results indicate that the per feedback loop has all of the basic properties necessary to be a component of a circadian oscillator.",1992,"P E Hardin, J C Hall, M Rosbash, P E Hardin, J C Hall, M Rosbash"
P regulatory products repress in vivo the P promoter activity in P-lacZ fusion genes,1852009,10.1073/pnas.88.10.4419,The transposition of P elements in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by products encoded by the P elements themselves. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation are complex and still unclear. We have assayed in vivo the effects of P regulatory products on the P promoter itself by using P-lacZ fusion genes. We have found that all the P-lacZ insertions are repressed in a P background. This repression occurs in all the tissues observed and at all the developmental stages. The amount of transcripts specific for P-lacZ is substantially reduced in a P background. These results suggest that P trans-acting products can exert a direct repression on the P promoter transcription.,1991,"B Lemaitre, D Coen, B Lemaitre, D Coen"

Developmental effects of modifiers of the vg mutant in Drosophila melanogaster,2513153,10.1002/dvg.1020100506,"An analysis of the modifiers affecting the expression of the vg gene was performed.

The selection for enlarged wings was more effective in the vg B population where wild wings appeared from the 10th generation. The assay of the three major chromosomes showed that the modifiers are located on chromosomes 2 and 3.

Maximum likelihood estimation of segregation parameters revealed two lines in which the proportion of X-bearing gametes produced by males was significantly different from Mendelian expectations.

Molecular characterization of ribosomal genes on the Ybb- chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,6813192,,"The question of whether the Ybb- chromosome contains ribosomal genes has been examined by using Southern blot analysis and comparing rDNA hybridization patterns for X/X and X/Ybb- DNA. The results demonstrate that the Ybb- chromosome contains sequences that hybridize to an rDNA probe under stringent conditions. Differential hybridization of some of these sequences with DNAs corresponding to different regions of a complete ribosomal gene repeat provides evidence that some of the genes on the Ybb- chromosome are type 2 repeats. Because data obtained by other workers suggest that type 2 repeats are transcribed only to low levels, these repeats may be classed as ""nonfunctional"". A further finding is that the ribosomal genes on the Ybb- chromosome do not undergo multiple rounds of DNA replication during polytenization of X/Ybb- cells.",1982,"S A Endow, S A Endow"

PGMA is more thermostable than PGMB but shows the same pH optimum, equal dependence on Mg2+, and identical molecular weight. There is no significant kinetic difference between the two allozymes at the optimum pH values, but at pH 6.0 the Km value for glucose-1,6-diphosphate of PGMB is significantly higher than that of PGMA.

In situ hybridization of 3H-RNA from salivary gland nuclei labels all three types of chromosomal sites. Labeling by in situ hybridization is not proportional to labeling by direct autoradiography. The differences may be explained by several models. Nuclear RNA of salivary glands probably contains transcripts from multiply repeated genes; these transcripts may hybridize to many chromosomal sites. The data furthermore suggest that the phenomenon of puffing may not be a simple reflection of transcription rate, since several puffs hybridize RNAs with quite different metabolic characteristics.",1977,"J J Bonner, M L Pardue, J J Bonner, M L Pardue"

A meiotic mutant defective in distributive disjunction in Drosophila melanogaster,4633612,,"The female meiotic mutant no distributive disjunction (symbol: nod) reduces the probability that a nonexchange chromosome will disjoin from either a nonexchange homolog or a nonhomolog; the mutant does not affect exchange or the disjunction of bivalents that have undergone exchange.

The results suggest that the defect in nod is in the distributive pairing process. The frequencies and patterns of disjunction from a trivalent in nod females suggest that the distributive pairing process involves three separate events-pairing, orientation, and disjunction. The mutant nod appears to affect disjunction only.",1973,"A T Carpenter, A T Carpenter"

FlyXCDB-A Resource for Drosophila Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins and Their Extracellular Domains,29890119,10.1016/j.jmb.2018.06.002,"Genomes of metazoan organisms possess a large number of genes encoding cell surface and secreted (CSS) proteins that carry out crucial functions in cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, extracellular matrix establishment, nutrient digestion and uptake, immunity, and developmental processes.

More than 300 Drosophila XC domains were discovered in Drosophila CSS proteins encoded by over 2500 genes through analyses of computational predictions of signal peptide, transmembrane (TM) segment, and GPI-anchor signal sequence, profile-based sequence similarity searches, gene ontology, and literature. These domains were classified into six classes mainly based on their molecular functions, including protein-protein interactions (class P), signaling molecules (class S), binding of non-protein molecules or groups (class B), enzyme homologs (class E), enzyme regulation and inhibition (class R), and unknown molecular function (class U). Main cellular functions such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, and extracellular matrix composition were described for the most abundant domains in each functional class. We assigned cell membrane topology categories (E, secreted; S, type I/III single-pass TM; T, type II single-pass TM; M, multi-pass TM; and G, GPI-anchored) to the products of genes with XC domains and investigated their regulation by mechanisms such as alternative splicing and stop codon readthrough.",2018,"Jimin Pei, Lisa N Kinch, Nick V Grishin, Jimin Pei, Lisa N Kinch, Nick V Grishin"
The Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits Dα5 and Dα7 form functional homomeric and heteromeric ion channels,22727315,10.1186/1471-2202-13-73,"Background:
      
    

    
      Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role as excitatory neurotransmitters in vertebrate and invertebrate species. In insects, nAChRs are the site of action of commercially important insecticides and, as a consequence, there is considerable interest in examining their functional properties. However, problems have been encountered in the successful functional expression of insect nAChRs, although a number of strategies have been developed in an attempt to overcome such difficulties. Ten nAChR subunits have been identified in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster (Dα1-Dα7 and Dβ1-Dβ3) and a similar number have been identified in other insect species. The focus of the present study is the Dα5, Dα6 and Dα7 subunits, which are distinguished by their sequence similarity to one another and also by their close similarity to the vertebrate α7 nAChR subunit.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A full-length cDNA clone encoding the Drosophila nAChR Dα5 subunit has been isolated and the properties of Dα5-, Dα6- and Dα7-containing nAChRs examined in a variety of cell expression systems. We have demonstrated the functional expression, as homomeric nAChRs, of the Dα5 and Dα7 subunits in Xenopus oocytes by their co-expression with the molecular chaperone RIC-3. Also, using a similar approach, we have demonstrated the functional expression of a heteromeric 'triplet' nAChR (Dα5 + Dα6 + Dα7) with substantially higher apparent affinity for acetylcholine than is seen with other subunit combinations. In addition, specific cell-surface binding of [125I]-α-bungarotoxin was detected in both Drosophila and mammalian cell lines when Dα5 was co-expressed with Dα6 and RIC-3. In contrast, co-expression of additional subunits (including Dα7) with Dα5 and Dα6 prevented specific binding of [125I]-α-bungarotoxin in cell lines, suggesting that co-assembly with other nAChR subunits can block maturation of correctly folded nAChRs in some cellular environments.

Flock house virus induces apoptosis by depletion of Drosophila inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein DIAP1,17989181,10.1128/JVI.01941-07,"The molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses induce apoptosis and apoptosis-associated pathology are not fully understood. Here we show that flock house virus (FHV), one of the simplest RNA viruses (family, Nodaviridae), induces robust apoptosis of permissive Drosophila Line-1 (DL-1) cells. To define the pathway by which FHV triggers apoptosis in this model invertebrate system, we investigated the potential role of Drosophila apoptotic effectors during infection. Suggesting the involvement of host caspases, the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) prevented FHV-induced cytopathology and prolonged cell survival. RNA interference-mediated ablation of the principal Drosophila effector caspase DrICE or its upstream initiator caspase DRONC prevented FHV-induced apoptosis and demonstrated direct participation of this intrinsic caspase pathway. Prior to the FHV-induced activation of DrICE, the intracellular level of inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) protein DIAP1, the principal caspase regulator in Drosophila melanogaster, was dramatically reduced. DIAP1 was depleted despite z-VAD-fmk-mediated caspase inhibition during infection, suggesting that the loss of DIAP1 was caused by an upstream FHV-induced signal. The RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DIAP1 caused rapid and uniform apoptosis of DL-1 cells and thus indicated that DIAP1 depletion is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. Confirming this conclusion, the elevation of intracellular DIAP1 levels in stable diap1-transfected cells blocked caspase activation and prevented FHV-induced apoptosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that DIAP1 is a critical sensor of virus infection, which upon virus-signaled depletion relieves caspase inhibition, which subsequently executes apoptotic death. Thus, our study supports the hypothesis that altering the level or the activity of cellular IAP proteins is a general mechanism by which RNA viruses trigger apoptosis.",2008,"Erik W Settles, Paul D Friesen, Erik W Settles, Paul D Friesen"
"Positive selection of Iris, a retroviral envelope-derived host gene in Drosophila melanogaster",16244705,10.1371/journal.pgen.0010044,"Eukaryotic genomes can usurp enzymatic functions encoded by mobile elements for their own use. A particularly interesting kind of acquisition involves the domestication of retroviral envelope genes, which confer infectious membrane-fusion ability to retroviruses. So far, these examples have been limited to vertebrate genomes, including primates where the domesticated envelope is under purifying selection to assist placental function. Here, we show that in Drosophila genomes, a previously unannotated gene (CG4715, renamed Iris) was domesticated from a novel, active Kanga lineage of insect retroviruses at least 25 million years ago, and has since been maintained as a host gene that is expressed in all adult tissues. Iris and the envelope genes from Kanga retroviruses are homologous to those found in insect baculoviruses and gypsy and roo insect retroviruses. Two separate envelope domestications from the Kanga and roo retroviruses have taken place, in fruit fly and mosquito genomes, respectively. Whereas retroviral envelopes are proteolytically cleaved into the ligand-interaction and membrane-fusion domains, Iris appears to lack this cleavage site. In the takahashii/suzukii species groups of Drosophila, we find that Iris has tandemly duplicated to give rise to two genes (Iris-A and Iris-B). Iris-B has significantly diverged from the Iris-A lineage, primarily because of the ""invention"" of an intron de novo in what was previously exonic sequence. Unlike domesticated retroviral envelope genes in mammals, we find that Iris has been subject to strong positive selection between Drosophila species. The rapid, adaptive evolution of Iris is sufficient to unambiguously distinguish the phylogenies of three closely related sibling species of Drosophila (D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana), a discriminative power previously described only for a putative ""speciation gene."" Iris represents the first instance of a retroviral envelope-derived host gene outside vertebrates. It is also the first example of a retroviral envelope gene that has been found to be subject to positive selection following its domestication. The unusual selective pressures acting on Iris suggest that it is an active participant in an ongoing genetic conflict. We propose a model in which Iris has ""switched sides,"" having been recruited by host genomes to combat baculoviruses and retroviruses, which employ homologous envelope genes to mediate infection.",2005,"Harmit S Malik, Steven Henikoff, Harmit S Malik, Steven Henikoff"
Peptidomic and proteomic analyses of the systemic immune response of Drosophila,15556270,10.1016/j.biochi.2004.07.007,"Insects have developed an efficient host defense against microorganisms, which involves humoral and cellular mechanisms. Numerous data highlight similarities between defense responses of insects and innate immunity of mammals. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a favorable model system for the analysis of the first line defense against microorganisms. Taking advantages of improvements in mass spectrometry (MS), two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and bioinformatics, differential analyses of blood content (hemolymph) from immune-challenged versus control Drosophila were performed. Two strategies were developed: (i) peptidomic analyses through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS and high performance liquid chromatography for molecules below 15 kDa, and (ii) proteomic studies based on 2D gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF fingerprinting and database searches, for compounds of greater molecular masses. The peptidomic strategy led to the detection of a large number of peptides induced in the hemolymph of challenged flies as compared to controls. Of these, 28 were characterized, amongst which were antimicrobial peptides. The 2D gel electrophoresis strategy led to the detection of 70 spots differentially regulated by at least fivefold after microbial infection. This approach yielded the identity of a series of proteins that were related to the Drosophila immune response, such as proteases, protease inhibitors, prophenoloxydase-activating enzymes, serpins and a Gram-negative binding protein-like protein. This strategy also brought to light new candidates with a potential function in the immune response (odorant-binding protein, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase and transferrin). Interestingly, several molecules resulting from the cleavage of proteins were detected after a fungal infection. Together, peptidomic and proteomic analyses represent new tools to characterize molecules involved in the innate immune reactions of Drosophila.",2004,"Francine Levy, David Rabel, Maurice Charlet, Philippe Bulet, Jules A Hoffmann, Laurence Ehret-Sabatier, Francine Levy, David Rabel, Maurice Charlet, Philippe Bulet, Jules A Hoffmann, Laurence Ehret-Sabatier"
Histone deposition pathways determine the chromatin landscapes of H3.1 and H3.3 K27M oncohistones,32902381,10.7554/eLife.61090,"Lysine 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutations in the H3.1 or H3.3 histone genes are characteristic of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). These oncohistone mutations dominantly inhibit histone H3K27 trimethylation and silencing, but it is unknown how oncohistone type affects gliomagenesis. We show that the genomic distributions of H3.1 and H3.3 oncohistones in human patient-derived DMG cells are consistent with the DNA replication-coupled deposition of histone H3.1 and the predominant replication-independent deposition of histone H3.3. Although H3K27 trimethylation is reduced for both oncohistone types, H3.3K27M-bearing cells retain some domains, and only H3.1K27M-bearing cells lack H3K27 trimethylation. Neither oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding. Using Drosophila as a model, we demonstrate that inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation occurs only when H3K27M oncohistones are deposited into chromatin and only when expressed in cycling cells. We propose that oncohistones inhibit the H3K27 methyltransferase as chromatin patterns are being duplicated in proliferating cells, predisposing them to tumorigenesis.",2020,"Jay F Sarthy, Michael P Meers, Derek H Janssens, Jorja G Henikoff, Heather Feldman, Patrick J Paddison, Christina M Lockwood, Nicholas A Vitanza, James M Olson, Kami Ahmad, Steven Henikoff, Jay F Sarthy, Michael P Meers, Derek H Janssens, Jorja G Henikoff, Heather Feldman, Patrick J Paddison, Christina M Lockwood, Nicholas A Vitanza, James M Olson, Kami Ahmad, Steven Henikoff"

We test the hypothesis that, in neuronal stem cells, temporal transcription factors predictably control neuronal terminal features and circuit assembly. Using the Drosophila motor system, we manipulate expression of the classic temporal transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) specifically in the NB7-1 stem cell, which produces U motor neurons (MNs), and then we monitor dendrite morphology and neuromuscular synaptic partnerships. We find that prolonged expression of Hb leads to transient specification of U MN identity, and that embryonic molecular markers do not accurately predict U MN terminal features. Nonetheless, our data show Hb acts as a potent regulator of neuromuscular wiring decisions. These data introduce important refinements to current models, show that molecular information acts early in neurogenesis as a switch to control motor circuit wiring, and provide novel insight into the relationship between stem cell and circuit.",2019,"Julia L Meng, Zarion D Marshall, Meike Lobb-Rabe, Ellie S Heckscher, Julia L Meng, Zarion D Marshall, Meike Lobb-Rabe, Ellie S Heckscher"
Neurotransmitter identity is acquired in a lineage-restricted manner in the Drosophila CNS,30912745,10.7554/eLife.43701,"The vast majority of the adult fly ventral nerve cord is composed of 34 hemilineages, which are clusters of lineally related neurons.

We generated a comprehensive neurotransmitter usage map for the entire ventral nerve cord. We did not find any cases of neurons using more than one neurotransmitter, but found that the acetylcholine specific gene ChAT is transcribed in many glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but these transcripts typically do not leave the nucleus and are not translated. Importantly, our work uncovered a simple rule: All neurons within a hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter. Thus, neurotransmitter identity is acquired at the stem cell level.

However, introns and the concomitant need for splicing extend the time required for gene expression and can cause an undesirable delay in the activation of genes. Here, we show that the plant microRNA processing factor SERRATE (SE) plays an unexpected and pivotal role in the regulation of intronless genes. Arabidopsis SE associated with more than 1000, mainly intronless, genes in a transcription-dependent manner. Chromatin-bound SE liaised with paused and elongating polymerase II complexes and promoted their association with intronless target genes. Our results indicate that stress-responsive genes contain no or few introns, which negatively affects their expression strength, but that some genes circumvent this limitation via a novel SE-dependent transcriptional activation mechanism. Transcriptome analysis of a Drosophila mutant defective in ARS2, the metazoan homologue of SE, suggests that SE/ARS2 function in regulating intronless genes might be conserved across kingdoms.",2018,"Corinna Speth, Emese Xochitl Szabo, Claudia Martinho, Silvio Collani, Sven Zur Oven-Krockhaus, Sandra Richter, Irina Droste-Borel, Boris Macek, York-Dieter Stierhof, Markus Schmid, Chang Liu, Sascha Laubinger, Corinna Speth, Emese Xochitl Szabo, Claudia Martinho, Silvio Collani, Sven Zur Oven-Krockhaus, Sandra Richter, Irina Droste-Borel, Boris Macek, York-Dieter Stierhof, Markus Schmid, Chang Liu, Sascha Laubinger"
Recruitment of two dyneins to an mRNA-dependent Bicaudal D transport complex,29944116,10.7554/eLife.36306,"We investigated the role of full-length Drosophila Bicaudal D (BicD) binding partners in dynein-dynactin activation for mRNA transport on microtubules. Full-length BicD robustly activated dynein-dynactin motility only when both the mRNA binding protein Egalitarian (Egl) and K10 mRNA cargo were present, and electron microscopy showed that both Egl and mRNA were needed to disrupt a looped, auto-inhibited BicD conformation. BicD can recruit two dimeric dyneins, resulting in faster speeds and longer runs than with one dynein. Moving complexes predominantly contained two Egl molecules and one K10 mRNA. This mRNA-bound configuration makes Egl bivalent, likely enhancing its avidity for BicD and thus its ability to disrupt BicD auto-inhibition. Consistent with this idea, artificially dimerized Egl activates dynein-dynactin-BicD in the absence of mRNA. The ability of mRNA cargo to orchestrate the activation of the mRNP (messenger ribonucleotide protein) complex is an elegant way to ensure that only cargo-bound motors are motile.",2018,"Thomas E Sladewski, Neil Billington, M Yusuf Ali, Carol S Bookwalter, Hailong Lu, Elena B Krementsova, Trina A Schroer, Kathleen M Trybus, Thomas E Sladewski, Neil Billington, M Yusuf Ali, Carol S Bookwalter, Hailong Lu, Elena B Krementsova, Trina A Schroer, Kathleen M Trybus"
Vibrator and PI4KIIIα govern neuroblast polarity by anchoring non-muscle myosin II,29482721,10.7554/eLife.33555,"A central feature of most stem cells is the ability to self-renew and undergo differentiation via asymmetric division. However, during asymmetric division the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids and their regulators is not well established. Here, we show that the sole type I PI transfer protein, Vibrator, controls asymmetric division of Drosophilaneural stem cells (NSCs) by physically anchoring myosin II regulatory light chain, Sqh, to the NSC cortex. Depletion of vib or disruption of its lipid binding and transfer activities disrupts NSC polarity. We propose that Vib stimulates PI4KIIIα to promote synthesis of a plasma membrane pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] that, in turn, binds and anchors myosin to the NSC cortex. Remarkably, Sqh also binds to PI(4)P in vitro and both Vib and Sqh mediate plasma membrane localization of PI(4)P in NSCs.

Protein Phosphatase 1 inactivates Mps1 to ensure efficient Spindle Assembly Checkpoint silencing,28463114,10.7554/eLife.25366,"Faithfull genome partitioning during cell division relies on the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC), a conserved signaling pathway that delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are attached to spindle microtubules. Mps1 kinase is an upstream SAC regulator that promotes the assembly of an anaphase inhibitor through a sequential multi-target phosphorylation cascade. Thus, the SAC is highly responsive to Mps1, whose activity peaks in early mitosis as a result of its T-loop autophosphorylation. However, the mechanism controlling Mps1 inactivation once kinetochores attach to microtubules and the SAC is satisfied remains unknown. Here we show in vitro and in Drosophila that Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) inactivates Mps1 by dephosphorylating its T-loop. PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of Mps1 occurs at kinetochores and in the cytosol, and inactivation of both pools of Mps1 during metaphase is essential to ensure prompt and efficient SAC silencing.

MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2,28095293,10.7554/eLife.22540,"Injury-induced (Wallerian) axonal degeneration is regulated via the opposing actions of pro-degenerative factors such as SARM1 and a MAPK signal and pro-survival factors, the most important of which is the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT2 that inhibits activation of the SARM1 pathway. Here we investigate the mechanism by which MAPK signaling facilitates axonal degeneration. We show that MAPK signaling promotes the turnover of the axonal survival factor NMNAT2 in cultured mammalian neurons as well as the Drosophila ortholog dNMNAT in motoneurons. The increased levels of NMNAT2 are required for the axonal protection caused by loss of MAPK signaling. Regulation of NMNAT2 by MAPK signaling does not require SARM1, and so cannot be downstream of SARM1. Hence, pro-degenerative MAPK signaling functions upstream of SARM1 by limiting the levels of the essential axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to promote injury-dependent SARM1 activation. These findings are consistent with a linear molecular pathway for the axonal degeneration program.",2017,"Lauren J Walker, Daniel W Summers, Yo Sasaki, E J Brace, Jeffrey Milbrandt, Aaron DiAntonio, Lauren J Walker, Daniel W Summers, Yo Sasaki, E J Brace, Jeffrey Milbrandt, Aaron DiAntonio"
Sex difference in pathology of the ageing gut mediates the greater response of female lifespan to dietary restriction,26878754,10.7554/eLife.10956,"Women live on average longer than men but have greater levels of late-life morbidity. We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in Drosophila. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell (ISC) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction.",2016,"Jennifer C Regan, Mobina Khericha, Adam J Dobson, Ekin Bolukbasi, Nattaphong Rattanavirotkul, Linda Partridge, Jennifer C Regan, Mobina Khericha, Adam J Dobson, Ekin Bolukbasi, Nattaphong Rattanavirotkul, Linda Partridge"

Here, we used combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This network reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis. Moreover, it revealed that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction that we show is conserved in human cancer cells.

By treating the cultures with rapamycin (Rap) and chloroquine (CQ) we induced an autophagic response, fully suppressible by knockdown of core ATG genes. We screened D. melanogaster orthologs of a previously reported mammalian autophagy protein-protein interaction network, identifying several proteins required for autophagosome formation in muscle cells, including orthologs of the Rab regulators RabGap1 and Rab3Gap1. The screen also highlighted the critical roles of the proteasome and glycogen metabolism in regulating autophagy. Specifically, sustained proteasome inhibition inhibited autophagosome formation both in primary culture and larval skeletal muscle, even though autophagy normally acts to suppress ubiquitin aggregate formation in these tissues. In addition, analyses of glycogen metabolic genes in both primary cultured and larval muscles indicated that glycogen storage enhances the autophagic response to starvation, an important insight given the link between glycogen storage disorders, autophagy, and muscle function.",2015,"Jonathan Zirin, Joppe Nieuwenhuis, Anastasia Samsonova, Rong Tao, Norbert Perrimon, Jonathan Zirin, Joppe Nieuwenhuis, Anastasia Samsonova, Rong Tao, Norbert Perrimon"

Tolerance and utilization capacity of several alcohols and of acetic acid were analyzed in a total of 10 local populations. Results on two other species (D. repleta and D. immigrans) were also available from one place. In each locality, the population from alcohol rich habitat proved to be more tolerant to all the investigated products and also to be more capable of using them as a resource. Alcohols toxicity increased with increasing carbon chain length and secondary alcohols were more toxic than primary ones. Utilization capacity of all products was relatively independent of their toxicity. Especially acetic acid, the toxicity of which was low and similar to that of ethanol, was always a fairly poor resource. From a genetic point of view, tolerance and utilization capacity appeared as two relatively independent traits. Natural selection, which is responsible for the genetic differentiation of local populations, is likely to act simultaneously on both traits.",1999,"D Karan, R Parkash, J R David, D Karan, R Parkash, J R David"

When a hsp82 heat shock promoter-Mos1 construct was used to supply mariner transposase, excision products were also recovered from the Queensland fruitfly Bactrocera tryoni. Analysis of DNA sequences at empty excision sites led us to hypothesise that the mariner excision/repair process involves the formation of a heteroduplex at the excision breakpoint.

A mechanism for hunchback promoters to readout morphogenetic positional information in less than a minute,32723476,10.7554/eLife.49758,"Cell fate decisions in the fly embryo are rapid: hunchback genes decide in minutes whether nuclei follow the anterior/posterior developmental blueprint by reading out positional information in the Bicoid morphogen. This developmental system is a prototype of regulatory decision processes that combine speed and accuracy. Traditional arguments based on fixed-time sampling of Bicoid concentration indicate that an accurate readout is impossible within the experimental times. This raises the general issue of how speed-accuracy tradeoffs are achieved. Here, we compare fixed-time to on-the-fly decisions, based on comparing the likelihoods of anterior/posterior locations. We found that these more efficient schemes complete reliable cell fate decisions within the short embryological timescales. We discuss the influence of promoter architectures on decision times and error rates, present concrete examples that rapidly readout the morphogen, and predictions for new experiments.

Here we have adapted single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) for use in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc in order to measure nascent and mature mRNA of genes downstream of the Wg and Dpp morphogen gradients. We compared our experimental results with predictions from stochastic models of transcription, which indicated that the transcription levels of these genes appear to share a common method of control via burst frequency modulation.

Cohesin controls intestinal stem cell identity by maintaining association of Escargot with target promoters,32022682,10.7554/eLife.48160,"Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) maintain regenerative capacity of the intestinal epithelium. Their function and activity are regulated by transcriptional changes, yet how such changes are coordinated at the genomic level remains unclear. The Cohesin complex regulates transcription globally by generating topologically-associated DNA domains (TADs) that link promotor regions with distant enhancers. We show here that the Cohesin complex prevents premature differentiation of Drosophila ISCs into enterocytes (ECs). Depletion of the Cohesin subunit Rad21 and the loading factor Nipped-B triggers an ISC to EC differentiation program that is independent of Notch signaling, but can be rescued by over-expression of the ISC-specific escargot (esg) transcription factor. Using damID and transcriptomic analysis, we find that Cohesin regulates Esg binding to promoters of differentiation genes, including a group of Notch target genes involved in ISC differentiation.

We find that depletion of Ubx leads to the de-repression of genes normally expressed in other lineages. Ubx silences expression of alternative fate genes by retaining the Polycomb Group protein Pleiohomeotic at Ubx targeted genomic regions, thereby stabilizing repressive chromatin marks in a lineage-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates that Ubx stabilizes lineage choice by suppressing the multipotency encoded in the genome via its interaction with Pho.

We had previously found that upward-sensitive T4 cells implement both preferred direction enhancement and null direction suppression (Haag et al., 2016). Here, we asked whether this mechanism generalizes to OFF-selective T5 cells and to all four subtypes of both cell classes. We found that all four subtypes of both T4 and T5 cells implement both mechanisms, that is preferred direction enhancement and null direction inhibition, on opposing sides of their receptive fields.

LTE induction requires activation of at least three signaling pathways to the MBs, mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), NMDA receptors (NRs), and D1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs). Here, we demonstrate that inputs from the AL are transmitted to the MBs through nAChRs, and inputs from the AFV are transmitted by NRs. Dopamine signaling occurs downstream of both nAChR and NR activation, and requires simultaneous stimulation of both pathways. Dopamine release requires the activity of the rutabaga adenylyl cyclase in postsynaptic MB neurons, and release is restricted to MB neurons that receive coincident stimulation.

However, the mechanism by which illumination is coupled to rhabdomere turnover remains unclear. We find that photoreceptors contain a light-dependent phospholipase D (PLD) activity. During illumination, loss of PLD resulted in an enhanced reduction in rhabdomere size, accumulation of Rab7 positive, rhodopsin1-containing vesicles (RLVs) in the cell body and reduced rhodopsin protein. These phenotypes were associated with reduced levels of phosphatidic acid, the product of PLD activity and were rescued by reconstitution with catalytically active PLD. In wild-type photoreceptors, during illumination, enhanced PLD activity was sufficient to clear RLVs from the cell body by a process dependent on Arf1-GTP levels and retromer complex function.

The results of two interspecific tests were also correlated, but the intraspecific vs. interspecific test result comparisons ranged from highly significant to nonsignificant correlations. For the fitness estimates, the overall variances produced by the intraspecific tests were greater than those obtained in the interspecific competitions. No significant correlations were found between the results of a long-term (multi-generation) competitive assessment of fitness and any of the single-generation tests.

Sex-specific control of Sex-lethal is a conserved mechanism for sex determination in the genus Drosophila,8631274,,"In D. melanogaster the binary switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) plays a pivotal role in somatic sex determination -- when the Sxl gene is on the female pathway is followed, while the male pathway is followed when the gene is off. In the present study we have asked whether the Sxl gene is present in other species of the genus Drosophila and whether it is subject to a similar sex-specific on-off regulation. Sxl proteins were found in all of the drosophilids examined, and they display a sex-specific pattern of expression. Furthermore, characterization of the Sxl gene in the distant drosophilan relative, D. virilis, reveals that the structure and sequence organization of the gene has been well conserved and that, like melanogaster, alternative RNA processing is responsible for its sex-specific expression. Hence, this posttranscriptional on-off regulatory mechanism probably existed before the separation of the drosophilan and sophophoran subgenera and it seems likely that Sxl functions as a sex determination switch gene in most species in the Drosophila genus. Although alternative splicing appears to be responsible for the on-off regulation of the Sxl gene in D. virilis, this species is unusual in that Sxl proteins are present not only in females but also in males. The D. virilis female and male proteins appear to be identical over most of the length except for the amino-terminal approx. 25 aa which are encoded by the differentially spliced exons. In transcriptionally active polytene chromosomes, the male and female proteins bind to the same cytogenetic loci, including the sites corresponding to the D. virilis Sxl and tra genes. Hence, though the male proteins are able to interact with appropriate target pre-mRNAs, they are apparently incapable of altering the splicing pattern of these pre-mRNAs.",1996,"D Bopp, G Calhoun, J I Horabin, M Samuels, P Schedl, D Bopp, G Calhoun, J I Horabin, M Samuels, P Schedl"
Circadian Modulation of Alcohol-Induced Sedation and Recovery in Male and Female Drosophila,26833081,10.1177/0748730415627067,"Delineating the factors that affect behavioral and neurological responses to alcohol is critical to facilitate measures for preventing or treating alcohol abuse. The high degree of conserved molecular and physiological processes makes Drosophila melanogaster a valuable model for investigating circadian interactions with alcohol-induced behaviors and examining sex-specific differences in alcohol sensitivity. We found that wild-type Drosophila exhibited rhythms in alcohol-induced sedation under light-dark and constant dark conditions with considerably greater alcohol exposure necessary to induce sedation during the late (subjective) day and peak sensitivity to alcohol occurring during the late (subjective) night. The circadian clock also modulated the recovery from alcohol-induced sedation with flies regaining motor control significantly faster during the late (subjective) day. As predicted, the circadian rhythms in sedation and recovery were absent in flies with a mutation in the circadian gene period or arrhythmic flies housed in constant light conditions. Flies lacking a functional circadian clock were more sensitive to the effects of alcohol with significantly longer recovery times. Similar to other animals and humans, Drosophila exhibit sex-specific differences in alcohol sensitivity. We investigated whether the circadian clock modulated the rhythms in the loss-of-righting reflex, alcohol-induced sedation, and recovery differently in males and females. We found that both sexes demonstrated circadian rhythms in the loss-of-righting reflex and sedation with the differences in alcohol sensitivity between males and females most pronounced during the late subjective day. Recovery of motor reflexes following alcohol sedation also exhibited circadian modulation in male and female flies, although the circadian clock did not modulate the difference in recovery times between the sexes.

      GGAs (Golgi-localised, γ-ear containing, ADP ribosylation factor-binding) are a family of clathrin adaptors that sort a number of biologically important transmembrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles. Knockout and knockdown studies to determine GGA function are confounded by the fact that there are 3 GGA genes in mammalian cells. Thus Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model system to study tissue expression profiles and knockdown phenotypes as there is a single GGA ortholog.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we have quantified protein expression in Drosophila and show that there is >3-fold higher expression of GGA in male flies relative to female flies. In female flies the majority of GGA expression is in the head. In male flies GGA is not only expressed at high levels in the head but there is a gender specific increased expression which is due to the abundant expression of GGA in the testes. Using a highly specific antibody we have localised endogenous GGA protein in testes squashes, and visualised it in somatic and germ line cells. We show that GGA is expressed during multiple stages of sperm development, and co-stains with a marker of the trans-Golgi Network. This is most striking at the acroblast of early spermatids. In spite of the high expression of GGA in testes, knocking down its expression by >95% using transgenic RNAi fly lines did not affect male fertility. Therefore spermatogenesis in the male flies appears to progress normally with <5% GGA, most likely because alternative adaptors may be able to substitute partially or completely for the function of GGA. We also identify 'cueball' as a novel cargo for GGA, and mutants of cueball have been shown to have a male sterility phenotype.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila we have uncovered a potential role for GGA in the testes of male flies. The gender specific higher expression of GGA, its specific enrichment in testes and its localisation to developing spermatocytes and at the acroblast of spermatids supports a role for GGA function in Drosophila spermatogenesis, even though spermatogenesis still occurs when GGA expression is depleted to <5% of control.",2011,"Jennifer Hirst, Jenny Carmichael, Jennifer Hirst, Jenny Carmichael"
"Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein, a pattern recognition receptor for lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan that mediates the signaling for the induction of innate immune genes in Drosophila melanogaster cells",10827089,10.1074/jbc.M003934200,"Pattern recognition receptors, non-clonal immune proteins recognizing common microbial components, are critical for non-self recognition and the subsequent induction of Rel/NF-kappaB-controlled innate immune genes. However, the molecular identities of such receptors are still obscure. Here, we present data showing that Drosophila possesses at least three cDNAs encoding members of the Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein (DGNBP) family, one of which, DGNBP-1, has been characterized. Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal laser microscopic analyses demonstrate that DGNBP-1 exists in both a soluble and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane form in culture medium supernatant and on Drosophila immunocompetent cells, respectively. DGNBP-1 has a high affinity to microbial immune elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-1,3-glucan whereas no binding affinity is detected with peptidoglycan, beta-1,4-glucan, or chitin. Importantly, the overexpression of DGNBP-1 in Drosophila immunocompetent cells enhances LPS- and beta-1,3-glucan-induced innate immune gene (NF-kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide gene) expression, which can be specifically blocked by pretreatment with anti-DGNBP-1 antibody. These results suggest that DGNBP-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and beta-1, 3-glucan from fungi and plays an important role in non-self recognition and the subsequent immune signal transmission for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes in the Drosophila innate immune system.",2000,"Y S Kim, J H Ryu, S J Han, K H Choi, K B Nam, I H Jang, B Lemaitre, P T Brey, W J Lee, Y S Kim, J H Ryu, S J Han, K H Choi, K B Nam, I H Jang, B Lemaitre, P T Brey, W J Lee"

Bub1 Facilitates Virus Entry through Endocytosis in a Model of Drosophila Pathogenesis,29976667,10.1128/JVI.00254-18,"In order to establish productive infection and dissemination, viruses usually evolve a number of strategies to hijack and/or subvert the host defense systems. However, host factors utilized by the virus to facilitate infection remain poorly characterized. In this work, we found that Drosophila melanogaster deficient in budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (bub1), a highly conserved subunit of the kinetochore complex regulating chromosome congression (1), became resistant to Drosophila C virus (DCV) infection, evidenced in increased survival rates and reduced viral loads, compared to the wild-type control. Mechanistic analysis further showed that Bub1 also functioned in the cytoplasm and was essentially involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis of DCV and other pathogens, thus limiting pathogen entry. DCV infection potentially had strengthened the interaction between Bub1 and the clathrin adaptor on the cell membrane. Furthermore, the conserved function of Bub1 was also verified in a mammalian cell line. Thus, our data demonstrated a previously unknown function of Bub1 that could be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate their infection and spread.IMPORTANCE In this work, we identify for the first time that the nuclear protein Bub1 (budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1), a highly conserved subunit of the kinetochore complex regulating chromosome congression, has a novel and important function on the cell membrane to facilitate the virus to enter host cells. Bub1 deficiency empowers the host to have the ability to resist viral infection in Drosophila and a human cell line. Bub1 is involved in the virus entry step through regulating endocytosis. The DCV capsid protein can recruit Bub1, and DCV infection can strengthen the interaction between Bub1 and a clathrin-dependent endocytosis component. The restricted entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Listeria monocytogenes in bub1-deficient flies and cell lines was also observed. Therefore, our data implicate a previously unknown function of Bub1 that can be hijacked by pathogens to facilitate their entry, and Bub1 may serve as a potential antiviral therapy target for limiting viral entry.",2018,"Shuo Yang, Junjing Yu, Zhiqin Fan, Si-Tang Gong, Hong Tang, Lei Pan, Shuo Yang, Junjing Yu, Zhiqin Fan, Si-Tang Gong, Hong Tang, Lei Pan"
Effect of genetic variation in a Drosophila model of diabetes-associated misfolded human proinsulin,24281155,10.1534/genetics.113.157800,"The identification and validation of gene-gene interactions is a major challenge in human studies. Here, we explore an approach for studying epistasis in humans using a Drosophila melanogaster model of neonatal diabetes mellitus. Expression of the mutant preproinsulin (hINS(C96Y)) in the eye imaginal disc mimics the human disease: it activates conserved stress-response pathways and leads to cell death (reduction in eye area). Dominant-acting variants in wild-derived inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel produce a continuous, highly heritable distribution of eye-degeneration phenotypes in a hINS(C96Y) background. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 154 sequenced lines identified a sharp peak on chromosome 3L, which mapped to a 400-bp linkage block within an intron of the gene sulfateless (sfl). RNAi knockdown of sfl enhanced the eye-degeneration phenotype in a mutant-hINS-dependent manner. RNAi against two additional genes in the heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthetic pathway (ttv and botv), in which sfl acts, also modified the eye phenotype in a hINS(C96Y)-dependent manner, strongly suggesting a novel link between HS-modified proteins and cellular responses to misfolded proteins. Finally, we evaluated allele-specific expression difference between the two major sfl-intronic haplotypes in heterozygtes. The results showed significant heterogeneity in marker-associated gene expression, thereby leaving the causal mutation(s) and its mechanism unidentified. In conclusion, the ability to create a model of human genetic disease, map a QTL by GWAS to a specific gene, and validate its contribution to disease with available genetic resources and the potential to experimentally link the variant to a molecular mechanism demonstrate the many advantages Drosophila holds in determining the genetic underpinnings of human disease.",2014,"Bin Z He, Michael Z Ludwig, Desiree A Dickerson, Levi Barse, Bharath Arun, Bjarni J Vilhjálmsson, Pengyao Jiang, Soo-Young Park, Natalia A Tamarina, Scott B Selleck, Patricia J Wittkopp, Graeme I Bell, Martin Kreitman, Bin Z He, Michael Z Ludwig, Desiree A Dickerson, Levi Barse, Bharath Arun, Bjarni J Vilhjálmsson, Pengyao Jiang, Soo-Young Park, Natalia A Tamarina, Scott B Selleck, Patricia J Wittkopp, Graeme I Bell, Martin Kreitman"
Nicotine increases lifespan and rescues olfactory and motor deficits in a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease,23871228,10.1016/j.bbr.2013.07.020,"Drosophila melanogaster is an attractive model of familial Parkinson's disease, as flies with loss-of-function mutations of the parkin gene exhibit many pathologies observed in PD patients. Progressive motor deficits found in homozygous parkin mutants seem to result from mitochondrial pathology that causes indirect flight muscle and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration [1,2]. We have found that heterozygous parkin mutants have decreased lifespan, generally progressive motor dysfunction and olfactory deficits compared to control flies, suggesting that mutation of this gene produces a dominant phenotype. Tobacco smokers are dose-dependently less likely to develop PD [3,4]; subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies show that nicotine is protective in models of sporadic PD [6]. Literature addressing the potential protection by nicotine in Parkin loss-of-function models spans limited concentrations and selected time points in the organism's lifespan. We have found that parkin heterozygotes have late-onset climbing and flying deficits as well as decreased viability and olfactory deficits that precede motor defects. While chronic nicotine exposure decreases lifespan and climbing and flying abilities in control flies, it can improve viability and flying capability as well as rescue climbing and olfactory deficits in parkin heterozygotes. Dopaminergic neurons are spared in the parkin heterozygote, perhaps because this phenotype is less severe than in the homozygous parkin mutants. Nicotine pretreatment may be protective in sporadic PD patients and models; however, timely diagnosis remains to be an obstacle.

"An integrated Drosophila model system reveals unique properties for F14512, a novel polyamine-containing anticancer drug that targets topoisomerase II",21853156,10.1371/journal.pone.0023597,"F14512 is a novel anti-tumor molecule based on an epipodophyllotoxin core coupled to a cancer-cell vectoring spermine moiety. This polyamine linkage is assumed to ensure the preferential uptake of F14512 by cancer cells, strong interaction with DNA and potent inhibition of topoisomerase II (Topo II). The antitumor activity of F14512 in human tumor models is significantly higher than that of other epipodophyllotoxins in spite of a lower induction of DNA breakage. Hence, the demonstrated superiority of F14512 over other Topo II poisons might not result solely from its preferential uptake by cancer cells, but could also be due to unique effects on Topo II interactions with DNA. To further dissect the mechanism of action of F14512, we used Drosophila melanogaster mutants whose genetic background leads to an easily scored phenotype that is sensitive to changes in Topo II activity and/or localization. F14512 has antiproliferative properties in Drosophila cells and stabilizes ternary Topo II/DNA cleavable complexes at unique sites located in moderately repeated sequences, suggesting that the drug specifically targets a select and limited subset of genomic sequences. Feeding F14512 to developing mutant Drosophila larvae led to the recovery of flies expressing a striking phenotype, ""Eye wide shut,"" where one eye is replaced by a first thoracic segment. Other recovered F14512-induced gain- and loss-of-function phenotypes similarly correspond to precise genetic dysfunctions. These complex in vivo results obtained in a whole developing organism can be reconciled with known genetic anomalies and constitute a remarkable instance of specific alterations of gene expression by ingestion of a drug.

A serial lectin approach to the mucin-type O-glycoproteome of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells,17708590,10.1002/pmic.200600793,"Identification of mucin-type O-glycosylated proteins with known functions in model organisms like Drosophila could provide keys to elucidate functions of the O-glycan moiety and proteomic analyses of O-glycoproteins in higher eukaryotes remain a challenge due to structural heterogeneity and a lack of efficient tools for their specific isolation. Here we report a strategy to evaluate the O-glycosylation potential of the embryonal hemocyte-like Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2) cell line by expression of recombinant glycosylation probes derived from tandem repeats of the human mucin MUC1 or of the Drosophila salivary gland protein Sgs1. We obtained evidence that mucin-type O-glycosylation in S2 cells grown under serum-free conditions is restricted to the Tn-antigen (GalNAcalpha-Ser/Thr) and the T-antigen (Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha-Ser/Thr) and this structural homogeneity enables unique glycoproteomic strategies. We present a label-free strategy for the isolation, profiling and analysis of O-glycosylated proteins consisting of serial lectin affinity capture, 2-DE-based glycoprotein analysis by O-glycan specific mAbs and protein identification by MALDI-MS. Protein identity and O-glycosylation was confirmed by ESI-MS/MS with detection of diagnostic sugar oxonium-ion fragments. Using this strategy, we established 2-D reference maps and identified 21 secreted and intracellular mucin-type O-glycoproteins. Our results show that Drosophila S2 cells express O-glycoproteins involved in a wide range of biological functions including proteins of the extracellular matrix (Laminin gamma-chain, Peroxidasin and Glutactin), pathogen recognition proteins (Gnbp1), stress response proteins (Glycoprotein 93), secreted proteases (Matrix-metalloprotease 1 and various trypsin-like serine proteases), protease inhibitors (Serpin 27 A) and proteins of unknown function.",2007,"Tilo Schwientek, Ulla Mandel, Udo Roth, Stefan Müller, Franz-Georg Hanisch, Tilo Schwientek, Ulla Mandel, Udo Roth, Stefan Müller, Franz-Georg Hanisch"
The SH2-like Akt homology (AH) domain of c-akt is present in multiple copies in the genome of vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes. Cloning and characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster c-akt homolog Dakt1,8302573,,"The Akt proto-oncogene encodes a serine-threonine protein kinase whose carboxyterminal catalytic domain is closely related to the catalytic domains of all the known members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. Akt, however, differs from PKC in its N-terminal region which contains a domain related distantly to the SH2 domain of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and other signalling proteins, which we have named Akt homology (AH) domain. Low stringency hybridization of a c-akt AH probe to a panel of genomic DNAs from vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes detected multiple DNA bands (perhaps multiple genes) in all tested species. Drosophila DNA contains at least three hybridizing DNA bands. One of them was cloned, and found by sequence analysis, to define an Akt related gene (Dakt1). Comparison between the coding regions of c-akt and Dakt1 revealed 64.6% identity at the nucleotide level and 76.5% similarity at the amino acid level. The highest degree of homology was detected in the AH domain (68.3% similarity at the amino acid level) and the catalytic domain (83.3% similarity). Additional sequence comparisons revealed that the amino acid similarity between the catalytic domains of Dkt1 and the three known members of the Drosophila protein kinase C (PKC) family, Dpkc1, Dpkc2 and Dpkc3, is 68%, 63.6% and 67.1%, respectively. Dakt1 was mapped to Drosophila chromosome 3R 89BC. Its expression is subject to developmental regulation with the highest levels detected within the fourth hour of embryonic development. These results confirm that the AH domain of Akt defines new protein families in both vertebrate and invertebrate eucaryotes. The high degree of homology between the catalytic domains of Dkt1 and the three known members of the Drosophila PKC family suggests an evolutionarily conserved functional relationship between the members of the two families.",1994,"T F Franke, K D Tartof, P N Tsichlis, T F Franke, K D Tartof, P N Tsichlis"
The Drosophila acetylcholine receptor subunit D alpha5 is part of an alpha-bungarotoxin binding acetylcholine receptor,15781463,10.1074/jbc.M409639200,"The central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster contains an alpha-bungarotoxin-binding protein with the properties expected of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This protein was purified 5800-fold from membranes prepared from Drosophila heads. The protein was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M sodium chloride and then purified using an alpha-cobratoxin column followed by a lentil lectin affinity column. The purified protein had a specific activity of 3.9 micromol of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites/g of protein. The subunit composition of the purified receptor was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This subunit profile was identical with that revealed by in situ labeling of the membrane-bound protein using the photolyzable methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate derivative of 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin. The purified receptor reveals two different protein bands with molecular masses of 42 and 57 kDa. From sedimentation analysis of the purified protein complex in H2O and D2O and gel filtration, a mass of 270 kDa was calculated. The receptor has a s(20,w) of 9.4 and a Stoke's radius of 7.4 nm. The frictional coefficient was calculated to be 1.7 indicating a highly asymmetric protein complex compatible with a transmembrane protein forming an ion channel. The sequence of a peptide obtained after tryptic digestion of the 42-kDa protein allowed the specific identification of the Drosophila D alpha5 subunit by sequence comparison.

      Members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily are proteins that are critical for insects to detect changes in environmental stimuli and also play key roles in their sensory physiology. Moreover, this family provides potential targets for the design of insecticides. In contrast to a large number of studies conducted on Drosophila melanogaster, molecular studies to characterize TRP channels in agricultural pests are lacking.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, we identified 15 TRP channel genes in the genome of a notorious agricultural pest, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). Comparative analysis of the TRP channels (TRPs) in B. dorsalis with those in D. melanogaster, Glossina morsitans, Musca domestica and the closely related Ceratitis capitata, and TRPs from mosquitoes, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera reveals that members of TRPA and TRPP subfamily are most diverse among insects. The results also suggest that Tephritidae family have two TRP-Polycystin 2 members even though most insects either possess just one or none. The highest expression levels of these two genes are in the testes of B. dorsalis, implying a role in regulating sperm function. We analyzed the expression profiles of the TRP channels identified in this study at different life stages using quantitative real time PCR. The results of this study demonstrate that all TRP channels are mainly expressed in adults, especially at mature stages. The one exception to this trend is BdTRPM, which is more highly expressed in the eggs of B. dorsalis, implying an important role in early development. We also detected the spatial expression of TRP channels in mature adult fruit flies by investigating expression levels within various tissues including those involved in sensory function, such as antennae, compound eyes, mouthparts, legs, and wings, as well as tissues critical for homeostasis and physiology (i.e., Malpighian tubules, the brain and gut as well as fat bodies, ovaries, and testes).

      Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are conserved ligand-gated ion channel receptors, and ionotropic receptors (IRs) were revealed as a new family of iGluRs. Their subdivision was unsettled, and their characteristics are little known. Anopheles sinensis is a major malaria vector in eastern Asia, and its genome was recently well sequenced and annotated.

      We identified iGluR genes in the An. sinensis genome, analyzed their characteristics including gene structure, genome distribution, domains and specific sites by bioinformatic methods, and deduced phylogenetic relationships of all iGluRs in An. sinensis, Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Based on the characteristics and phylogenetics, we generated the classification of iGluRs, and comparatively analyzed the intron number and selective pressure of three iGluRs subdivisions, iGluR group, Antenna IR and Divergent IR subfamily.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A total of 56 iGluR genes were identified and named in the whole-genome of An. sinensis. These genes were located on 18 scaffolds, and 31 of them (29 being IRs) are distributed into 10 clusters that are suggested to form mainly from recent gene duplication. These iGluRs can be divided into four groups: NMDA, non-NMDA, Antenna IR and Divergent IR based on feature comparison and phylogenetic analysis. IR8a and IR25a were suggested to be monophyletic, named as Putative in the study, and moved from the Antenna subfamily in the IR family to the non-NMDA group as a sister of traditional non-NMDA. The generated iGluRs of genes (including NMDA and regenerated non-NMDA) are relatively conserved, and have a more complicated gene structure, smaller ω values and some specific functional sites. The iGluR genes in An. sinensis, An. gambiae and D. melanogaster have amino-terminal domain (ATD), ligand binding domain (LBD) and Lig_Chan domains, except for IR8a that only has the LBD and Lig_Chan domains. However, the new concept IR family of genes (including regenerated Antenna IR, and Divergent IR), especially for Divergent IR are more variable, have a simpler gene structure (intron loss phenomenon) and larger ω values, and lack specific functional sites. These IR genes have no other domains except for Antenna IRs that only have the Lig_Chan domain.

Trimming of sequence reads alters RNA-Seq gene expression estimates,26911985,10.1186/s12859-016-0956-2,"Background:
      
    

    
      High-throughput RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the preferred technique for studying gene expression differences between biological samples and for discovering novel isoforms, though the techniques to analyze the resulting data are still immature. One pre-processing step that is widely but heterogeneously applied is trimming, in which low quality bases, identified by the probability that they are called incorrectly, are removed. However, the impact of trimming on subsequent alignment to a genome could influence downstream analyses including gene expression estimation; we hypothesized that this might occur in an inconsistent manner across different genes, resulting in differential bias.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To assess the effects of trimming on gene expression, we generated RNA-Seq data sets from four samples of larval Drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons, and used three trimming algorithms--SolexaQA, Trimmomatic, and ConDeTri-to perform quality-based trimming across a wide range of stringencies. After aligning the reads to the D. melanogaster genome with TopHat2, we used Cuffdiff2 to compare the original, untrimmed gene expression estimates to those following trimming. With the most aggressive trimming parameters, over ten percent of genes had significant changes in their estimated expression levels. This trend was seen with two additional RNA-Seq data sets and with alternative differential expression analysis pipelines. We found that the majority of the expression changes could be mitigated by imposing a minimum length filter following trimming, suggesting that the differential gene expression was primarily being driven by spurious mapping of short reads. Slight differences with the untrimmed data set remained after length filtering, which were associated with genes with low exon numbers and high GC content. Finally, an analysis of paired RNA-seq/microarray data sets suggests that no or modest trimming results in the most biologically accurate gene expression estimates.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We find that aggressive quality-based trimming has a large impact on the apparent makeup of RNA-Seq-based gene expression estimates, and that short reads can have a particularly strong impact. We conclude that implementation of trimming in RNA-Seq analysis workflows warrants caution, and if used, should be used in conjunction with a minimum read length filter to minimize the introduction of unpredictable changes in expression estimates.",2016,"Claire R Williams, Alyssa Baccarella, Jay Z Parrish, Charles C Kim, Claire R Williams, Alyssa Baccarella, Jay Z Parrish, Charles C Kim"
Mito-nuclear interactions as drivers of gene movement on and off the X-chromosome,24885291,10.1186/1471-2164-15-330,"Background:
      
    

    
      Mito-nuclear gene interactions regulate energy conversion, and are fundamental to eukaryotes. Generally, mito-nuclear coadaptation would be most efficient if the interacting nuclear genes were X-linked, because this maximizes the probability of favorable mito-nuclear allelic combinations co-transmitting across generations. Thus, under a coadaptation (CA) hypothesis, nuclear genes essential for mitochondrial function might be under selection to relocate to the X-chromosome. However, maternal inheritance predisposes the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to accumulate variation that, while male-harming, is benign to females. Numerous nuclear genes were recently reported in Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibit male-specific patterns of differential expression when placed alongside different mtDNA haplotypes, suggesting that nuclear genes are sensitive to an underlying male-specific mitochondrial mutation load. These genes are thus candidates for involvement in mito-nuclear interactions driven by sexual conflict (SC), and selection might have moved them off the X-chromosome to facilitate an optimal evolutionary counter-response, through males, to the presence of male-harming mtDNA mutations. Furthermore, the presence of male-harming mtDNA mutations could exert selection for modifiers on the Y-chromosome, thus placing these mito-sensitive nuclear genes at the center of an evolutionary tug-of-war between mitochondrion and Y-chromosome.We test these hypotheses by examining the chromosomal distributions of three distinct sets of mitochondrial-interacting nuclear genes in D. melanogaster; the first is a list of genes with mitochondrial annotations by Gene Ontologies, the second is a list comprising the core evolutionary-conserved mitochondrial proteome, and the third is a list of genes involved in male-specific responses to maternally-inherited mitochondrial variation and which might be putative targets of Y-chromosomal regulation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Genes with mitochondrial annotations and genes representing the mitochondrial proteome do not exhibit statistically-significant biases in chromosomal representation. However, genes exhibiting sex-specific sensitivity to mtDNA are under-represented on the X-chromosome, over-represented among genes known to be sensitive to Y-chromosomal variation, and among genes previously associated with male fitness, but under-represented among genes associated with direct sexual antagonism.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

They can be considered as reference animals (Urmetazoa) for the understanding of the evolutionary processes resulting in the creation of Metazoa in general and also for the metazoan gene organization in particular. In the marine sponge Suberites domuncula, genes encoding p38 and JNK kinases contain nine and twelve introns, respectively. Eight introns in both genes share the same positions and the identical phases. One p38 intron slipped for six bases and the JNK gene has three more introns. However, the sequences of the introns are not conserved and the introns in JNK gene are generally much longer. Introns interrupt most of the conserved kinase subdomains I-XI and are found in all three phases (0, 1 and 2). We analyzed in details p38 and JNK genes from human, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and found in most genes introns at the positions identical to those in sponge genes. The exceptions are two p38 genes from D. melanogaster that have lost all introns in the coding sequence. The positions of 11 introns in each of four human p38 genes are fully conserved and ten introns occupy identical positions as the introns in sponge p38 or JNK genes. The same is true for nine, out of ten introns in the human JNK-1 gene. The introns in human p38 and JNK genes are on average more than ten times longer than corresponding introns in sponges. It was proposed that yeast HOG1-like kinases (from i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Emericella nidulans) and metazoan p38 and JNK kinases are orthologues. p38 and JNK genes were created after the split from fungi by the duplication and diversification of the HOG1-like progenitor gene. Our results further support the common origin of p38 and JNK genes and speak in favor of a very early time of duplication. The ancestral gene contained at least ten introns, which are still present at the very conserved positions in p38 and JNK genes of extant animals. Four of these introns are present at the same positions in the HOG-like gene in the fungus E. nidulans. The others probably entered the ancestral gene after the split of fungi, but before the duplication of the gene and before the creation of the common, urmetazoan progenitor of all multicellular animals. A second gene coding for an immune molecule is described, the allograft inflammatory factor, which likewise showed a highly conserved exon/intron structure in S. domuncula and in human. These data show that the intron/exon borders are highly conserved in genes from sponges to human.",2002,"Werner E G Müller, Markus Böhm, Vladislav A Grebenjuk, Alexander Skorokhod, Isabel M Müller, Vera Gamulin, Werner E G Müller, Markus Böhm, Vladislav A Grebenjuk, Alexander Skorokhod, Isabel M Müller, Vera Gamulin"
"Very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases. Human ""bubblegum"" represents a new family of proteins capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids",10954726,10.1074/jbc.M006403200,"Activation by thioesterification to coenzyme A is a prerequisite for most reactions involving fatty acids. Enzymes catalyzing activation, acyl-CoA synthetases, have been classified by their chain length specificities. The most recently identified family is the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLCS). Although several members of this group are capable of activating very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), one is a bile acid-CoA synthetase, and others have been characterized as fatty acid transport proteins. It was reported that the Drosophila melanogaster mutant bubblegum (BGM) had elevated VLCFA and that the product of the defective gene had sequence homology to acyl-CoA synthetases. Therefore, we cloned full-length cDNA for a human homolog of BGM, and we investigated the properties of its protein product, hsBG, to determine whether it had VLCS activity. Northern blot analysis showed that hsBG is expressed primarily in brain. Compared with vector-transfected cells, COS-1 cells expressing hsBG had increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity with either long-chain fatty acid (2.4-fold) or VLCFA (2.6-fold) substrates. Despite this increased VLCFA activation, hsBG-expressing cells did not have increased rates of VLCFA degradation. Confocal microscopy showed that hsBG had a cytoplasmic localization in some COS-1 cells expressing the protein, whereas it appeared to associate with plasma membrane in others. Fractionation of these cells revealed that most of the hsBG-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase activity was soluble and not membrane-bound. Immunoaffinity-purified hsBG from transfected COS-1 cells was enzymatically active. hsBG and hsVLCS are only 15% identical, and comparison with sequences of two conserved motifs from all known families of acyl-CoA synthetases revealed that hsBG along with the D. melanogaster and murine homologs comprise a new family of acyl-CoA synthetases. Thus, two protein families are now known that contain enzymes capable of activating VLCFA. Because hsBG is expressed in brain but previously described VLCSs were not highly expressed in this organ, hsBG may play a central role in brain VLCFA metabolism and myelinogenesis.",2000,"S J Steinberg, J Morgenthaler, A K Heinzer, K D Smith, P A Watkins, S J Steinberg, J Morgenthaler, A K Heinzer, K D Smith, P A Watkins"

Rapid and high resolution detection of in situ hybridisation to polytene chromosomes using fluorochrome-labeled RNA,6170491,10.1007/BF00293359,"Fluorochrome-labeled RNA allows the rapid detection of in situ hybrids without the need for long exposure times as in the autoradiographical hybridisation methods. Resolution is high because of the high resolving power of fluorescence microscopy. The application of a previously reported method for the hybrido-cytochemical detection of DNA sequences to polytene chromosomes of Drosophilia is described. The specificity and sensitivity of the method are demonstrated by the hybridisation with polytene chromosomes of 1) rhodamine-labeled 5S RNA, to the 5S rRNA sites of D. melanogaster (56F) and D. hydei (23B), 2) rhodamine-labeled RNA complementary to a plasmid containing histone genes, to the 39DE region of D. melanogaster, 3) rhodamine-labeled D. melanogaster tRNA species (Gly-3 and Arg-2), to their respective loci in D. melanogaster, 4) rhodamine-labeled RNA complementary to the insert of plasmid 232.1 containing part of a D. melanogaster heat shock gene from locus 87C, to D. hydei heat shock locus 2-32A. In the latter instance it was possible to demonstrate the labeling of a double band which escaped unambiguous detection by autoradiography in the radioactive cytochemical hybridisation procedure because of the low topological resolution of autoradiograms. The sensitivity of the fluorochrome-labeled RNA method is compared with the radioactive methods which use 3H- or 125 I-labeled RNAs.

Expression of calpain-like proteins and effects of calpain inhibitors on the growth rate of Angomonas deanei wild type and aposymbiotic strains,26415499,10.1186/s12866-015-0519-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      Angomonas deanei is a trypanosomatid parasite of insects that has a bacterial endosymbiont, which supplies amino acids and other nutrients to its host. Bacterium loss induced by antibiotic treatment of the protozoan leads to an aposymbiotic strain with increased need for amino acids and results in increased production of extracellular peptidases. In this work, a more detailed examination of A. deanei was conducted to determine the effects of endosymbiont loss on the host calpain-like proteins (CALPs), followed by testing of different calpain inhibitors on parasite proliferation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Western blotting showed the presence of different protein bands reactive to antibodies against calpain from Drosophila melanogaster (anti-Dm-calpain), lobster calpain (anti-CDPIIb) and cytoskeleton-associated calpain from Trypanosoma brucei (anti-CAP5.5), suggesting a possible modulation of CALPs influenced by the endosymbiont. In the cell-free culture supernatant of A. deanei wild type and aposymbiotic strains, a protein of 80 kDa cross-reacted with the anti-Dm-calpain antibody; however, no cross-reactivity was found with anti-CAP5.5 and anti-CDPIIb antibodies. A search in A. deanei genome for homologues of D. melanogaster calpain, T. brucei CAP5.5 and lobster CDPIIb calpain revealed the presence of hits with at least one calpain conserved domain and also with theoretical molecular mass consistent with the recognition by each antibody. No significant hit was observed in the endosymbiont genome, indicating that calpain molecules might be absent from the symbiont. Flow cytometry analysis of cells treated with the anti-calpain antibodies showed that a larger amount of reactive epitopes was located intracellularly. The reversible calpain inhibitor MDL28170 displayed a much higher efficacy in diminishing the growth of both strains compared to the non-competitive calpain inhibitor PD150606, while the irreversible calpain inhibitor V only marginally diminished the proliferation.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Altogether, these results indicate that distinct calpain-like molecules are expressed by A. deanei, with a possible modulation in the expression influenced by the endosymbiont. In addition, treatment with MDL28170 affects the growth rate of both strains, as previously determined in the human pathogenic species Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi, with whom A. deanei shares immunological and biochemical relationships.",2015,"Simone Santiago Carvalho de Oliveira, Aline dos Santos Garcia-Gomes, Claudia Masini d'Avila-Levy, André Luis Souza dos Santos, Marta Helena Branquinha, Simone Santiago Carvalho de Oliveira, Aline dos Santos Garcia-Gomes, Claudia Masini d'Avila-Levy, André Luis Souza dos Santos, Marta Helena Branquinha"
"Comparison of the activity of non-steroidal ecdysone agonists between dipteran and lepidopteran insects, using cell-based EcR reporter assays",20672340,10.1002/ps.1998,"Background:
      
    

    
      Diacylhydrazine (DAH) analogues have been developed successfully as a new group of insect growth regulators, called ecdysone agonists or moulting accelerating compounds. These DAHs have been shown to manifest their toxicity via interaction with the ecdysone receptor (EcR) in susceptible insects, as does the natural insect moulting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). A notable feature is their high activity and specificity, particularly against lepidopteran insects, raising the question as to whether non-lepidopteran-specific analogues can be isolated. However, for the discovery of ecdysone agonists that target other important insect groups such as Diptera, efficient screening systems that are based on the activation of the EcR are needed.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, a dipteran-specific reporter-based screening system with transfected S2 cells of Drosophila melanogaster Meig. was developed in order to discover and evaluate compounds that have ecdysone agonistic or antagonistic activity. A library of non-steroidal ecdysone agonists containing different mother structures with DAH and other related analogues such as acylaminoketone (AAK) and tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) was tested. None of the compounds tested was as active as 20E. This is in contrast to the very high activity of several DAH and AAK congeners in lepidopteran cells (Bombyx mori L.-derived Bm5 cells). The latter agrees with a successful docking of a DAH, tebufenozide, in the binding pocket of the lepidopteran EcR (B. mori), while this was not the case with the dipteran EcR (D. melanogaster). Of note was the identification of two THQ compounds with activity in S2 but not in Bm5 cells. Although marked differences in activity exist with respect to the activation of EcR between dipterans and lepidopterans, there exists a positive correlation (R = 0.724) between the pLC(50) values in S2 and Bm5 cells. In addition, it was found through protein modelling that a second lobe was present in the ligand-binding pocket of lepidopteran BmEcR but was lacking in the dipteran DmEcR protein, suggesting that this difference in structure of the binding pocket is a major factor for preferential activation of the lepidopteran over the dipteran receptors by DAH ligands.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The present study confirmed the marked specificity of DAH and AAK analogues towards EcRs from lepidopteran insects. THQ compounds did not show this specificity, indicating that dipteran-specific ecdysone-agonist-based insecticides based on the THQ mother structure can be developed.

RNA interference in ageing research--a mini-review,20090308,10.1159/000277626,"Background:
      
    

    
      The search for genetic mechanisms affecting life-span and ageing represents an important part of ageing research, especially since the discovery of single-gene mutations with dramatic effects on these traits. Due to its relative ease of use and its power to specifically target arbitrary genes, RNA interference (RNAi) has rapidly been adopted as a technique for silencing gene expression. The feasibility of genome-wide RNAi screens potentially much simplifies the identification of novel ageing-related genes.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
      In a review of applications of RNAi in ageing research with a focus on the model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and discussing recent technical developments, we aim to highlight the current and future impact of this technology in the field.
    

    
  


        Method:
      
    

    
      We show how RNAi has successfully been used to complement classic mutant studies. Moreover, we discuss the novel opportunities and challenges of an application of RNAi in genome-wide screens in D. melanogaster, which has become possible with the recent availability of a comprehensive transgenic RNAi library for the fly. We highlight, in particular, how the flexible control of RNAi induction can support the study of dynamic processes like ageing through specific experiments and the development of matching computational methods. In an overview of complementary approaches we discuss the challenge of extracting insight from the high-dimensional measurement datasets that are required for the study of dynamic effects and interaction dependencies.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool for the study of ageing, allowing the further characterization of the roles of specific genes in the ageing process as well as the efficient identification of new genes implicated. RNAi has contributed to our understanding of age-related diseases especially by making genes amenable to manipulation for which mutants were not easily available. Recent developments enable genome-wide screens with unprecedented temporal and spatial control of RNAi induction. Specific RNAi time-course experiments provide an opportunity for the analysis of high-resolution gene expression profiles capturing the dynamics of ageing-relevant processes and gene interactions. Research exploiting new avenues opened by the growing RNAi toolbox will considerably contribute to the next steps in researching the genetics of ageing and age-related diseases.",2010,"Nadège Minois, Peter Sykacek, Brian Godsey, David P Kreil, Nadège Minois, Peter Sykacek, Brian Godsey, David P Kreil"
Saccharomyces cerevisiae YCRO17c/CWH43 encodes a putative sensor/transporter protein upstream of the BCK2 branch of the PKC1-dependent cell wall integrity pathway,11427965,10.1002/yea.731,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae cwh43-2 mutant, originally isolated for its Calcofluor white hypersensitivity, displays several cell wall defects similar to mutants in the PKC1-MPK1 pathway, including a growth defect and increased release of beta-1,6-glucan and beta-glucosylated proteins into the growth medium at increased temperatures. The cloning of CWH43 showed that it corresponds to YCR017c and encodes a protein with 14-16 transmembrane segments containing several putative phosphorylation and glycosylation sites. The N-terminal part of the amino acid sequence of Cwh43p shows 40% similarity with the mammalian FRAG1, a membrane protein that activates the fibroblast growth factor receptor of rat osteosarcoma (FGFR2-ROS) and with protein sequences of four uncharacterized ORFs from Caenorhabditis elegans and one from Drosophila melanogaster. The C-terminus of Cwh43p shows low similarities with a xylose permease of Bacillus megaterium and with putative sugar transporter from D. melanogaster, and has 52% similarity with a protein sequence from a Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNA. A Cwh43-GFP fusion protein suggested a plasma membrane localization, although localization to the internal structure of the cells could not be excluded, and it concentrates to the bud tip of small budded cells and to the neck of dividing cells. Deletion of CWH43 resulted in cell wall defects less pronounced than those of the cwh43-2 mutant. This allele-specific phenotype appears to be due to a G-R substitution at position 57 in a highly conserved region of the protein. Genetic analysis places CWH43 upstream of the BCK2 branch of the PKC1 signalling pathway, since cwh43 mutations were synthetic lethal with pkc1 deletion, whereas the cwh43 defects could be rescued by overexpression of BCK2 and not by high-copy-number expression of genes encoding downstream proteins of the PKC1 pathway However, unlike BCK2, whose disruption in a cln3 mutant resulted in growth arrest in G(1), no growth defect was observed in a double cwh43 cln3 mutants. Taken together, it is proposed that CWH43 encodes a protein with putative sensor and transporter domains acting in parallel to the main PKC1-dependent cell wall integrity pathway, and that this gene has evolved into two distinct genes in higher eukaryotes.",2001,"H Martin-Yken, A Dagkessamanskaia, P De Groot, A Ram, F Klis, J François, H Martin-Yken, A Dagkessamanskaia, P De Groot, A Ram, F Klis, J François"

The binding to cytochrome oxidase results in a positive increase in the ellipticities of the positive and negative Cotton effects at 404 nm and 417 nm of cytochrome c. The horse, human, and rat cytochromes c display less of an increase in the ellipticity of the positive Cotton effect at 404 nm, but more of a positive change in the negative Cotton effect at 417 nm than the C. krusei or D. melanogaster proteins. Interaction with yeast cytochrome c peroxidase elicits only a positive change in the ellipticity of the positive Cotton effect at 404 nm. No significant change is observed in the negative Cotton effect at 417 nm. Rat cytochrome c variants with a phenylalanine in place of tyrosine-67 and/or an alanine in place of proline-30 all display circular dichroism spectral changes upon binding to cytochrome c oxidase or cytochrome c peroxidase identical to those of the unaltered protein. The increase in ellipticity at 404 nm upon binding occurs even though replacement of tyrosine-67 results in the loss of the positive Cotton effect at this position. Polyglutamate and phosvitin complexes of cytochrome c show changes in the circular dichroism spectrum similar to those observed with cytochrome c peroxidase. However, the magnitudes of the spectral changes were considerably less. A model is proposed in which the main cause of the circular dichroism spectral changes observed upon complexation arise from the exclusion of solvent from the exposed front heme edge. According to this model, the exclusion of solvent changes the relative asymmetry of the environment of the electronic transitions of the heme prosthetic group of cytochrome c, resulting in observed circular dichroic effects.",1994,"E A Garber, E Margoliash, E A Garber, E Margoliash"

A cDNA clone of 674 bp with a single open reading frame was isolated for a 25,000 molecular weight polypeptide member of this family, alpha CP25, and a single transcript of approximately 700 bp was found in the ovary of vitellogenic females. Both the DNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence showed considerable homology with the embryonic lethal gene, l(2)efl, in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition to the sequence for l(2)efl, the predicted amino acid sequence for acp25 also showed significant sequence similarly with the alpha-crystallin A chain polypeptides from the lenses of vertebrae eyes. An N-terminal hydrophobic aggregation site and a C-terminal protective binding site common to alpha-crystallin proteins were present in the predicted acp25 and l(2)efl amino acid sequences, while only the C-terminal protective binding site was present in the small heat shock protein sequences from D. melanogaster. This evidence suggests that although the alpha-crystallin protein cognates in P. interpunctella evolved from a gene common with small heat shock protein genes, the amino acid sequence has converged on a structure similar to that of alpha-crystallin proteins. Native immunoblot analysis showed that the alpha-crystallin proteins formed high molecular weight complexes with the follicular epithelium yolk protein (FEYP) but not vitellin in yolk. An electroblot binding assay was used to show that the germ-cell alpha-crystallins of P. interpunctella bind specifically with the FEYP and that the binding was reversible in the presence of ATP or low pH. This evidence in conjunction with the evidence that the alpha-crystallins and FEYP form a stable complex that co-purifies from native egg proteins suggests that the alpha-cystallin cognates function as chaperones for the follicular epithelium yolk proteins in the embryos of P. interpunctella.",1998,"P D Shirk, R Broza, M Hemphill, O P Perera, P D Shirk, R Broza, M Hemphill, O P Perera"
Two novel LEM-domain proteins are splice products of the annotated Drosophila melanogaster gene CG9424 (Bocksbeutel),15035436,10.1078/0171-9335-00350,"The LEM motif is a sequence of 40-50 amino acids that has been identified in a number of non-related proteins of the inner nuclear membrane including the lamina-associated polypeptides 2 (LAP2), emerin, MAN1 and the Drosophila protein otefin. This evolutionary conserved sequence motif can mediate via the interaction with the small protein BAF the binding of LEM-domain proteins to DNA. Taking advantage of its sequenced genome we analyzed whether Drosophila possesses beside otefin additional genes coding for proteins with a LEM motif. A putative candidate gene was the annotated gene CG9424 which we named Bocksbeutel. Of all putative Drosophila LEM-domain proteins, otefin and Bocksbeutel exhibited the highest similarity in the LEM motif (53% identical amino acids). The Bocksbeutel gene can code for two isoforms of 399 and 351 amino acids that are produced by alternative splicing. In the alpha-isoform a transmembrane domain is localized close to the carboxyterminus. This segment is absent in the shorter beta-isoform. By RT-PCR we could show that in the embryo the mRNA coding for the alpha-isoform and in significantly lower amounts the mRNA coding for the beta-isoform are expressed. When expressed in transfected cells as GFP fusion proteins, the beta-isoform is localized predominantly in the nucleoplasm and the alpha-isoform is targeted to the nuclear envelope, indicating that Bocksbeutel-alpha is localized in the inner nuclear membrane. Bocksbeutel-alpha is the predominant isoform expressed in cells, larvae, and flies. Indirect immunofluorescence with Bocksbeutel-specific antibodies on tissues and cultured cells revealed that Bocksbeutel proteins are localized in the nuclear envelope and in the cytoplasm. By RNA interference we have down-regulated the expression of Bocksbeutel, BAF, otefin, and lamin DmO in Drosophila Kc167 cells. The down-regulation of Bocksbeutel and otefin had no influence on the viability of Kc167 cells and the intracellular localization of all other nuclear and nuclear envelope proteins analyzed. In contrast, when lamin DmO was reduced by RNAi the distribution of Bocksbeutel and otefin in the nuclear envelope of Kc167 cells was significantly altered. We conclude that the two LEM-domain proteins Bocksbeutel and otefin are no limiting components for the maintenance of the nuclear architecture in cultured Drosophila cells at interphase.",2004,"Nicole Wagner, Johannes Schmitt, Georg Krohne, Nicole Wagner, Johannes Schmitt, Georg Krohne"

Here we describe a second Drosophila protein (dOgg1) with 8-OH-Gua and abasic (AP) site DNA repair activities. The Drosophila OGG1 gene codes for a protein of 327 amino acids, which shows 33 and 37% identity with the yeast and human Ogg1 proteins, respectively. The DNA glycosylase activity of purified dOgg1 was investigated using gamma-irradiated DNA and gas chromatography/isotope dilution mass spectrometry (GC/IDMS). The dOgg1 protein excises 8-OH-Gua and 2, 6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) from gamma-irradiated DNA. with k(ca)(t)/K:(M) values of 21.0 x 10(-5) and 11.2 x 10(-5) (min(-1) nM(-1)), respectively. Enzymatic assays using oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing a single lesion show that dOgg1 displays a marked preference for DNA duplexes containing 8-OH-Gua, 8-OH-Ade or an AP site placed opposite a cytosine. The cleavage of the 8-OH-Gua-containing strand results from the excision of the damaged base followed by a ss-elimination reaction at the 3'-side of the resulting AP site. Cleavage of 8-OH-Gua.C duplex involves the formation of a reaction intermediate that is converted into a stable covalent adduct in the presence of sodium borohydre. dOgg1 complements the mutator phenotype of fpg mutY mutants of Escherichia coli. Whole-mount in situ hybridizations on tissues at different stages of Drosophila development reveal that the dOGG1 messenger is expressed uniformly at a low level in cells in which mitotic division occurs. Therefore, Drosophila possesses two DNA glycosylase activities that can excise 8-OH-Gua and formamidopyrimidines from DNA, dOgg1 and the ribosomal protein S3.",2000,"C Dherin, M Dizdaroglu, H Doerflinger, S Boiteux, J P Radicella, C Dherin, M Dizdaroglu, H Doerflinger, S Boiteux, J P Radicella"
The Drosophila G protein gamma subunit gene (D-G gamma 1) produces three developmentally regulated transcripts and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system,1372898,,"A genomic clone, 536, located at the 44CD region of polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster, has been characterized for its neurobiological importance. We found that this clone contains a gene which produces 2.6-, 1.3- and 1.1-kilobase (kb) RNAs. While the 2.6-kb RNA is expressed only in the head, the 1.3-kb RNA is present exclusively in the body. The 1.1-kb RNA, however, is found in both the head and body, but in much higher concentration in the head. DNA sequence analysis of a 2.6-kb RNA-specific cDNA showed that this gene encodes a 70-amino acid polypeptide which is the putative Drosophila homologue to the gamma subunit of the bovine G-protein. The Drosophila protein, named D-G gamma 1, shares 46, 43, and 28% identity, and 59, 52, and 60% similarity, with the gamma 2, gamma 3, and gamma t proteins of bovine G proteins, respectively. Sequencing of the 1.1-kb RNA-specific cDNA clone revealed that the 1.1-kb RNA is produced from the 2.6-kb transcription unit by usage of an alternative polyadenylation site, and has a coding region identical to that of the 2.6-kb RNA. Genomic Southern blot hybridization indicated that the Drosophila genome has only one D-G gamma 1 gene. Throughout development the 1.1-kb RNA is found to be the most prevalent species; its level peaks between 9 and 12 h of embryogenesis.

"Sex-specific splicing in Drosophila: widespread occurrence, tissue specificity and evolutionary conservation",19015538,10.1534/genetics.108.096743,"Many genes in eukaryotic genomes produce multiple transcripts through a variety of molecular mechanisms including alternative splicing. Alternatively spliced transcripts often encode functionally distinct proteins, indicating that gene regulation at this level makes an important contribution to organismal complexity. The multilevel splicing cascade that regulates sex determination and sex-specific development in Drosophila is a classical example of the role of alternative splicing in cell differentiation. Recent evidence suggests that a large proportion of genes in the Drosophila genome may be spliced in a sex-biased fashion, raising the possibility that alternative splicing may play a more general role in sexually dimorphic development and physiology. However, the prevalence of sex-specific splicing and the extent to which it is shared among genotypes are not fully understood. Genetic variation in the splicing of key components of the sex determination pathway is known to influence the expression of downstream target genes, suggesting that alternative splicing at other loci may also vary in functionally important ways. In this study, we used exon-specific microarrays to examine 417 multitranscript genes for evidence of sex-specific and genotype-specific splicing in 80 different genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. Most of these loci showed sex-biased splicing, whereas genotype-specific splicing was rare. One hundred thirty-five genes showed different alternative transcript use in males vs. females. Real-time PCR analysis of 6 genes chosen to represent a broad range of biological functions showed that most sex-biased splicing occurs in the gonads. However, somatic tissues, particularly adult heads, also show evidence of sex-specific splicing. Comparison of splicing patterns at orthologous loci in seven Drosophila species shows that sexual biases in alternative exon representation are highly conserved, indicating that sex-specific splicing is an ancient feature of Drosophila biology. To investigate potential mechanisms of sex-biased splicing, we used real-time PCR to examine the expression of six known regulators of alternative splicing in males vs. females. We found that all six loci are themselves spliced sex specifically in gonads and heads, suggesting that regulatory hierarchies based on alternative splicing may be an important feature of sexual differentiation.",2009,"Marina Telonis-Scott, Artyom Kopp, Marta L Wayne, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Lauren M McIntyre, Marina Telonis-Scott, Artyom Kopp, Marta L Wayne, Sergey V Nuzhdin, Lauren M McIntyre"
"Comparative analysis of FKBP family protein: evaluation, structure, and function in mammals and Drosophila melanogaster",29587629,10.1186/s12861-018-0167-3,"Background:
      
    

    
      FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) have become the subject of considerable interest in several fields, leading to the identification of several cellular and molecular pathways in which FKBPs impact prenatal development and pathogenesis of many human diseases.
    

    
  


        Main body:
      
    

    
      This analysis revealed differences between how mammalian and Drosophila FKBPs mechanisms function in relation to the immunosuppressant drugs, FK506 and rapamycin. Differences that could be used to design insect-specific pesticides. (1) Molecular phylogenetic analysis of FKBP family proteins revealed that the eight known Drosophila FKBPs share homology with the human FKBP12. This indicates a close evolutionary relationship, and possible origination from a common ancestor. (2) The known FKBPs contain FK domains, that is, a prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain that mediates immune suppression through inhibition of calcineurin. The dFKBP59, CG4735/Shutdown, CG1847, and CG5482 have a Tetratricopeptide receptor domain at the C-terminus, which regulates transcription and protein transportation. (3) FKBP51 and FKBP52 (dFKBP59), along with Cyclophilin 40 and protein phosphatase 5, function as Hsp90 immunophilin co-chaperones within steroid receptor-Hsp90 heterocomplexes. These immunophilins are potential drug targets in pathways associated with normal physiology and may be used to treat a variety of steroid-based diseases by targeting exocytic/endocytic cycling and vesicular trafficking. (4) By associating with presinilin, a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, FKBP14 is a downstream effector of Notch activation at the membrane. Meanwhile, Shutdown associates with transposons in the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway, playing a crucial role in both germ cells and ovarian somas. Mutations in or silencing of dFKBPs lead to early embryonic lethality in Drosophila. Therefore, further understanding the mechanisms of FK506 and rapamycin binding to immunophilin FKBPs in endocrine, cardiovascular, and neurological function in both mammals and Drosophila would provide prospects in generating unique, insect specific therapeutics targeting the above cellular signaling pathways.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

FMAj: a tool for high content analysis of muscle dynamics in Drosophila metamorphosis,25521203,10.1186/1471-2105-15-S16-S6,"Background:
      
    

    
      During metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster, larval muscles undergo two different developmental fates; one population is removed by cell death, while the other persistent subset undergoes morphological remodeling and survives to adulthood. Thanks to the ability to perform live imaging of muscle development in transparent pupae and the power of genetics, metamorphosis in Drosophila can be used as a model to study the regulation of skeletal muscle mass. However, time-lapse microscopy generates sizeable image data that require new tools for high throughput image analysis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We performed targeted gene perturbation in muscles and acquired 3D time-series images of muscles in metamorphosis using laser scanning confocal microscopy. To quantify the phenotypic effects of gene perturbations, we designed the Fly Muscle Analysis tool (FMAj) which is based on the ImageJ and MySQL frameworks for image processing and data storage, respectively. The image analysis pipeline of FMAj contains three modules. The first module assists in adding annotations to time-lapse datasets, such as genotypes, experimental parameters and temporal reference points, which are used to compare different datasets. The second module performs segmentation and feature extraction of muscle cells and nuclei. Users can provide annotations to the detected objects, such as muscle identities and anatomical information. The third module performs comparative quantitative analysis of muscle phenotypes. We applied our tool to the phenotypic characterization of two atrophy related genes that were silenced by RNA interference. Reduction of Drosophila Tor (Target of Rapamycin) expression resulted in enhanced atrophy compared to control, while inhibition of the autophagy factor Atg9 caused suppression of atrophy and enlarged muscle fibers of abnormal morphology. FMAj enabled us to monitor the progression of atrophic and hypertrophic phenotypes of individual muscles throughout metamorphosis.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We designed a new tool to visualize and quantify morphological changes of muscles in time-lapse images of Drosophila metamorphosis. Our in vivo imaging experiments revealed that evolutionarily conserved genes involved in Tor signalling and autophagy, perform similar functions in regulating muscle mass in mammals and Drosophila. Extending our approach to a genome-wide scale has the potential to identify new genes involved in muscle size regulation.",2014,"Yadav Kuleesha, Wee Choo Puah, Feng Lin, Martin Wasser, Yadav Kuleesha, Wee Choo Puah, Feng Lin, Martin Wasser"
"The evolving role of the orphan nuclear receptor ftz-f1, a pair-rule segmentation gene",24261442,10.1111/ede.12050,"Segmentation is a critical developmental process that occurs by different mechanisms in diverse taxa. In insects, there are three common modes of embryogenesis-short-, intermediate-, and long-germ development-which differ in the number of segments specified at the blastoderm stage. While genes involved in segmentation have been extensively studied in the long-germ insect Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), it has been found that their expression and function in segmentation in short- and intermediate-germ insects often differ. Drosophila ftz-f1 encodes an orphan nuclear receptor that functions as a maternally expressed pair-rule segmentation gene, responsible for the formation of alternate body segments during Drosophila embryogenesis. Here we investigated the expression and function of ftz-f1 in the short-germ beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Tc). We found that Tc-ftz-f1 is expressed in stripes in Tribolium embryos. These stripes overlap alternate Tc-Engrailed (Tc-En) stripes, indicative of a pair-rule expression pattern. To test whether Tc-ftz-f1 has pair-rule function, we utilized embryonic RNAi, injecting double-stranded RNA corresponding to Tc-ftz-f1 coding or non-coding regions into early Tribolium embryos. Knockdown of Tc-ftz-f1 produced pair-rule segmentation defects, evidenced by loss of expression of alternate En stripes. In addition, a later role for Tc-ftz-f1 in cuticle formation was revealed. These results identify a new pair-rule gene in Tribolium and suggest that its role in segmentation may be shared among holometabolous insects. Interestingly, while Tc-ftz-f1 is expressed in pair-rule stripes, the gene is ubiquitously expressed in Drosophila embryos. Thus, the pair-rule function of ftz-f1 is conserved despite differences in expression patterns of ftz-f1 genes in different lineages. This suggests that ftz-f1 expression changed after the divergence of lineages leading to extant beetles and flies, likely due to differences in cis-regulatory sequences. We propose that the dependence of Dm-Ftz-F1 on interaction with the homeodomain protein Ftz which is expressed in stripes in Drosophila, loosened constraints on Dm-ftz-f1 expression, allowing for ubiquitous expression of this pair-rule gene in Drosophila.",2013,"Alison Heffer, Nathaniel Grubbs, James Mahaffey, Leslie Pick, Alison Heffer, Nathaniel Grubbs, James Mahaffey, Leslie Pick"
Positive selection at a seminal fluid gene within a QTL for conspecific sperm precedence,25417008,10.1007/s10709-014-9800-7,"The role of sexual selection in driving the rapid evolution of male reproductive proteins has been tested in a wide variety of organisms. Sperm competition is a form of postmating sexual selection that can contribute to reproductive isolation between species by biasing the proportion of progeny fathered by conspecific over heterospecific males. This phenomenon is known as conspecific sperm precedence (CSP). A previous quantitative trait loci study between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia identified a locus associated with CSP within the second chromosome centered at the 53 cytogenetic map position. Male accessory gland proteins (ACPs) are associated with triggering postmating physiological responses in D. melanogaster females that can contribute to differential male reproductive success. Moreover, a large number of ACPs evolve rapidly and under positive selection among closely-related species of Drosophila. Here we have sequenced five candidate Acp genes (Acp53C14a, Acp53C14b, Acp53C14c, Acp53Ea and Acp54A1) within the previously mapped D. simulans-D. sechellia CSP locus from different D. simulans and D. sechellia strains. Polymorphism data analysis shows evidence of a selective sweep at Acp53Ea within D. simulans. In the context of CSP, the combined use of polymorphism and interspecies sequence divergence shows that Acp53C14c gene tree topology separates D. simulans and D. sechellia. Moreover, Acp53C14c is the only gene showing evidence of positive selection with five fixed amino acid substitutions between species. Our results highlight Acp53C14c as a candidate gene for future gene targeting studies to elucidate its role in CSP between D. simulans and D. sechellia.",2014,"Alberto Civetta, Angela Reimer, Alberto Civetta, Angela Reimer"
A highly conserved sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of the drosophila Adh gene plays a functional role in Adh expression,9927459,,"Phylogenetic analysis identified a highly conserved eight-base sequence (AAGGCTGA) within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene, Adh. To examine the functional significance of this conserved motif, we performed in vitro deletion mutagenesis on the D. melanogaster Adh gene followed by P-element-mediated germline transformation. Deletion of all or part of the eight-base sequence leads to a twofold increase in in vivo ADH enzymatic activity. The increase in activity is temporally and spatially general and is the result of an underlying increase in Adh transcript. These results indicate that the conserved 3'-UTR motif plays a functional role in the negative regulation of Adh gene expression. The evolutionary significance of our results may be understood in the context of the amino acid change that produces the ADH-F allele and also leads to a twofold increase in ADH activity. While there is compelling evidence that the amino acid replacement has been a target of positive selection, the conservation of the 3'-UTR sequence suggests that it is under strong purifying selection. The selective difference between these two sequence changes, which have similar effects on ADH activity, may be explained by different metabolic costs associated with the increase in activity.",1999,"J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda, J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda"
An eye imaginal disc-specific transcriptional enhancer in the long terminal repeat of the tom retrotransposon is responsible for eye morphology mutations of Drosophila ananassae,8668126,10.1007/BF02172914,"Optic morphology (Om) mutations of Drosophila ananassae are semidominant, neomorphic and nonpleiotropic, map to at least 22 loci scattered throughout the genome, and are associated with the insertion of the tom retrotransposon. Molecular and genetic analyses have revealed that eye morphology defects of Om mutants are caused by the ectopic or excessive expression of Om genes in the eye imaginal discs of third instar larvae. It is therefore assumed that the tom element carries tissue-specific gene regulatory sequences which enhance expression of the Om genes. In the present study, we examined whether or not the long terminal repeats (LTR) of the tom element contain such an eye imaginal disc-specific enhancer, using D. melanogaster transformants containing a lacZ gene ligated to the tom LTR. Analyses of lacZ gene expression in the eye imaginal discs of third instar larvae of 18 independently established transformant lines showed that the tom LTR was capable of enhancing lacZ expression in all the transformant lines, but the degree of enhancement varied between lines. In addition, the effect of the tom LTR lacZ gene evidently changed when the tom LTR construct was relocated to different chromosomal positions. On the basis of these findings, it is hypothesized that ectopic and excessive expression of the Om genes in the eye imaginal discs is induced by an eye imaginal disc-specific enhancer present in the tom LTR, the effect of which may be subject to chromosomal position effects.",1996,"T Awasaki, N Juni, K M Yoshida, T Awasaki, N Juni, K M Yoshida"
Correlated evolution of the cis-acting regulatory elements and developmental expression of the Drosophila Gld gene in seven species from the subgroup melanogaster,8187349,10.1002/dvg.1020150106,"The tissue-specific expression patterns of glucose dehydrogenase (GLD) exhibit a high degree of interspecific variation in the adult reproductive tract among the species in the genus Drosophila. We chose to focus on the evolution of GLD expression and the evolution of the Gld promoter in seven closely related species in the melanogaster subgroup as a means of elucidating the relationship of changes in cis-acting regulatory elements in the Gld promoter region with changes in tissue-specific expression. Although little variation in tissue-specific patterns of GLD was found in nonreproductive tissues during development, a surprisingly high level of variation was observed in the expression of GLD in both developing and mature reproductive organs. In some cases this variation is correlated with changes in sequence elements in the Gld promoter which were previously shown to direct tissue-specific expression in the reproductive tract. In particular D. teissieri adult males do not express GLD in their ejaculatory ducts, atypical of the melanogaster subgroup species. The Gld promoter region of D. teissieri specifically lacks all three of the TTAGA regulatory elements present in D. melanogaster. The TTAGA elements were previously shown to direct reporter gene expression to the ejaculatory duct. Together these data suggest the absence or presence of the TTAGA elements may be responsible for variation in the absence or presence of GLD in the ejaculatory duct among species.",1994,"J L Ross, P P Fong, D R Cavener, J L Ross, P P Fong, D R Cavener"
Altered Actin Filament Dynamics in the Drosophila Mushroom Bodies Lead to Fast Acquisition of Alcohol Consumption Preference,31558618,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0973-19.2019,"Alcohol use is highly prevalent in the United States and across the world, and every year millions of people suffer from alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Although the genetic contribution to developing AUDs is estimated to be 50-60%, many of the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Previous studies from our laboratory revealed that Drosophila melanogaster lacking RhoGAP18B and Ras Suppressor 1 (Rsu1) display reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation. Both Rsu1 and RhoGAP18B are negative regulators of the small Rho-family GTPase, Rac1, a modulator of actin dynamics. Here we investigate the role of Rac1 and its downstream target, the actin-severing protein cofilin, in alcohol consumption preference. We show that these two regulators of actin dynamics can alter male experience-dependent alcohol preference in a bidirectional manner: expressing either activated Rac1 or dominant-negative cofilin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) abolishes experience-dependent alcohol preference. Conversely, dominant-negative Rac1 or activated cofilin MB expression lead to faster acquisition of alcohol preference. Our data show that Rac1 and cofilin activity are key to determining the rate of acquisition of alcohol preference, revealing a critical role of actin dynamics regulation in the development of voluntary self-administration in Drosophila SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The risks for developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are strongly determined by genetic factors. Understanding the genes and molecular mechanisms that contribute to that risk is therefore a necessary first step for the development of targeted therapeutic intervention. Here we show that regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics can bidirectionally determine the acquisition rate of alcohol self-administration, highlighting this process as a key mechanism contributing to the risk of AUD development.",2019,"Andrew R Butts, Shamsideen A Ojelade, Eva D Pronovost, Alexandra Seguin, Collin B Merrill, Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh, Andrew R Butts, Shamsideen A Ojelade, Eva D Pronovost, Alexandra Seguin, Collin B Merrill, Aylin R Rodan, Adrian Rothenfluh"
Rapid and efficient purification of Drosophila homeodomain transcription factors for biophysical characterization,30738927,10.1016/j.pep.2019.02.001,"Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) are a large class of evolutionarily conserved DNA binding proteins that contain a basic 60-amino acid region required for binding to specific DNA sites. In Drosophila melanogaster, many of these HD TFs are expressed in the early embryo and control transcription of target genes in development through their interaction with cis-regulatory modules. Previous studies where some of the Drosophila HD TFs were purified required the use of strong denaturants (i.e. 6 M urea) and multiple chromatography columns, making the downstream biochemical examination of the isolated protein difficult. To circumvent these obstacles, we have developed a streamlined expression and purification protocol to produce large yields of Drosophila HD TFs. Using the HD TFs FUSHI-TARAZU (FTZ), ANTENNAPEDIA (ANTP), ABDOMINAL-A (ABD-A), ABDOMINAL-B (ABD-B), and ULTRABITHORAX (UBX) as examples, we demonstrate that our 3-day protocol involving the overexpression of His6-SUMO fusion constructs in E. coli followed by a Ni2+-IMAC, SUMO-tag cleavage with the SUMO protease Ulp1, and a heparin column purification produces pure, soluble protein in biological buffers around pH 7 in the absence of denaturants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) confirm that the purified HD proteins are functional and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra confirm that the purified HDs are well-folded.

Fos metamorphoses: Lessons from mutants in model organisms,29753813,10.1016/j.mod.2018.05.006,"The Fos oncogene gene family is evolutionarily conserved throughout Eukarya. Fos proteins characteristically have a leucine zipper and a basic region with a helix-turn-helix motif that binds DNA. In vertebrates, there are several Fos homologs. They can homo- or hetero-dimerize via the leucine zipper domain. Fos homologs coupled with other transcription factors, like Jun oncoproteins, constitute the Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) complex. From its original inception as an oncogene, the subsequent finding that they act as transcription factors binding DNA sequences known as TRE, to the realization that they are activated in many different scenarios, and to loss-of-function analysis, the Fos proteins have traversed a multifarious path in development and physiology. They are instrumental in 'immediate early genes' responses, and activated by a seemingly myriad assemblage of different stimuli. Yet, the majority of these studies were basically gain-of-function studies, since it was thought that Fos genes would be cell lethal. Loss-of-function mutations in vertebrates were recovered later, and were not cell lethal. In fact, c-fos null mutations are viable with developmental defects (osteopetrosis and myeloid lineage abnormalities). It was then hypothesized that vertebrate genomes exhibit partial redundancy, explaining the 'mild' phenotypes, and complicating assessment of complete loss-of-function phenotypes. Due to its promiscuous activation, fos genes (especially c-fos) are now commonly used as markers for cellular responses to stimuli. fos homologs high sequence conservation (including Drosophila) is advantageous as it allows critical assessment of fos genes functions in this genetic model. Drosophila melanogaster contains only one fos homolog, the gene kayak. kayak mutations are lethal, and allow study of all the processes where fos is required. The kayak locus encodes several different isoforms, and is a pleiotropic gene variously required for development involving cell shape changes. In general, fos genes seem to primarily activate programs involved in cellular architectural rearrangements and cell shape changes.",2018,"Carlos Alfonso-Gonzalez, Juan Rafael Riesgo-Escovar, Carlos Alfonso-Gonzalez, Juan Rafael Riesgo-Escovar"
Age-Related Changes in the Expression of the Circadian Clock Protein PERIOD in Drosophila Glial Cells,29375400,10.3389/fphys.2017.01131,"Circadian clocks consist of molecular negative feedback loops that coordinate physiological, neurological, and behavioral variables into ""circa"" 24-h rhythms. Rhythms in behavioral and other circadian outputs tend to weaken during aging, as evident in progressive disruptions of sleep-wake cycles in aging organisms. However, less is known about the molecular changes in the expression of clock genes and proteins that may lead to the weakening of circadian outputs. Western blot studies have demonstrated that the expression of the core clock protein PERIOD (PER) declines in the heads of aged Drosophila melanogaster flies. This age-related decline in PER does not occur in the central pacemaker neurons but has been demonstrated so far in retinal photoreceptors. Besides photoreceptors, clock proteins are also expressed in fly glia, which play important roles in neuronal homeostasis and are further categorized into subtypes based on morphology and function. While previous studies of mammalian glial cells have demonstrated the presence of functional clocks in astrocytes and microglia, it is not known which glial cell types in Drosophila express clock proteins and how their expression may change in aged individuals. Here, we conducted immunocytochemistry experiments to identify which glial subtypes express PER protein suggestive of functional circadian clocks. Glial cell subtypes that showed night-time accumulation and day-time absence in PER consistent with oscillations reported in the pacemaker neurons were selected to compare the level of PER protein between young and old flies. Our data demonstrate that some glial subtypes show rhythmic PER expression and the relative PER levels become dampened with advanced age. Identification of glial cell types that display age-related dampening of PER levels may help to understand the cellular changes that contribute to the loss of homeostasis in the aging brain.",2018,"Dani M Long, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz, Dani M Long, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"
Drosophila Courtship Conditioning As a Measure of Learning and Memory,28605393,10.3791/55808,"Many insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory have been elucidated through the use of simple behavioral assays in model organisms such as the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is useful for understanding the basic neurobiology underlying cognitive deficits resulting from mutations in genes associated with human cognitive disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID) and autism. This work describes a methodology for testing learning and memory using a classic paradigm in Drosophila known as courtship conditioning. Male flies court females using a distinct pattern of easily recognizable behaviors. Premated females are not receptive to mating and will reject the male's copulation attempts. In response to this rejection, male flies reduce their courtship behavior. This learned reduction in courtship behavior is measured over time, serving as an indicator of learning and memory. The basic numerical output of this assay is the courtship index (CI), which is defined as the percentage of time that a male spends courting during a 10 min interval. The learning index (LI) is the relative reduction of CI in flies that have been exposed to a premated female compared to naïve flies with no previous social encounters. For the statistical comparison of LIs between genotypes, a randomization test with bootstrapping is used. To illustrate how the assay can be used to address the role of a gene relating to learning and memory, the pan-neuronal knockdown of Dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (Dhap-at) was characterized here. The human ortholog of Dhap-at, glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPT), is involved in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 2, an autosomal-recessive syndrome characterized by severe ID. Using the courtship conditioning assay, it was determined that Dhap-at is required for long-term memory, but not for short-term memory.

RNAi of arcRNA hsrω affects sub-cellular localization of Drosophila FUS to drive neurodiseases,28342748,10.1016/j.expneurol.2017.03.011,"Defective RNA metabolism is common pathogenic mechanisms involved in neurological disorders. Indeed, a conspicuous feature of some neurodegenerative diseases is the loss of nuclear activities of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) like Fused in sarcoma (FUS) and eventually, their accumulation in cytoplasmic proteinaceous inclusions. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of tissue physiology and disease processes, including neurological disorders. A subset of these lncRNAs is the core of nuclear bodies (NBs), which are the sites of RNA processing and sequestration of specific ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) complexes. In Drosophila melanogaster the lncRNA hsrω is the architectural RNA (arcRNA) of the NB omega speckles (ω-speckles). Here, we show that the neuron-specific and motor neuron-specific knockdown of hsrω impairs locomotion in larval and adult flies and induces anatomical defects in presynaptic terminals of motor neurons, suggesting a novel role of arcRNA hsrω in development of neuromuscular junctions. Since RBPs are recognized as important regulators of neuronal activities, to examine the molecular mechanism of such neurodegeneration, we analysed interaction between hsrω and Drosophila orthologue of human FUS (dFUS). Strictly, we found that dFUS genetically and physically interacts with the arcRNA hsrω. Moreover, we revealed that a fine regulation of gene expression occurs between hsrω and dFUS and surprisingly, we uncover that depletion of hsrω affects the sub-cellular compartmentalization of dFUS thus, enhancing its cytoplasmic localization and inducing its loss of nuclear function. The model we propose shows the role of arcRNA in diseases affecting the nervous system and in particular it elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of dFUS nuclear function in the absence of its mutations. Our new findings could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease dependent on mis-function or mis-localization of aggregation prone RNA binding proteins like FUS in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.",2017,"Luca Lo Piccolo, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Luca Lo Piccolo, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"
"Differential mechanisms of action of the mucolipin synthetic agonist, ML-SA1, on insect TRPML and mammalian TRPML1",25266962,10.1016/j.ceca.2014.09.004,"Mucolipin synthetic agonist 1 (ML-SA1) was recently identified to activate mammalian TRPML channels and shown to alleviate lipid accumulation in lysosomes of cellular models of lysosome storage diseases, mucolipidosis type IV (MLIV) and Niemann-Pick's disease type C (NPC). Owning to its potential use in complimenting genetic studies in Drosophila melanogaster to elucidate the cellular and physiological functions of TRPML channels, we examined the effect of ML-SA1 on Drosophila TRPML expressed in HEK293 cells using whole-cell, inside-out, and whole-lysosome electrophysiological recordings. We previously showed that when expressed in HEK293 cells, Drosophila TRPML was localized and functional on both plasma membrane and endolysosome. We show here that in both inside-out patches excised from the plasma membrane and whole-lysosome recordings from enlarged endolysosome vacuoles, ML-SA1 failed to activate TRPML unless exogenous phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2] was applied. At 1 μM ML-SA1, the sensitivity of TRPML to PI(3,5)P2 increased approximately by 10-fold and at 10 μM ML-SA1, the deactivation of PI(3,5)P2-evoked TRPML currents was markedly slowed. On the other hand, constitutive activation of TRPML by a mutation that mimics the varitint-waddler (Va) mutation of mouse TRPML3 rendered the insect channel sensitive to activation by ML-SA1 alone. Moreover, different from the insect TRPML, mouse TRPML1 was readily activated by ML-SA1 independent of PI(3,5)P2. Thus, our data reveal that while ML-SA1 acts as a true agonist at mouse TRPML1, it behaves as an allosteric activator of the Drosophila TRPML, showing dependence on and the ability to stabilize open conformation of the insect channels.",2014,"Xinghua Feng, Jian Xiong, Yungang Lu, Xuefeng Xia, Michael X Zhu, Xinghua Feng, Jian Xiong, Yungang Lu, Xuefeng Xia, Michael X Zhu"
Unique and shared functions of nuclear lamina LEM domain proteins in Drosophila,24700158,10.1534/genetics.114.162941,"The nuclear lamina is an extensive protein network that contributes to nuclear structure and function. LEM domain (LAP2, emerin, MAN1 domain, LEM-D) proteins are components of the nuclear lamina, identified by a shared ∼45-amino-acid motif that binds Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF), a chromatin-interacting protein. Drosophila melanogaster has three nuclear lamina LEM-D proteins, named Otefin (Ote), Bocksbeutel (Bocks), and dMAN1. Although these LEM-D proteins are globally expressed, loss of either Ote or dMAN1 causes tissue-specific defects in adult flies that differ from each other. The reason for such distinct tissue-restricted defects is unknown. Here, we generated null alleles of bocks, finding that loss of Bocks causes no overt adult phenotypes. Next, we defined phenotypes associated with lem-d double mutants. Although the absence of individual LEM-D proteins does not affect viability, loss of any two proteins causes lethality. Mutant phenotypes displayed by lem-d double mutants differ from baf mutants, suggesting that BAF function is retained in animals with a single nuclear lamina LEM-D protein. Interestingly, lem-d double mutants displayed distinct developmental and cellular mutant phenotypes, suggesting that Drosophila LEM-D proteins have developmental functions that are differentially shared with other LEM-D family members. This conclusion is supported by studies showing that ectopically produced LEM-D proteins have distinct capacities to rescue the tissue-specific phenotypes found in single lem-d mutants. Our findings predict that cell-specific mutant phenotypes caused by loss of LEM-D proteins reflect both the constellation of LEM-D proteins within the nuclear lamina and the capacity of functional compensation of the remaining LEM-D proteins.",2014,"Lacy J Barton, Shameika R Wilmington, Melinda J Martin, Hannah M Skopec, Kaylee E Lovander, Belinda S Pinto, Pamela K Geyer, Lacy J Barton, Shameika R Wilmington, Melinda J Martin, Hannah M Skopec, Kaylee E Lovander, Belinda S Pinto, Pamela K Geyer"

In the present study, specific knockdown of Drosophila NF-YB (dNF-YB) in eye imaginal discs induced a rough eye phenotype in adults and this phenotype was the result of induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis followed by apoptosis-induced proliferation. Furthermore, knockdown specifically inhibited R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation, independent of the apoptotic function. dNF-YB and dNF-YA indeed form complexes in vivo where they impair R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation by down regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Expression of the sev gene, or the D-raf gene, a downstream component of the MAPK cascade, could rescue the rough eye phenotype and the loss of R7 signals in dNF-YB knockdown flies. The death executioner Bcl-2 (debcl) is the homolog of Bcl-2 in Drosophila melanogaster and its promoter contains four dNF-Y-binding consensus sequences which play positive roles in promoter activity. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with anti-dNF-YB antibody and S2 cells, the debcl gene promoter region containing the NF-Y consensus was effectively amplified in immunoprecipitates by polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, these results indicate that dNF-Y regulates debcl gene expression.",2013,"Luong Linh Ly, Osamu Suyari, Yasuhide Yoshioka, Nguyen Trong Tue, Hideki Yoshida, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Luong Linh Ly, Osamu Suyari, Yasuhide Yoshioka, Nguyen Trong Tue, Hideki Yoshida, Masamitsu Yamaguchi"
"Use of mutagenesis, genetic mapping and next generation transcriptomics to investigate insecticide resistance mechanisms",22768270,10.1371/journal.pone.0040296,"Insecticide resistance is a worldwide problem with major impact on agriculture and human health. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is crucial for the management of the phenomenon; however, this information often comes late with respect to the implementation of efficient counter-measures, particularly in the case of metabolism-based resistance mechanisms. We employed a genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen to Drosophila melanogaster, using a Minos-based construct, and retrieved a line (MiT[w(-)]3R2) resistant to the neonicotinoid insecticide Imidacloprid. Biochemical and bioassay data indicated that resistance was due to increased P450 detoxification. Deep sequencing transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial over- and under-representation of 357 transcripts in the resistant line, including statistically significant changes in mixed function oxidases, peptidases and cuticular proteins. Three P450 genes (Cyp4p2, Cyp6a2 and Cyp6g1) located on the 2R chromosome, are highly up-regulated in mutant flies compared to susceptible Drosophila. One of them (Cyp6g1) has been already described as a major factor for Imidacloprid resistance, which validated the approach. Elevated expression of the Cyp4p2 was not previously documented in Drosophila lines resistant to neonicotinoids. In silico analysis using the Drosophila reference genome failed to detect transcription binding factors or microRNAs associated with the over-expressed Cyp genes. The resistant line did not contain a Minos insertion in its chromosomes, suggesting a hit-and-run event, i.e. an insertion of the transposable element, followed by an excision which caused the mutation. Genetic mapping placed the resistance locus to the right arm of the second chromosome, within a ∼1 Mb region, where the highly up-regulated Cyp6g1 gene is located. The nature of the unknown mutation that causes resistance is discussed on the basis of these results.",2012,"Predrag Kalajdzic, Stefan Oehler, Martin Reczko, Nena Pavlidi, John Vontas, Artemis G Hatzigeorgiou, Charalambos Savakis, Predrag Kalajdzic, Stefan Oehler, Martin Reczko, Nena Pavlidi, John Vontas, Artemis G Hatzigeorgiou, Charalambos Savakis"
TDP-43 mediates degeneration in a novel Drosophila model of disease caused by mutations in VCP/p97,20519548,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5894-09.2010,"Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominantly inherited degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP7) gene. VCP (p97 in mouse, TER94 in Drosophila melanogaster, and CDC48 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a highly conserved AAA(+) (ATPases associated with multiple cellular activities) ATPase that regulates a wide array of cellular processes. The mechanism of IBMPFD pathogenesis is unknown. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism, we developed and characterized a Drosophila model of IBMPFD (mutant-VCP-related degeneration). Based on genetic screening of this model, we identified three RNA-binding proteins that dominantly suppressed degeneration; one of these was TBPH, the Drosophila homolog of TAR (trans-activating response region) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Here we demonstrate that VCP and TDP-43 interact genetically and that disease-causing mutations in VCP lead to redistribution of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm in vitro and in vivo, replicating the major pathology observed in IBMPFD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies. We also demonstrate that TDP-43 redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we determined that a pathogenic mutation in TDP-43 promotes redistribution to the cytoplasm and enhances the genetic interaction with VCP. Together, our results show that degeneration associated with VCP mutations is mediated in part by toxic gain of function of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. We suggest that these findings are likely relevant to the pathogenic mechanism of a broad array of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",2010,"Gillian P Ritson, Sara K Custer, Brian D Freibaum, Jake B Guinto, Dyanna Geffel, Jennifer Moore, Waixing Tang, Matthew J Winton, Manuela Neumann, John Q Trojanowski, Virginia M-Y Lee, Mark S Forman, J Paul Taylor, Gillian P Ritson, Sara K Custer, Brian D Freibaum, Jake B Guinto, Dyanna Geffel, Jennifer Moore, Waixing Tang, Matthew J Winton, Manuela Neumann, John Q Trojanowski, Virginia M-Y Lee, Mark S Forman, J Paul Taylor"
Neurogenetic approaches to habituation and dishabituation in Drosophila,18765288,10.1016/j.nlm.2008.08.003,"We review work in the major model systems for habituation in Drosophila melanogaster, encompassing several sensory modalities and behavioral contexts: visual (giant fiber escape response, landing response); chemical (proboscis extension reflex, olfactory jump response, locomotory startle response, odor-induced leg response, experience-dependent courtship modification); electric (shock avoidance); and mechanical (leg resistance reflex, cleaning reflex). Each model system shows several of Thompson and Spencer's [Thompson, R. F., & Spencer, W. A. (1966). Habituation: A model phenomenon for the study of neuronal substrates of behavior. Psychological Review, 73, 16-43] parametric criteria for habituation: spontaneous recovery and dishabituation have been described in almost all of them and dependence of habituation upon stimulus frequency and stimulus intensity in the majority. Stimulus generalization (and conversely, the delineation of stimulus specificity) has given insights into the localization of habituation or the neural architecture underlying sensory processing. The strength of Drosophila for studying habituation is the range of genetic approaches available. Mutations have been used to modify specific neuroanatomical structures, ion channels, elements of synaptic transmission, and second-messenger pathways. rutabaga and dunce, genes of the cAMP signal pathway that have been studied most often in the reviewed experiments, have also been implicated in synaptic plasticity and associative conditioning in Drosophila and other species including mammals. The use of the Gal4/UAS system for targeting gene expression has enabled genetic perturbation of defined sets of neurons. One clear lesson is that a gene may affect habituation differently in different behaviors, depending on the expression, processing, and localization of the gene product in specific circuits. Mutations of specific genes not only provide links between physiology and behavior in the same circuit, but also reveal common mechanisms in different paradigms of behavioral plasticity. The rich repertoire of models for habituation in the fly is an asset for combining a genetic approach with behavioral, anatomical and physiological methods with the promise of a more complete understanding.",2009,"Jeff E Engel, Chun-Fang Wu, Jeff E Engel, Chun-Fang Wu"
Genome-wide identification of direct targets of the Drosophila retinal determination protein Eyeless,16533912,10.1101/gr.4673006,"The discovery of direct downstream targets of transcription factors (TFs) is necessary for understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying complex, highly regulated processes such as development. In this report, we have used a combinatorial strategy to conduct a genome-wide search for novel direct targets of Eyeless (Ey), a key transcription factor controlling early eye development in Drosophila. To overcome the lack of high-quality consensus binding site sequences, phylogenetic shadowing of known Ey binding sites in sine oculis (so) was used to construct a position weight matrix (PWM) of the Ey protein. This PWM was then used for in silico prediction of potential binding sites in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. To reduce the false positive rate, conservation of these potential binding sites was assessed by comparing the genomic sequences from seven Drosophila species. In parallel, microarray analysis of wild-type versus ectopic ey-expressing tissue, followed by microarray-based epistasis experiments in an atonal (ato) mutant background, identified 188 genes induced by ey. Intersection of in silico predicted conserved Ey binding sites with the candidate gene list produced through expression profiling yields a list of 20 putative ey-induced, eye-enriched, ato-independent, direct targets of Ey. The accuracy of this list of genes was confirmed using both in vitro and in vivo methods. Initial analysis reveals three genes, eyes absent, shifted, and Optix, as novel direct targets of Ey.

Phylogenetic analysis of the putative catalytic domains of the large GalNAc-transferase enzyme families of Drosophila melanogaster (13 available), Caenorhabditis elegans (9 genes), and mammals (12 genes) indicated that distinct subfamilies of orthologous genes are conserved in each species. In support of this hypothesis, we provide evidence that distinctive functional properties of Drosophila and human GalNAc-transferase isoforms were exhibited by evolutionarily conserved members of two subfamilies (dGalNAc-T1 (l(2)35Aa) and GalNAc-T11; dGalNAc-T2 (CG6394) and GalNAc-T7). dGalNAc-T1 and novel human GalNAc-T11 were shown to encode functional GalNAc-transferases with the same polypeptide acceptor substrate specificity, and dGalNAc-T2 was shown to encode a GalNAc-transferase with similar GalNAc glycopeptide substrate specificity as GalNAc-T7.

Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on cultured Drosophila and other insect neurones,7504110,10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019613,"1. Using whole-cell and single channel recordings, we have examined the properties of acetylcholine (ACh)-activated currents in neurones from larval and pupal Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), larval and embryonic Musca domestica (house fly), and nymphal Schistocerca gregaria (locust). 2. In all preparations, single channel recordings revealed two major classes of ACh-activated channels, with average conductances of approximately 32 and 59 pS. 3. At ACh concentrations from 1 to 10 microM, channel activity in Drosophila larval neurones occurs in bursts with an average of 1-2 openings. Open times and burst durations are described by one or two exponentials. Burst durations for the 32 pS channel (approximately 3 ms, slow component) were longer than those for the 59 pS channel (approximately 1.0 ms). The mean open interval duration for the 32 pS channel (slow component) was also longer than that of the 59 pS channel. 4. At high ACh (20-200 microM) concentrations, bursts of the smaller conductance channel occur in clusters separated by long-lived periods without channel activity. Considerable kinetic heterogeneity was observed among clusters. 5. The whole-cell dose-response curve suggests that activation of current by ACh increases up to at least 100 microM and that multiple ligand binding steps are involved. 6. Drosophila and Musca larval neuronal ACh-activated channels show some unique features in their cholinergic pharmacological properties: (a) they are only weakly activated by the potent neuromuscular nicotinic agonist suberyldicholine, (b) hexamethonium and decamethonium are weak, but approximately equi-effective blockers, and (c) alpha- and kappa-bungarotoxin (BTX) both blocked reversibly, though alpha-BTX appears to be the more potent inhibitor.",1993,"J L Albert, C J Lingle, J L Albert, C J Lingle"

Genetic mechanisms controlling anterior expansion of the central nervous system,32143748,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2019.11.005,"In bilaterally-symmetric animals (Bilateria), condensation of neurons and ganglia into a centralized nervous system (CNS) constitutes a salient feature. In most, if not all, Bilateria another prominent aspect is that the anterior regions of the CNS are typically larger than the posterior ones. Detailed studies in Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila) have revealed that anterior expansion in this species stems from three major developmental features: the generation of more progenitors anteriorly, an extended phase of proliferation of anterior progenitors, and more proliferative daughter cells in anterior regions. These brain-specific features combine to generate a larger average lineage size and higher cell numbers in the brain, when compared to more posterior regions. Genetic studies reveal that these anterior-posterior (A-P) differences are controlled by the modulation of temporal programs, common to all progenitors, as well as by Hox homeotic genes, expressed in the nerve cord, and brain-specific factors. All of these regulatory features are gated by the action of the PRC2 epigenetic complex. Studies in mammals indicate that most, if not all of these anterior expansion principles and the underlying genetic programs are evolutionarily conserved. These findings further lend support for the recently proposed idea that the brain and nerve cord may have originated from different parts of the nervous system present in the Bilaterian ancestor. This brain-nerve cord ""fusion"" concept may help explain a number of the well-known fundamental differences in the biology of the brain, when compared to the nerve cord.",2020,"Behzad Yaghmaeian Salmani, Stefan Thor, Behzad Yaghmaeian Salmani, Stefan Thor"

Surprisingly, few reports address and validate this widely accepted perspective. Here we show that Importin-α2 (Imp-α2), a soluble nuclear transporter that shuttles cargoes between the cytoplasm and nucleus, is vital for brain development, learning and persistent memory in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations in importin-α2 (imp-α2, known as Pendulin or Pen and homologous with human KPNA2) are alleles of mushroom body miniature B (mbmB), a gene known to regulate aspects of brain development and influence adult behavior in flies. Mushroom bodies (MBs), paired associative centers in the brain, are smaller than normal due to defective proliferation of specific intrinsic Kenyon cell (KC) neurons in mbmB mutants. Extant KCs projecting to the MB β-lobe terminate abnormally on the contralateral side of the brain. mbmB adults have impaired olfactory learning but normal memory decay in most respects, except that protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory (LTM) is abolished. This observation supports an alternative mechanism of persistent memory in which mutually exclusive protein-synthesis-dependent and -independent forms rely on opposing cellular mechanisms or circuits.

Here, we identify SU(VAR)2-1 as a novel chromatin regulator that directs global histone deacetylation during the transition of cleavage chromatin into somatic blastoderm chromatin in early embryogenesis. SU(VAR)2-1 is heterochromatin-associated in blastoderm nuclei but not in later stages of development. In larval polytene chromosomes, SU(VAR)2-1 is a band-specific protein. SU(VAR)2-1 directs global histone deacetylation by recruiting the histone deacetylase RPD3. In Su(var)2-1 mutants H3K9, H3K27, H4K8 and H4K16 acetylation shows elevated levels genome-wide and heterochromatin displays aberrant histone hyper-acetylation. Whereas H3K9me2- and HP1a-binding appears unaltered, the heterochromatin-specific H3K9me2S10ph composite mark is impaired in heterochromatic chromocenters of larval salivary polytene chromosomes. SU(VAR)2-1 contains an NRF1/EWG domain and a C2HC zinc-finger motif.

Humans are exposed to increased amounts of light in the blue spectrum produced by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can interfere with normal sleep cycles.

We investigated the effects of light in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, and determined that flies maintained in daily cycles of 12-h blue LED and 12-h darkness had significantly reduced longevity compared with flies maintained in constant darkness or in white light with blue wavelengths blocked. Exposure of adult flies to 12 h of blue light per day accelerated aging phenotypes causing damage to retinal cells, brain neurodegeneration, and impaired locomotion. We report that brain damage and locomotor impairments do not depend on the degeneration in the retina, as these phenotypes were evident under blue light in flies with genetically ablated eyes. Blue light induces expression of stress-responsive genes in old flies but not in young, suggesting that cumulative light exposure acts as a stressor during aging.

The domino SWI2/SNF2 Gene Product Represses Cell Death in Drosophila melanogaster,29752350,10.1534/g3.118.200228,"The Drosophila domino locus encodes DNA-dependent ATPases of the SWI2/SNF2 class.

Although domino mutations were also characterized with a cell death phenotype, its association with a death pathway has not been investigated. Here we have used targeted RNA interference to depress domino function in the wing. Resultant wing damage phenotypes were found to be enhanced through overexpression of pro-apoptotic loci, and suppressed through loss of function of these loci. Loss of wing margin and blade tissue was correlated with activation of the effector Caspase Dcp-1, a marker for apoptosis. The affected wing regions also exhibited lower levels of the DIAP1 protein, an inhibitor of apoptosis. The lower level of DIAP1 protein was not correlated with an effect on the activity of a DIAP1 gene transgenic reporter (thread-LacZ), suggesting that loss of DIAP1 occurred post transcriptionally. In some cases excessive cell proliferation within the targeted tissue, measured through BrdU incorporation, was also observed. Finally, we used a transgenic reporter construct to monitor the chromatin state upstream of the proapoptotic reaper locus. In genotypes exhibiting targeted domino loss and wing phenotypes, we observed increased reporter activity only in the affected areas.

Theoretical models describe several mechanisms by which inversions can drive adaptation and be maintained as polymorphisms. While inversions have been shown previously to be under selection, or contain genetic variation under selection, the specific phenotypic consequences of inversions leading to their maintenance remain unclear. Here we use genomic sequence and expression data from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to explore the effects of two cosmopolitan inversions, In(2L)t and In(3R)Mo, on patterns of transcriptional variation. We demonstrate that each inversion has a significant effect on transcript abundance for hundreds of genes across the genome. Inversion-affected loci (IAL) appear both within inversions as well as on unlinked chromosomes. Importantly, IAL do not appear to be influenced by the previously reported genome-wide expression correlation structure. We found that five genes involved with sterol uptake, four of which are Niemann-Pick Type 2 orthologs, are upregulated in flies with In(3R)Mo but do not have SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the inversion. We speculate that this upregulation is driven by genetic variation in mod(mdg4) that is in LD with In(3R)Mo We find that there is little evidence for a regional or position effect of inversions on gene expression at the chromosomal level, but do find evidence for the distal breakpoint of In(3R)Mo interrupting one gene and possibly disassociating the two flanking genes from regulatory elements.",2017,"Erik Lavington, Andrew D Kern, Erik Lavington, Andrew D Kern"
In silico evolution of the Drosophila gap gene regulatory sequence under elevated mutational pressure,28251865,10.1186/s12862-016-0866-y,"Background:
      
    

    
      Cis-regulatory sequences are often composed of many low-affinity transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Determining the evolutionary and functional importance of regulatory sequence composition is impeded without a detailed knowledge of the genotype-phenotype map.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We simulate the evolution of regulatory sequences involved in Drosophila melanogaster embryo segmentation during early development. Natural selection evaluates gene expression dynamics produced by a computational model of the developmental network. We observe a dramatic decrease in the total number of transcription factor binding sites through the course of evolution. Despite a decrease in average sequence binding energies through time, the regulatory sequences tend towards organisations containing increased high affinity transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, the binding energies of separate sequence segments demonstrate ubiquitous mutual correlations through time. Fewer than 10% of initial TFBSs are maintained throughout the entire simulation, deemed 'core' sites. These sites have increased functional importance as assessed under wild-type conditions and their binding energy distributions are highly conserved. Furthermore, TFBSs within close proximity of core sites exhibit increased longevity, reflecting functional regulatory interactions with core sites.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Spreading depolarization in the brain of Drosophila is induced by inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase and mitigated by a decrease in activity of protein kinase G,27358319,10.1152/jn.00353.2016,"Spreading depolarization (SD) is characterized by a massive redistribution of ions accompanied by an arrest in electrical activity that slowly propagates through neural tissue. It has been implicated in numerous human pathologies, including migraine, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, and thus the elucidation of control mechanisms underlying the phenomenon could have many health benefits. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of SD in the brain of Drosophila melanogaster, providing a model system, whereby cellular mechanisms can be dissected using molecular genetic approaches. Propagating waves of SD were reliably induced by disrupting the extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)]o), either directly or by inhibition of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain. The disturbance was monitored by recording the characteristic surges in [K(+)]o using K(+)-sensitive microelectrodes or by monitoring brain activity by measuring direct current potential. With the use of wild-type flies, we show that young adults are more resistant to SD compared with older adults, evidenced by shorter bouts of SD activity and attenuated [K(+)]o disturbances. Furthermore, we show that the susceptibility to SD differs between wild-type flies and w1118 mutants, demonstrating that our ouabain model is influenced by genetic strain. Lastly, flies with low levels of protein kinase G (PKG) had increased latencies to onset of both ouabain-induced SD and anoxic depolarization compared with flies with higher levels. Our findings implicate the PKG pathway as a modulator of SD in the fly brain, and given the conserved nature of the signaling pathway, it could likely play a similar role during SD in the mammalian central nervous system.",2016,"Kristin E Spong, Esteban C Rodríguez, R Meldrum Robertson, Kristin E Spong, Esteban C Rodríguez, R Meldrum Robertson"
Mitonuclear Epistasis for Development Time and Its Modification by Diet in Drosophila,26966258,10.1534/genetics.116.187286,"Mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genes have to operate in a coordinated manner to maintain organismal function, and the regulation of this homeostasis presents a substantial source of potential epistatic (G × G) interactions.

Here we developed a novel mitonuclear epistasis model, using selected strains of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and mitochondrial genomes from within Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to test the hypothesis that mtDNA × nDNA interactions influence fitness. In total we built 72 genotypes (12 nuclear backgrounds × 6 mtDNA haplotypes, with 3 from each species) to dissect the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Each genotype was assayed on four food environments. We found considerable variation in several phenotypes, including development time and egg-to-adult viability, and this variation was partitioned into genetic (G), environmental (E), and higher-order (G × G, G × E, and G × G × E) components. Food type had a significant impact on development time and also modified mitonuclear epistases, evidencing a broad spectrum of G × G × E across these genotypes. Nuclear background effects were substantial, followed by mtDNA effects and their G × G interaction.

Characterizing the physiological and behavioral roles of proctolin in Drosophila melanogaster,26538605,10.1152/jn.00606.2015,"The neuropeptide proctolin (RYLPT) plays important roles as both a neurohormone and a cotransmitter in arthropod neuromuscular systems. We used third-instar Drosophila larvae as a model system to differentiate synaptic effects of this peptide from its direct effects on muscle contractility and to determine whether proctolin can work in a cell-selective manner on muscle fibers. Proctolin did not appear to alter the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials but did induce sustained muscle contractions in preparations where the CNS had been removed and no stimuli were applied to the remaining nerves. Proctolin-induced contractions were dose-dependent, were reduced by knocking down expression of the Drosophila proctolin receptor in muscle tissue, and were larger in some muscle cells than others (i.e., larger in fibers 4, 12, and 13 than in 6 and 7). Proctolin also increased the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions in a dose-dependent manner, and the magnitude of this effect was also larger in some muscle cells than others (again, larger in fibers 4, 12, and 13 than in 6 and 7). Increasing the intraburst impulse frequency and number of impulses per burst increased the magnitude of proctolin's enhancement of nerve-evoked contractions and decreased the threshold and EC50 concentrations for proctolin to enhance nerve-evoked contractions. Reducing proctolin receptor expression decreased the velocity of larval crawling at higher temperatures, and thermal preference in these larvae. Our results suggest that proctolin acts directly on body-wall muscles to elicit slow, sustained contractions and to enhance nerve-evoked contractions, and that proctolin affects muscle fibers in a cell-selective manner.",2016,"Kiel G Ormerod, Olivia K LePine, Maimoona Shahid Bhutta, JaeHwan Jung, Glenn J Tattersall, A Joffre Mercier, Kiel G Ormerod, Olivia K LePine, Maimoona Shahid Bhutta, JaeHwan Jung, Glenn J Tattersall, A Joffre Mercier"
Active chromatin and transcription play a key role in chromosome partitioning into topologically associating domains,26518482,10.1101/gr.196006.115,"Recent advances enabled by the Hi-C technique have unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding that were subsequently linked to disease and gene regulation. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations and find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin.",2016,"Sergey V Ulianov, Ekaterina E Khrameeva, Alexey A Gavrilov, Ilya M Flyamer, Pavel Kos, Elena A Mikhaleva, Aleksey A Penin, Maria D Logacheva, Maxim V Imakaev, Alexander Chertovich, Mikhail S Gelfand, Yuri Y Shevelyov, Sergey V Razin, Sergey V Ulianov, Ekaterina E Khrameeva, Alexey A Gavrilov, Ilya M Flyamer, Pavel Kos, Elena A Mikhaleva, Aleksey A Penin, Maria D Logacheva, Maxim V Imakaev, Alexander Chertovich, Mikhail S Gelfand, Yuri Y Shevelyov, Sergey V Razin"
Body appendages fine-tune posture and moments in freely manoeuvring fruit flies,26347566,10.1242/jeb.122408,"The precise control of body posture by turning moments is key to elevated locomotor performance in flying animals. Although elevated moments for body stabilization are typically produced by wing aerodynamics, animals also steer using drag on body appendages, shifting their centre of body mass, and changing moments of inertia caused by active alterations in body shape. To estimate the instantaneous contribution of each of these components for posture control in an insect, we three-dimensionally reconstructed body posture and movements of body appendages in freely manoeuvring fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by high-speed video and experimentally scored drag coefficients of legs and body trunk at low Reynolds number. The results show that the sum of leg- and abdomen-induced yaw moments dominates wing-induced moments during 17% of total flight time but is, on average, 7.2-times (roll, 3.4-times) smaller during manoeuvring. Our data reject a previous hypothesis on synergistic moment support, indicating that drag on body appendages and mass-shift inhibit rather than support turning moments produced by the wings. Numerical modelling further shows that hind leg extension alters the moments of inertia around the three main body axes of the animal by not more than 6% during manoeuvring, which is significantly less than previously reported for other insects. In sum, yaw, pitch and roll steering by body appendages probably fine-tune turning behaviour and body posture, without providing a significant advantage for posture stability and moment support. Motion control of appendages might thus be part of the insect's trimming reflexes, which reduce imbalances in moment generation caused by unilateral wing damage and abnormal asymmetries of the flight apparatus.",2015,"Ruben Berthé, Fritz-Olaf Lehmann, Ruben Berthé, Fritz-Olaf Lehmann"
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans as Discovery Platforms for Genes Involved in Human Alcohol Use Disorder,26173477,10.1111/acer.12785,"Background:
      
    

    
      Despite the profound clinical significance and strong heritability of alcohol use disorder (AUD), we do not yet have a comprehensive understanding of the naturally occurring genetic variance within the human genome that drives its development. This lack of understanding is likely to be due in part to the large phenotypic and genetic heterogeneities that underlie human AUD. As a complement to genetic studies in humans, many laboratories are using the invertebrate model organisms (iMOs) Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode worm) to identify genetic mechanisms that influence the effects of alcohol (ethanol) on behavior. While these extremely powerful models have identified many genes that influence the behavioral responses to alcohol, in most cases it has remained unclear whether results from behavioral-genetic studies in iMOs are directly applicable to understanding the genetic basis of human AUD.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      In this review, we critically evaluate the utility of the fly and worm models for identifying genes that influence AUD in humans.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Based on results published through early 2015, studies in flies and worms have identified 91 and 50 genes, respectively, that influence 1 or more aspects of behavioral responses to alcohol. Collectively, these fly and worm genes correspond to 293 orthologous genes in humans. Intriguingly, 51 of these 293 human genes have been implicated in AUD by at least 1 study in human populations.

Germ Cell Segregation from the Drosophila Soma Is Controlled by an Inhibitory Threshold Set by the Arf-GEF Steppke,25971667,10.1534/genetics.115.176867,"Germline cells segregate from the soma to maintain their totipotency, but the cellular mechanisms of this segregation are unclear. The Drosophila melanogaster embryo forms a posterior group of primordial germline cells (PGCs) by their division from the syncytial soma. Extended plasma membrane furrows enclose the PGCs in response to the germ plasm protein Germ cell-less (Gcl) and Rho1-actomyosin activity. Recently, we found that loss of the Arf-GEF Steppke (Step) leads to similar Rho1-dependent plasma membrane extensions but from pseudocleavage furrows of the soma. Here, we report that the loss of step also leads to premature formation of a large cell group at the anterior pole of the embryo . These anterior cells lacked germ plasm, but budded and formed at the same time as posterior PGCs, and then divided asynchronously as PGCs also do. With genetic analyses we found that Step normally activates Arf small G proteins and antagonizes Rho1-actomyosin pathways to inhibit anterior cell formation. A uniform distribution of step mRNA around the one-cell embryo cortex suggested that Step restricts cell formation through a global control mechanism. Thus, we examined the effect of Step on PGC formation at the posterior pole. Reducing Gcl or Rho1 levels decreased PGC numbers, but additional step RNAi restored their numbers. Reciprocally, GFP-Step overexpression induced dosage- and Arf-GEF-dependent loss of PGCs, an effect worsened by reducing Gcl or actomyosin pathway activity. We propose that a global distribution of Step normally sets an inhibitory threshold for Rho1 activity to restrict early cell formation to the posterior.",2015,"Donghoon M Lee, Ronit Wilk, Jack Hu, Henry M Krause, Tony J C Harris, Donghoon M Lee, Ronit Wilk, Jack Hu, Henry M Krause, Tony J C Harris"
A cis-regulatory mutation in troponin-I of Drosophila reveals the importance of proper stoichiometry of structural proteins during muscle assembly,25747460,10.1534/genetics.115.175604,"Rapid and high wing-beat frequencies achieved during insect flight are powered by the indirect flight muscles, the largest group of muscles present in the thorax. Any anomaly during the assembly and/or structural impairment of the indirect flight muscles gives rise to a flightless phenotype. Multiple mutagenesis screens in Drosophila melanogaster for defective flight behavior have led to the isolation and characterization of mutations that have been instrumental in the identification of many proteins and residues that are important for muscle assembly, function, and disease. In this article, we present a molecular-genetic characterization of a flightless mutation, flightless-H (fliH), originally designated as heldup-a (hdp-a). We show that fliH is a cis-regulatory mutation of the wings up A (wupA) gene, which codes for the troponin-I protein, one of the troponin complex proteins, involved in regulation of muscle contraction. The mutation leads to reduced levels of troponin-I transcript and protein. In addition to this, there is also coordinated reduction in transcript and protein levels of other structural protein isoforms that are part of the troponin complex. The altered transcript and protein stoichiometry ultimately culminates in unregulated acto-myosin interactions and a hypercontraction muscle phenotype. Our results shed new insights into the importance of maintaining the stoichiometry of structural proteins during muscle assembly for proper function with implications for the identification of mutations and disease phenotypes in other species, including humans.",2015,"Hena Firdaus, Jayaram Mohan, Sarwat Naz, Prabhashankar Arathi, Saraf R Ramesh, Upendra Nongthomba, Hena Firdaus, Jayaram Mohan, Sarwat Naz, Prabhashankar Arathi, Saraf R Ramesh, Upendra Nongthomba"
Temporal integration of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs in isolated insect mushroom body neurons exposes pairing-specific signal processing,25429149,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0714-14.2014,"GABAergic modulation of neuronal activity plays a crucial role in physiological processes including learning and memory in both insects and mammals. During olfactory learning in honeybees (Apis mellifera) and Drosophila melanogaster the temporal relation between excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs critically affects learning. However, the cellular mechanisms of temporal integration of these antagonistic inputs are unknown. To address this question, we use calcium imaging of isolated honeybee and Drosophila Kenyon cells (KCs), which are targets of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs during olfactory learning. In the whole population of honeybee KCs we find that pairing of acetylcholine (ACh) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) Comment: Please use the greek letter for gamma reduces the ACh-induced calcium influx, and depending on their temporal sequence, induces different forms of neuronal plasticity. After ACh-GABA pairing the calcium influx of a subsequent excitatory stimulus is increased, while GABA-ACh pairing affects the decay time leading to elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. In an exactly defined subset of Drosophila KCs implicated in learning we find similar pairing-specific differences. Specifically the GABA-ACh pairing splits the KCs in two functional subgroups: one is only weakly inhibited by GABA and shows no neuronal plasticity and the other subgroup is strongly inhibited by GABA and shows elevated calcium levels during the late phase of a subsequent excitatory stimulus. Our findings provide evidence that insect KCs are capable of contributing to temporal processing of cholinergic and GABAergic inputs, which provides a neuronal mechanism of the differential temporal role of GABAergic inhibition during learning.",2014,"Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller, Davide Raccuglia, Uli Mueller"
An unexpected link between notch signaling and ROS in restricting the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in Drosophila,24318532,10.1534/genetics.113.159210,"A fundamental question in hematopoietic development is how multipotent progenitors achieve precise identities, while the progenitors themselves maintain quiescence. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, multipotent hematopoietic progenitors support the production of three lineages, exhibit quiescence in response to cues from a niche, and from their differentiated progeny. Infection by parasitic wasps alters the course of hematopoiesis. Here we address the role of Notch (N) signaling in lamellocyte differentiation in response to wasp infection. We show that Notch activity is moderately high and ubiquitous in all cells of the lymph gland lobes, with crystal cells exhibiting the highest levels. Wasp infection reduces Notch activity, which results in fewer crystal cells and more lamellocytes. Robust lamellocyte differentiation is induced even in N mutants. Using RNA interference knockdown of N, Serrate, and neuralized (neur), and twin clone analysis of a N null allele, we show that all three genes inhibit lamellocyte differentiation. However, unlike its cell-autonomous function in crystal cell development, Notch's inhibitory influence on lamellocyte differentiation is not cell autonomous. High levels of reactive oxygen species in the lymph gland lobes, but not in the niche, accompany N(RNAi)-induced lamellocyte differentiation and lobe dispersal. Our results define a novel dual role for Notch signaling in maintaining competence for basal hematopoiesis: while crystal cell development is encouraged, lamellocytic fate remains repressed. Repression of Notch signaling in fly hematopoiesis is important for host defense against natural parasitic wasp infections. These findings can serve as a model to understand how reactive oxygen species and Notch signals are integrated and interpreted in vivo.",2014,"Chiyedza Small, Johnny Ramroop, Maria Otazo, Lawrence H Huang, Shireen Saleque, Shubha Govind, Chiyedza Small, Johnny Ramroop, Maria Otazo, Lawrence H Huang, Shireen Saleque, Shubha Govind"
A small cohort of FRU(M) and Engrailed-expressing neurons mediate successful copulation in Drosophila melanogaster,23688386,10.1186/1471-2202-14-57,"Background:
      
    

    
      In Drosophila, male flies require the expression of the male-specific Fruitless protein (FRU(M)) within the developing pupal and adult nervous system in order to produce male courtship and copulation behaviors. Recent evidence has shown that specific subsets of FRU(M) neurons are necessary for particular steps of courtship and copulation. In these neurons, FRU(M) function has been shown to be important for determining sex-specific neuronal characteristics, such as neurotransmitter profile and morphology.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We identified a small cohort of FRU(M) interneurons in the brain and ventral nerve cord by their co-expression with the transcription factor Engrailed (En). We used an En-GAL4 driver to express a fru(M) RNAi construct in order to selectively deplete FRU(M) in these En/FRU(M) co-expressing neurons. In courtship and copulation tests, these males performed male courtship at wild-type levels but were frequently sterile. Sterility was a behavioral phenotype as these En-fru(M)RNAi males were less able to convert a copulation attempt into a stable copulation, or did not maintain copulation for long enough to transfer sperm and/or seminal fluid.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We have identified a population of interneurons necessary for successful copulation in Drosophila. These data confirm a model in which subsets of FRU(M) neurons participate in independent neuronal circuits necessary for individual steps of male behavior. In addition, we have determined that these neurons in wild-type males have homologues in females and fru mutants, with similar placement, projection patterns, and neurochemical profiles.",2013,"Kristin L Latham, Ying-Show Liu, Barbara J Taylor, Kristin L Latham, Ying-Show Liu, Barbara J Taylor"
A cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) controls synaptic transmission tolerance to acute oxidative stress at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction,23136350,10.1152/jn.00784.2011,"Increasing evidence demonstrates that modulating the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) pathway produces an array of behavioral phenotypes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Altering PKG activity, either genetically via the foraging (for) gene or using pharmacology modifies tolerance to acute abiotic stresses such as hyperthermia and hypoxia. PKG signaling has been shown to modulate neuroprotection in many experimental paradigms of acute brain trauma and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. However, relatively little is known about how this stress-induced neuroprotective mechanism affects neural communication. In this study, we investigated the role PKG activity has on synaptic transmission at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) during acute oxidative stress and found that the application of 2.25 mM hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) disrupts synaptic function by rapidly increasing the rate of neuronal failure. Here, we report that reducing PKG activity through either natural genetic variation or an induced mutation of the for gene increases synaptic tolerance during acute oxidative conditions. Furthermore, pharmacological manipulations revealed that neurotransmission is significantly extended during acute H(2)O(2) exposure upon inhibition of the PKG pathway. Conversely, activation of this signaling cascade using either genetics or pharmacology significantly reduced the time until synaptic failure. Therefore, these findings suggest a potential role for PKG activity to regulate the tolerance of synaptic transmission during acute oxidative stress, where inhibition promotes functional protection while activation increases susceptibility to neurotransmission breakdown.",2013,"Stacee Lee Caplan, Sarah L Milton, Ken Dawson-Scully, Stacee Lee Caplan, Sarah L Milton, Ken Dawson-Scully"
Systematic functional characterization of putative zinc transport genes and identification of zinc toxicosis phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster,22693027,10.1242/jeb.069260,"The heavy metal zinc is an essential component of the human diet and is incorporated as a structural component in up to 10% of all mammalian proteins. The physiological importance of zinc homeostasis at the cellular level and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have become topics of increasing interest in recent years. We have performed a systematic functional characterization of the majority of the predicted Drosophila Zip (zinc/iron regulated transporter-related protein) and ZnT genes, using the Gal4-UAS system to carry out both ubiquitous and targeted over-expression and suppression studies for 13 of the 17 putative zinc transport genes identified to date. We found that six of these 13 genes may be essential for fly viability and that three of the remaining seven demonstrate over-expression phenotypes. Our findings reaffirm the previously proposed function of dZnT63C (CG17723: FBgn005432) as an important zinc efflux protein and indicate that the fly homolog of hZip1, dZip42C.1 (CG9428: FBgn0033096), is a strong zinc importer in Drosophila. By combining over-expression of dZip42C.1 with suppression of dZnT63C we were able to produce easily identifiable zinc toxicosis phenotypes, which can be rescued or worsened by modifying dietary zinc content.

Modulation of catalytic activity in multi-domain protein tyrosine phosphatases,21931847,10.1371/journal.pone.0024766,"Signaling mechanisms involving protein tyrosine phosphatases govern several cellular and developmental processes. These enzymes are regulated by several mechanisms which include variation in the catalytic turnover rate based on redox stimuli, subcellular localization or protein-protein interactions. In the case of Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (RPTPs) containing two PTP domains, phosphatase activity is localized in their membrane-proximal (D1) domains, while the membrane-distal (D2) domain is believed to play a modulatory role. Here we report our analysis of the influence of the D2 domain on the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the D1 domain using two Drosophila melanogaster RPTPs as a model system. Biochemical studies reveal contrasting roles for the D2 domain of Drosophila Leukocyte antigen Related (DLAR) and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase on Drosophila chromosome band 99A (PTP99A). While D2 lowers the catalytic activity of the D1 domain in DLAR, the D2 domain of PTP99A leads to an increase in the catalytic activity of its D1 domain. Substrate specificity, on the other hand, is cumulative, whereby the individual specificities of the D1 and D2 domains contribute to the substrate specificity of these two-domain enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations on structural models of DLAR and PTP99A reveal a conformational rationale for the experimental observations. These studies reveal that concerted structural changes mediate inter-domain communication resulting in either inhibitory or activating effects of the membrane distal PTP domain on the catalytic activity of the membrane proximal PTP domain.",2011,"Lalima L Madan, S Veeranna, Khader Shameer, Chilamakuri C S Reddy, R Sowdhamini, B Gopal, Lalima L Madan, S Veeranna, Khader Shameer, Chilamakuri C S Reddy, R Sowdhamini, B Gopal"
Identification of a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal in the Drosophila TEA/ATTS protein scalloped,21731746,10.1371/journal.pone.0021431,"Drosophila melanogaster wing development has been shown to rely on the activity of a complex of two proteins, Scalloped (Sd) and Vestigial (Vg). Within this complex, Sd is known to provide DNA binding though its TEA/ATTS domain, while Vg modulates this binding and provides transcriptional activation through N- and C-terminal activation domains. There is also evidence that Sd is required for the nuclear translocation of Vg. Indeed, a candidate sequence which shows consensus to the bipartite family of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) has been identified within Sd previously, though it is not known if it is functional, or if additional unpredicted signals that mediate nuclear transport exist within the protein. By expressing various enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tagged constructs within Drosophila S2 cells, we demonstrate that this NLS is indeed functional and necessary for the proper nuclear localization of Sd. Additionally, the region containing the NLS is critical for the wildtype function of ectopically expressed Sd, in the context of wing development. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified a group of five amino acids within this NLS which is critical for its function, as well as another group of two which is of lesser importance. Together with data that suggests that this sequence mediates interactions with Importin-α3, we conclude that the identified NLS is likely a classical bipartite signal. Further dissection of Sd has also revealed that a large portion of the C-terminal domain of the protein is required its proper nuclear localization. Finally, a Leptomycin B (LB) sensitive signal which appears to facilitate nuclear export is identified, raising the possibility that Sd also contains a nuclear export signal (NES).",2011,"Adam C Magico, John B Bell, Adam C Magico, John B Bell"
Coe genes are expressed in differentiating neurons in the central nervous system of protostomes,21695052,10.1371/journal.pone.0021213,"Genes of the coe (collier/olfactory/early B-cell factor) family encode Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors that are widely conserved in metazoans and involved in many developmental processes, neurogenesis in particular. Whereas their functions during vertebrate neural tube formation have been well documented, very little is known about their expression and role during central nervous system (CNS) development in protostomes. Here we characterized the CNS expression of coe genes in the insect Drosophila melanogaster and the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii, which belong to different subgroups of protostomes and show strikingly different modes of development. In the Drosophila ventral nerve cord, we found that the Collier-expressing cells form a subpopulation of interneurons with diverse molecular identities and neurotransmitter phenotypes. We also demonstrate that collier is required for the proper differentiation of some interneurons belonging to the Eve-Lateral cluster. In Platynereis dumerilii, we cloned a single coe gene, Pdu-coe, and found that it is exclusively expressed in post mitotic neural cells. Using an original technique of in silico 3D registration, we show that Pdu-coe is co-expressed with many different neuronal markers and therefore that, like in Drosophila, its expression defines a heterogeneous population of neurons with diverse molecular identities. Our detailed characterization and comparison of coe gene expression in the CNS of two distantly-related protostomes suggest conserved roles of coe genes in neuronal differentiation in this clade. As similar roles have also been observed in vertebrates, this function was probably already established in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians.",2011,"Adrien Demilly, Elena Simionato, David Ohayon, Pierre Kerner, Alain Garcès, Michel Vervoort, Adrien Demilly, Elena Simionato, David Ohayon, Pierre Kerner, Alain Garcès, Michel Vervoort"
Intrinsic disorder of Drosophila melanogaster hormone receptor 38 N-terminal domain,21064127,10.1002/prot.22887,"Drosophila hormone receptor 38 (dHR38), an ortholog of the vertebrate NR4A subclass of nuclear receptors, responds to ecdysteroids, which mediate developmental transitions during the Drosophila life cycle. However, this response is independent of the ecdysteroid receptor, and it does not involve binding of ecdysteroids to dHR38. It has been suggested that ecdysteroids may indirectly activate dHR38, perhaps by recruiting specific proteins. There have been recent reports pointing out the decisive role that nuclear receptor N-terminal domains (NTDs) have in protein-protein interactions that are important for regulation of gene expression. It is reasonable to assume that dHR38-NTD may also be involved in some protein-protein interactions that are critical for the ecdysteroid signaling pathway. To facilitate the exploration of the molecular basis of these interactions, we developed and optimized a protocol for the efficient expression and purification of the recombinant dHR38-NTD. Using a diverse array of biochemical and biophysical methods, we carried out the first structural characterization of dHR38-NTD. The results of our study indicate that dHR38-NTD exhibits a characteristic reminiscent of pre-molten globule-like intrinsically disordered proteins existing in a partially unfolded conformation with regions of secondary structures. The dHR38-NTD structure, which apparently comprises some local, ordered, tertiary structure clusters, is pliable and can adopt more ordered conformations in response to changes in environmental conditions.

Competition between SOCS36E and Drk modulates Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase activity,20980384,10.1242/jcs.071134,"Modulation of signalling pathways can trigger different cellular responses, including differences in cell fate. This modulation can be achieved by controlling the pathway activity with great precision to ensure robustness and reproducibility of the specification of cell fate. The development of the photoreceptor R7 in the Drosophila melanogaster retina has become a model in which to investigate the control of cell signalling. During R7 specification, a burst of Ras small GTPase (Ras) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) controlled by Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase (Sev) is required. Several cells in each ommatidium express sev. However, the spatiotemporal expression of the boss ligand and the action of negative regulators of the Sev pathway will restrict the R7 fate to a single cell. The Drosophila suppressor of cytokine signalling 36E (SOCS36E) protein contains an SH2 domain and acts as a Sev signalling attenuator. By contrast, downstream of receptor kinase (Drk), the fly homolog of the mammalian Grb2 adaptor protein, which also contains an SH2 domain, acts as a positive activator of the pathway. Here, we apply the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to transfected Drosophila S2 cells and demonstrate that Sev binds directly to either the suppressor protein SOCS36E or the adaptor protein Drk. We propose a mechanistic model in which the competition between these two proteins for binding to the same docking site results in either attenuation of the Sev transduction in cells that should not develop R7 photoreceptors or amplification of the Ras-MAPK signal only in the R7 precursor.",2010,"Isabel Almudi, Montserrat Corominas, Florenci Serras, Isabel Almudi, Montserrat Corominas, Florenci Serras"

      Despite the importance of egg development to the female life cycle in Drosophila, global patterns of gene expression have not been examined in detail, primarily due to the difficulty in isolating synchronised developmental stages in sufficient quantities for gene expression profiling. Entry into vitellogenesis is a key stage of oogenesis and by forcing females into reproductive diapause we are able to arrest oogenesis at the pre-vitellogenic stages. Releasing females from diapause allows collection of relatively synchronous developing egg populations and an investigation of some of the transcriptional dynamics apparent before and after reproductive diapause.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Focusing on gender-biased transcription, we identified mechanisms of egg development suppressed during reproductive dormancy as well as other molecular changes unique to the diapausing female. A microarray based analysis generated a set of 3565 transcripts with at least 2-fold greater expression in females as compared to control males, 1392 such changes were biased during reproductive dormancy. In addition, we also detect 1922 up-regulated transcriptional changes after entry into vitellogenesis, which were classified into discrete blocks of co-expression. We discuss some of the regulatory aspects apparent after re-initiation of egg development, exploring the underlying functions, maternal contribution and evolutionary conservation of co-expression patterns involved in egg production.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Although much of the work we present is descriptive, fundamental aspects of egg development and gender-biased transcription can be derived from our time-series experiment. We believe that our dataset will facilitate further exploration of the developmental and evolutionary characteristics of oogenesis as well as the nature of reproductive arrest in Drosophila.",2009,"Dean A Baker, Steven Russell, Dean A Baker, Steven Russell"
Identifying cis-regulatory elements by statistical analysis and phylogenetic footprinting and analyzing their coexistence and related gene ontology,17848606,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00085.2006,"Discovery of cis-regulatory elements in gene promoters is a highly challenging research issue in computational molecular biology. This paper presents a novel approach to searching putative cis-regulatory elements in human promoters by first finding 8-mer sequences of high statistical significance from gene promoters of humans, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively, and then identifying the most conserved ones across the three species (phylogenetic footprinting). In this study, a conservation analysis on both closely related species (humans and mice) and distantly related species (humans/mice and Drosophila) is conducted not only to examine more candidates but also to improve the prediction accuracy. We have found 124 putative cis-regulatory elements and grouped these into 20 clusters. The investigation on the coexistence of these clusters in human gene promoters reveals that SP1, EGR, and NRF-1 are the dominant clusters appearing in the combinatorial combination of up to five clusters. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis also shows that many GO categories of transcription factors binding to these cis-regulatory elements match the GO categories of genes whose promoters contain these elements. Compared with previous research, the contribution of this study lies not only in the finding of new cis-regulatory elements, but also in its pioneering exploration on the coexistence of discovered elements and the GO relationship between transcription factors and regulated genes. This exploration verifies the putative cis-regulatory elements that have been found from this study and also gives new insight on the regulation mechanisms of gene expression.",2007,"Wei Shi, Wanlei Zhou, Dakang Xu, Wei Shi, Wanlei Zhou, Dakang Xu"
Locomotor activity is regulated by D2-like receptors in Drosophila: an anatomic and functional analysis,17443795,10.1002/dneu.20355,"In mammals, dopamine 2-like receptors are expressed in distinct pathways within the central nervous system, as well as in peripheral tissues. Selected neuronal D2-like receptors play a critical role in modulating locomotor activity and, as such, represent an important therapeutic target (e.g. in Parkinson's disease). Previous studies have established that proteins required for dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are highly conserved between mammals and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. These include a fly dopamine 2-like receptor (DD2R; Hearn et al. PNAS 2002 99(22):14554) that has structural and pharmacologic similarity to the human D2-like (D2R). In the current study, we define the spatial expression pattern of DD2R, and functionally characterize flies with reduced DD2 receptor levels. We show that DD2R is expressed in the larval and adult nervous systems, in cell groups that include the Ap-let cohort of peptidergic neurons, as well as in peripheral tissues including the gut and Malpighian tubules. To examine DD2R function in vivo, we generated RNA-interference (RNAi) flies with reduced DD2R expression. Behavioral analysis revealed that these flies show significantly decreased locomotor activity, similar to the phenotype observed in mammals with reduced D2R expression. The fly RNAi phenotype can be rescued by administration of the DD2R synthetic agonist bromocriptine, indicating specificity for the RNAi effect. These results suggest Drosophila as a useful system for future studies aimed at identifying modifiers of dopaminergic signaling/locomotor function.",2007,"Isabelle Draper, Peri T Kurshan, Edward McBride, F Rob Jackson, Alan S Kopin, Isabelle Draper, Peri T Kurshan, Edward McBride, F Rob Jackson, Alan S Kopin"
Known maternal gradients are not sufficient for the establishment of gap domains in Drosophila melanogaster,17196796,10.1016/j.mod.2006.11.001,"Gap genes are among the first transcriptional targets of maternal morphogen gradients in the early Drosophila embryo. However, it remains unclear whether these gradients are indeed sufficient to establish the boundaries of localized gap gene expression patterns. In this study, we address this question using gap gene circuits, which are data-driven mathematical tools for extracting regulatory information from quantitative wild-type gene expression data. We present new, quantitative data on the mRNA expression patterns for the gap genes Krüppel (Kr), knirps (kni) and giant (gt) during the early blastoderm stage of Drosophila development. This data set shows significant differences in timing of gap gene expression compared to previous observations, and reveals that early gap gene expression is highly variable in both space and time. Gene circuit models fit to this data set were used for a detailed regulatory analysis of early gap gene expression. Our analysis shows that the proper balance of maternal repression and activation is essential for the correct positioning of gap domains, and that such balance can only be achieved for early expression of kni. In contrast, our results suggest that early expression of gt requires local neutralization of repressive input in the anterior region of the embryo, and that known maternal gradients are completely insufficient to position the boundaries of the early central Kr domain, or in fact any Kr-like domain in the central region of the blastoderm embryo. Based on this, we propose that unknown additional regulators must be involved in early gap gene regulation.",2007,"Johannes Jaeger, David H Sharp, John Reinitz, Johannes Jaeger, David H Sharp, John Reinitz"
The four members of the Drosophila metallothionein family exhibit distinct yet overlapping roles in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification,16716195,10.1111/j.1365-2443.2006.00971.x,"Four metallothionein genes are present in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, designated MtnA, MtnB, MtnC, MtnD, all of which are transcriptionally induced by heavy metals through the same metal-responsive transcription factor, MTF-1. Here we show, by targeted mutagenesis, that the four metallothionein genes exhibit distinct, yet overlapping, roles in heavy metal homeostasis and toxicity prevention. Among the individual metallothionein mutants, the most prominent distinction between them was that MtnA-defective flies were the most sensitive to copper load, while MtnB-defective flies were the most sensitive to cadmium. Using various reporter gene constructs and mRNA quantification, we show that the MtnA promoter is preferentially induced by copper, while the MtnB promoter is preferentially induced by cadmium. Such a metal preference is also observed at the protein level as the stoichiometric, spectrometric and spectroscopic features of the copper and cadmium complexes with MtnA and MtnB correlate well with a greater stability of copper-MtnA and cadmium-MtnB. Finally, MtnC and MtnD, both of which are very similar to MtnB, display lower copper and cadmium binding capabilities compared to either MtnA or MtnB. In accordance with these binding studies, Drosophila mutants of MtnC or MtnD have a near wild type level of resistance against copper or cadmium load. Furthermore, eye-specific over-expression of MtnA and MtnB, but not of MtnC or MtnD, can rescue a ""rough eye"" phenotype caused by copper load in the eye. Taken together, while the exact roles of MtnC and MtnD remain to be determined, the preferential protection against copper and cadmium toxicity by MtnA and MtnB, respectively, are the result of a combination of promoter preference and metal binding.",2006,"Dieter Egli, Jordi Domènech, Anand Selvaraj, Kuppusamy Balamurugan, Haiqing Hua, Mercè Capdevila, Oleg Georgiev, Walter Schaffner, Sílvia Atrian, Dieter Egli, Jordi Domènech, Anand Selvaraj, Kuppusamy Balamurugan, Haiqing Hua, Mercè Capdevila, Oleg Georgiev, Walter Schaffner, Sílvia Atrian"
Effects of amyloid peptides on A-type K+ currents of Drosophila larval cholinergic neurons,16470685,10.1002/neu.20227,"Accumulation of amyloid (Abeta) peptides has been suggested to be the primary event in Alzheimer's disease. In neurons, K+ channels regulate a number of processes, including setting the resting potential, keeping action potentials short, timing interspike intervals, synaptic plasticity, and cell death. In particular, A-type K+ channels have been implicated in the onset of LTP in mammalian neurons, which is thought to underlie learning and memory. A number of studies have shown that Abeta peptides alter the properties of K+ currents in mammalian neurons. We set out to determine the effects of Abeta peptides on the neuronal A-type K+ channels of Drosophila. Treatment of cells for 18 h with 1 microM Abeta1-42 altered the kinetics of the A-type K+ current, shifting steady-state inactivation to more depolarized potentials and increasing the rate of recovery from inactivation. It also caused a decrease in neuronal viability. Thus it seems that alteration in the properties of the A-type K+ current is a prelude to the amyloid-induced death of neurons. This alteration in the properties of the A-type K+ current may provide a basis for the early memory impairment that was observed prior to neurodegeneration in a recent study of a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line over-expressing the human Abeta1-42 peptide.",2006,"Jackie F Kidd, Laurence A Brown, David B Sattelle, Jackie F Kidd, Laurence A Brown, David B Sattelle"
Male sterility at extreme temperatures: a significant but neglected phenomenon for understanding Drosophila climatic adaptations,16033555,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00914.x,"The thermal range for viability is quite variable among Drosophila species and it has long been known that these variations are correlated with geographic distribution: temperate species are on average more cold tolerant but more heat sensitive than tropical species. At both ends of their viability range, sterile males have been observed in all species investigated so far. This symmetrical phenomenon restricts the temperature limits within which permanent cultures can be kept in the laboratory. Thermal heat sterility thresholds are very variable across species from 23 degrees C in heat sensitive species up to 31 degrees C in heat tolerant species. In Drosophila melanogaster, genetic variations are observed among geographic populations. Tropical populations are more tolerant to heat induced sterility and recover more rapidly than temperate ones. A genetic analysis revealed that about 50% of the difference observed between natural populations was due to the Y chromosome. Natural populations have not reached a selection limit, however: thermal tolerance was still increased by keeping strains at a high temperature, close to the sterility threshold. On the low temperature side, a symmetrical reverse phenomenon seems to exist: temperate populations are more tolerant to cold than tropical ones. Compared to Mammals, drosophilids exhibit two major differences: first, male sterility occurs not only at high temperature, but also at a low temperature; second, sterility thresholds are not evolutionarily constrained, but highly variable. Altogether, significant and sometimes major genetic variations have been observed between species, between geographic races of the same species, and even between strains kept in the laboratory under different thermal regimes. In each case, it is easily argued that the observed variations correspond to adaptations to climatic conditions, and that male sterility is a significant component of fitness and a target of natural selection.",2005,"J R David, L O Araripe, M Chakir, H Legout, B Lemos, G Pétavy, C Rohmer, D Joly, B Moreteau, J R David, L O Araripe, M Chakir, H Legout, B Lemos, G Pétavy, C Rohmer, D Joly, B Moreteau"
Histamine compartments of the Drosophila brain with an estimate of the quantum content at the photoreceptor synapse,15738275,10.1152/jn.00894.2004,"Reliable estimates of the quantum size in histaminergic neurons are not available. We have exploited two unusual opportunities in the fly's (Drosophila melanogaster) visual system to make such determinations for histaminergic photoreceptor synapses: 1) the possibility to microdissect successively from whole fly heads freeze-dried in acetone: the compound eyes; the first optic neuropils, or lamina; and the rest of the brain; and 2) the uniform sheaves of lamina synaptic terminals of photoreceptors R1-R6. We used this organization to count scrupulously the numbers of 30-nm synaptic vesicles from electron micrographs of R1-R6 profiles, and from microdissections we determined the regional contents of histamine in the compound eye, lamina, and central brain. Total head histamine averages 1.98 ng of which 9% was lost after freeze-drying in acetone and a further 28% after the brain was microdissected. Of the remainder, 71% was in the eye and lamina. Assuming that histamine loss from the tissue occurred mostly by diffusion evenly distributed among all regions, the overall lamina content of the head would be 0.1935 ng before dissection. From published values for the volumes of the brain's compartments, the computed regional concentrations of histamine are highest in the lamina (4.35 mM) because of the terminals of R1-R6. The concentration in the retina is approximately 13% that in the lamina, suggesting that most histamine is vesicular. There are approximately 43,500 +/- 7,400 (SD) synaptic vesicles per terminal and, if all histamine is allocated equally and exclusively among these, the vesicle contents would be 858 +/- 304 x 10(-21) moles or approximately 5,000 +/- 1,800 (SD) molecules at an approximate concentration of 670 mM. These values are compared with the vesicle contents at synapses using acetylcholine and catecholamines.",2005,"J A Borycz, J Borycz, A Kubów, R Kostyleva, I A Meinertzhagen, J A Borycz, J Borycz, A Kubów, R Kostyleva, I A Meinertzhagen"
Expression of functional human transferrin in stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells,15296447,10.1021/bp034375a,"Human transferrin (hTf) is a serum glycoprotein involved in Fe3+ transport. Here, a plasmid encoding the hTf gene fused with a hexahistidine (His6) epitope tag under Drosophila metallothionein promoter (pMT) was stably transfected into Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a nonlytic plasmid-based system. Following 3 days of copper sulfate induction, transfected S2 cells were found to secrete hTf into serum-free culture medium at a competitively high expression level of 40.8 microg/mL, producing 6.8 microg/mL/day in a 150-mL spinner flask culture. Purification of secreted recombinant hTf using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) yielded 95.5% pure recombinant hTf with a recovery of 32%. According to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, purified S2 cell-derived His6-tagged recombinant hTf had a molecular weight (76.4 kDa) smaller than that of native apo-hTf (78.0 kDa). 2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns showed recombinant hTf had a simpler and less acidic profile compared to that of native hTf. These data suggest recombinant hTf was incompletely (noncomplex) glycosylated and lacked sialic acids on N-glycans. However, this difference in N-glycan structure compared to native hTf had no effect on the iron-binding activity of recombinant hTf. The present data show that a plasmid-based stable transfection S2 cell system can be successfully employed as an alternative for producing secreted functional recombinant hTf.",2004,"Hye Jung Lim, Yeon Kyu Kim, Dong Soo Hwang, Hyung Joon Cha, Hye Jung Lim, Yeon Kyu Kim, Dong Soo Hwang, Hyung Joon Cha"
Comparison of the effects of pyrokinins and related peptides identified from arthropods on pupariation behaviour in flesh fly (Sarcophaga bullata) larvae (Diptera: Sarcophagidae),15019526,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2003.11.013,"Peptides from the pyrokinin/PBAN family and some structurally related compounds identified in various arthropods were tested for acceleration of puparial contraction in flesh fly larvae. Modifications of behavioural patterns of pupariation were further studied for the active compounds using a behavioural analysis based on the recording of changes in tension of the cuticle. Nine peptides belonging to the pyrokinin/PBAN family (Lem-PK, Pea-PK-5, Lom-PK II, Hez-PBAN, Bom-DH-I), identified in five different insect species, two pyrokinin peptides derived from the genome of Drosophila melanogaster (capa-3, and hugin), and two pyrokinins identified from the white shrimp Penaeus vannamei were very active in the pupariation assay, with threshold doses within the range of 0.1-5.0 pmol larva(-1). High activity was also detected for a related peptide ETH1 from Drosophila. All of these peptides share a C-terminal PRLamide, which is essential and sufficient for the activity. Interestingly, two other structurally related peptides from Drosophila--ETH2 and capa-1--which feature conservative changes (Ile and Val, respectively) at the C-terminal Leu position, were inactive within a physiological range of concentrations. It is clear that the receptor mediating the acceleration of puparial contraction behaviour is sensitive to the introduction of greater steric bulk at the C-terminal Leu position.

Catalytic implications from the Drosophila protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase structure and site-directed mutagenesis,14596598,10.1021/bi034891+,"Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferases (PIMT; EC 2.1.1.77) catalyze the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation of L-isoaspartyl residues that arise spontaneously in proteins with age, thereby initiating a repair process that restores the normal backbone configuration to the damaged polypeptide. In Drosophila melanogaster, overexpression of PIMT in transgenic flies extends the normal life span, suggesting that protein damage can be a limiting factor in longevity. To understand structural features of the Drosophila PIMT (dPIMT) important for catalysis, the crystal structure of dPIMT was determined at a resolution of 2.2 A, and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the role of Ser-60 in catalysis. The core structure of dPIMT is similar to the modified nucleotide-binding fold observed in PIMTs from extreme thermophiles and humans. A striking difference of the dPIMT structure is the rotation of the C-terminal residues by 90 degrees relative to the homologous structures. Effectively, this displacement generates a more open conformation that allows greater solvent access to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is almost completely buried in other PIMT structures. The enzyme may alternate between the open conformation found for dPIMT and the more closed conformations described for other PIMTs during its catalytic cycle, thereby allowing the exchange of substrates and products. Catalysis by dPIMT requires the side chain of the conserved, active site residue Ser-60, since substitution of this residue with Thr, Gln, or Ala reduces or abolishes the methylation of both protein and isoaspartyl peptide substrates.",2003,"Eric J Bennett, Jens Bjerregaard, James E Knapp, David A Chavous, Alan M Friedman, William E Royer Jr, Clare M O'Connor, Eric J Bennett, Jens Bjerregaard, James E Knapp, David A Chavous, Alan M Friedman, William E Royer Jr, Clare M O'Connor"
Efficient measurement of H2O2 resistance in Drosophila using an activity monitor,12815315,10.1023/a:1024145822785,"We have established a method for the efficient measurement of oxidative stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster, using a commercially available activity monitor. Conditions under which flies in glass tubes placed in the monitor can survive over one month at 25 degrees C were optimized. The active periods of flies were reduced by administration of H(2)O(2) into the media in a dose-dependent manner. Although we used only eight flies per assay, far fewer individuals than in conventional methods, it was possible to detect the effects of H(2)O(2) at a statistically significant level. Increased levels of H(2)O(2) resistance were confirmed in transgenic flies overexpressing antioxidant enzymes, catalase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. We applied the method to determine oxidative stress resistance in fly lines bearing insertions of a gene misexpression vector. H(2)O(2) resistance in these flies varied considerably depending on the insertion, and positively correlated with previously determined longevity. We identified one insertion that conferred a significantly higher level of resistance to H(2)O(2) compared to controls. Molecular analysis of the insertion revealed that a misexpressed transcript matched an expressed sequence tag, and suggested that its full-length product was overproduced upon GAL4 activation. Our method should be applicable to the systematic screening for genes involved in the antioxidant mechanism in Drosophila.",2003,"Taro Kaneuchi, Toru Togawa, Takashi Matsuo, Yoshiaki Fuyama, Toshiro Aigaki, Taro Kaneuchi, Toru Togawa, Takashi Matsuo, Yoshiaki Fuyama, Toshiro Aigaki"
Transcription profiling in Drosophila eyes that overexpress the human glaucoma-associated trabecular meshwork-inducible glucocorticoid response protein/myocilin (TIGR/MYOC),12618402,,"The availability of the human genome sequence together with sequenced genomes of several model organisms provides an unprecedented opportunity to utilize comparative genomic approaches for the discovery of genes that contribute to human disease. We have used transgenic flies to establish an experimental paradigm for the discovery of genes that might be involved in the development of glaucoma, a prevalent disease affecting a large segment of the population. Inherited mutations in the trabecular meshwork-inducible glucocorticoid response protein/myocilin (TIGR/MYOC) are associated with juvenile glaucoma and some cases of adult primary open angle glaucoma. The interrelationships between TIGR/MYOC and the development of glaucoma, however, are not understood. We show that overexpression of human TIGR/MYOC in the eyes of Drosophila melanogaster results in distortion of ommatidia accompanied by fluid discharge. High-density oligonucleotide microarrays identified altered expression of 50 transcripts in response to TIGR/MYOC overexpression, including homologs of aquaporin-4 and cytochrome-P450, previously associated with glaucoma, and several proteins of unknown function. We found that expression of Swiss Cheese, a neurodegenerative protein, increased 34-fold and that its human ortholog, neuropathy target esterase, is also upregulated in response to adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TIGR/MYOC in perfused postmortem human eyes.

Regulation of P-element transposase activity in Drosophila melanogaster by hobo transgenes that contain KP elements,12019235,,"Fusions between the Drosophila hsp70 promoter and three different incomplete P elements, KP, SP, and BP1, were inserted into the Drosophila genome by means of hobo transformation vectors and the resulting transgenic stocks were tested for repression of P-element transposase activity. Only the H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed transposase activity, and the degree of repression was comparable to that of a naturally occurring KP element. The KP transgenes repressed transposase activity both with and without heat-shock treatments. Both the KP element and H(hsp/KP) transgenes repressed the transposase activity encoded by the modified P element in the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene more effectively than that encoded by the complete P element in the H(hsp/CP)2 transgene even though the P(ry(+), Delta2-3)99B transgene was the stronger transposase source. Repression of both transposase sources appeared to be due to a zygotic effect of the KP element or transgene. There was no evidence for repression by a strictly maternal effect; nor was there any evidence for enhancement of KP repression by the joint maternal transmission of H(hsp/KP) and H(hsp/CP) transgenes. These results are consistent with the idea that KP-mediated repression of P-element activity involves a KP-repressor polypeptide that is not maternally transmitted and that KP-mediated repression is not strengthened by the 66-kD repressor produced by complete P elements through alternate splicing of their RNA.",2002,"Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong, Michael J Simmons, Kevin J Haley, Craig D Grimes, John D Raymond, Joseph C L Fong"
Overexpression of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma results in depletion of mitochondrial DNA in Drosophila melanogaster,11016831,10.1007/s004380000301,"The mechanisms involved in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication, a process that is crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis, are not well understood. In this study, we evaluate the role of DNA polymerase gamma (pol gamma), the key enzyme in mtDNA replication, in both Drosophila cell culture and in developing flies. We report that overexpression of the pol gamma catalytic subunit (pol gamma-alpha) in cultured Schneider cells does not alter either the amount of mtDNA or the growth rate of the culture. The polypeptide is properly targeted to mitochondria, yet the large excess of pol gamma-alpha does not interfere with mtDNA replication under these conditions where the endogenous polypeptide is apparently present in amounts that exceed of the demand for its function in the cell. In striking contrast, overexpression of pol gamma-alpha at the same level in transgenic flies interferes with the mtDNA replication process, presumably by altering the mechanism of DNA synthesis, suggesting differential requirements for, and/or regulation of, mtDNA replication in Drosophila cell culture versus the developing organism. Overexpression of pol gamma-alpha in transgenic flies produces a significant depletion of mtDNA that causes a broad variety of phenotypic effects. These alterations range from pupal lethality to moderate morphological abnormalities in adults. depending on the level and temporal pattern of overexpression.

TAK1 function has been extensively studied in cultured cells, but its in vivo function is not fully understood. In this study, we isolated a Drosophila homolog of TAK1 (dTAK1) which contains an extensively conserved NH(2)-terminal kinase domain and a partially conserved COOH-terminal domain. To learn about possible endogenous roles of TAK1 during animal development, we generated transgenic flies which express dTAK1 or the mouse TAK1 (mTAK1) gene in the fly visual system. Ectopic activation of TAK1 signaling leads to a small eye phenotype, and genetic analysis reveals that this phenotype is a result of ectopically induced apoptosis. Genetic and biochemical analyses also indicate that the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is specifically activated by TAK1 signaling. Expression of a dominant negative form of dTAK during embryonic development resulted in various embryonic cuticle defects including dorsal open phenotypes.

The behavioral responses of hono mutants to repellents such as ethyl acetate (EA), benzaldehyde (BZ) and 4-methylcycrohexanol (MCH), were reduced compared with those of a control strain. The location of the P-element insertion was determined to be about 100bp) upstream of the first exon of the tyramine receptor gene. The level of 3.6kb tyramine receptor mRNA expression was reduced in hono compared with that of wild-type flies. The tyramine receptor cDNA hybridized to the chromosomal division 79C-D, the same locus as the P-element insertion point in hono, and not to 99A-B, previously reported by Arakawa et al. (1990. Neuron 2, 343-354). Electrophysiological responses to octopamine and tyramine were examined by measuring the excitatory junctional potential (EJP) amplitude from larval body-wall muscles of the hono mutant. The hono was impaired with responding to tyramine, while displaying normal response to octopamine. These results indicate that tyramine has a functional role in the Drosophila olfactory system as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator, and hono is the first tyramine receptor mutant.

Role of posttranscriptional regulation in circadian clocks: lessons from Drosophila,10442235,10.3109/07420529908998716,"Incredible progress has been made in the last few years in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying circadian clocks. Many of the recent insights have been gained by the isolation and characterization of novel clock mutants and their associated gene products. As might be expected based on theoretical considerations and earlier studies that indicated the importance of temporally regulated macromolecular synthesis for the manifestation of overt rhythms, daily oscillations in the levels of ""clock"" RNAs and proteins are a pervasive feature of these timekeeping devices. How are these molecular rhythms generated and synchronized? Recent evidence accumulated from a wide variety of model organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals, points toward an emerging trend; at the ""heart"" of circadian oscillators lies a cell autonomous transcriptional feedback loop that is composed of alternatively functioning positive and negative elements. Nonetheless, it is also clear that to bring this transcriptional feedback loop to ""life"" requires important contributions from posttranscriptional regulatory schemes. For one thing, there must be times in the day when the activities of negative-feedback regulators are separated from the activities of the positive regulators they act on, or else the oscillatory potential of the system will be dissipated, resulting in a collection of molecules at steady state. This review mainly summarizes the role of posttranscriptional regulation in the Drosophila melanogaster time-keeping mechanism. Accumulating evidence from Drosophila and other systems suggests that posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms increase the dynamic range of circadian transcriptional feedback loops, overlaying them with appropriately timed biochemical constraints that not only engender these loops with precise daily periods of about 24 h, but also with the ability to integrate and respond rapidly to multiple environmental cues such that their phases are aligned optimally to the prevailing external conditions.",1999,"I Edery, I Edery"
The cell cycle program in germ cells of the Drosophila embryo,9576829,10.1006/dbio.1998.8855,"The germ cells of metazoans follow a program of proliferation that is distinct from proliferation programs of somatic cells. Despite their developmental importance, the cell proliferation program in the metazoan primordial germ cells is not well characterized and the regulatory controls are not understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, germ cell precursors (called pole cells) proliferate early in embryogenesis and then enter a prolonged quiescence. We found that polar nuclear divisions are asynchronous and lag behind somatic nuclear divisions during syncytial cycles 9 and 10. Thus, the polar division program deviates from the somatic division program when pole nuclei and somatic nuclei still share a common cytoplasm, earlier than previously thought. The lag in polar nuclear divisions is independent of grapes, which is required for lengthening somatic cell cycles 10-13. Mapping of the last S phase in pole cells and measurement of their DNA content indicate that pole cells become quiescent in G2 phase of the cell cycle. We were able to drive quiescent pole cells into mitosis by induction of either an activator of Cdc2 (Cdc25string phosphatase) or a mutant form of Cdc2 that cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation. In contrast, induction of wild-type Cdc2 with a mitotic cyclin did not induce mitosis in pole cells. We propose that inhibition of Cdc2 by phosphorylation contributes to G2 arrest in pole cells during embryogenesis. Furthermore, pole cells enter G1 following induced mitoses, indicating that entry into both mitosis and S phase is blocked in quiescent pole cells. These studies represent the first molecular characterization of proliferation in embryonic germ cells of Drosophila.",1998,"T T Su, S D Campbell, P H O'Farrell, T T Su, S D Campbell, P H O'Farrell"
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase in Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster,7526942,10.1111/j.1460-9568.1994.tb00327.x,"NADPH diaphorase (NADPHd) is a marker enzyme for nitric oxide (NO)-producing cells in vertebrates. This paper investigates the relationship between NADPHd and the NO-producing enzyme NO synthase (NOS) in neuronal tissue of Apis and Drosophila, two insects used for studying learning. First, the NOS and the NADPHd in both species were characterized biochemically. The fixation-insensitive NADPHd activity, which accounts for the staining in NADPHd histochemistry, co-purifies with the insect Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent NOS. Formation of NO from L-arginine depends on NADPH, and half-maximal stimulation is observed with 0.3 microM Ca2+. NOS is competitively inhibited by methyl-L-arginine and nitro-L-arginine, with Ki of 1.7 and 1.9 microM, respectively. The co-purification and the competitive inhibition of NOS by the NADPHd substrate, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), are proof that in insects the enzyme responsible for fixation-insensitive NADPHd activity is nitric oxide synthase. Second, the NOS activity was quantified in distinct neuropiles and the NO-producing neuropiles were visualized using NADPHd histochemistry. In both species the highest NOS activity is found in the chemosensory neuropiles of the antennal lobes, intermediate activity in the neuropiles of the central brain and by far the lowest NOS activity in the visual neuropiles. Although in both species the Kenyon cell somata of the mushroom bodies show no detectable staining, the neuropiles of the mushroom bodies of Drosophila and Apis show a distinct staining. The staining pattern of NOS in both species is different to that of all known neurotransmitters.",1994,"U Müller, U Müller"
The achaete-scute complex: generation of cellular pattern and fate within the Drosophila nervous system,8050670,10.1096/fasebj.8.10.8050670,"In developing embryos, cells receive and interpret positional information as they become organized into discrete patterns and structures. One excellent model for understanding the genetic regulatory mechanisms that pattern cellular fields is the regulation and function of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) in the developing nervous system of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Three structurally homologous proneural genes--achaete (ac), scute (sc), and lethal of scute (l'sc)--are required for neural stem cell formation. In Drosophila, the AS-C genes are initially expressed in patterns of cell clusters at reproducible anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) coordinates that foreshadow where neural precursors arise. In the embryonic central nervous system (CNS), the gene products of AP and DV axis-patterning genes act combinatorially via a large array of cis-regulatory regions scattered throughout the AS-C to generate a segmentally repeated pattern of proneural clusters. Within each cluster (an equivalence group), one cell then retains proneural gene expression and is singled out as the neural stem cell (neuroblast). The neuroblast inhibits the surrounding cells from adopting neural fates (lateral inhibition) through a signaling pathway that is mediated via the action of the proneural and neurogenic genes. The proneural genes therefore represent a nodal point in the patterning of the nervous system. They receive global positional information, transduce it to discrete sets of cells, and trigger local cell interactions that mediate cell fate decisions.",1994,"J B Skeath, S B Carroll, J B Skeath, S B Carroll"
Direct sequencing of terminal regions of genomic P1 clones. A general strategy for the design of sequence-tagged site markers,7710776,10.1016/1050-3862(94)90032-9,"A method for the preparation of P1 DNA is presented, which allows the direct sequencing of ends of inserts in genomic P1 clones using the Applied Biosystems 373A DNA Sequencer and the Dye Terminator sequencing methodology. We surveyed several common methods of DNA preparation including alkaline lysis, Triton-lysozyme lysis, CsCl density-gradient purification, and a commercial column matrix DNA purification kit manufactured by Qiagen. We found that a modified alkaline lysis preparation of P1 DNA was most successful for generating P1 DNA that could be sequenced directly. We also noted that the host bacterial strain from which the P1 DNA was purified dramatically affected the quality of sequencing templates. The bacterial strains NS3145 and NS3529, in which the Drosophila melanogaster and human P1 genomic libraries are harbored, routinely yielded poor-quality sequencing templates. However, the bacterial strain DH10B routinely yielded P1 DNA that was sequenced successfully. A bacterial mating scheme is presented that exploits gamma delta transposition events to allow the transfer of P1 clones from the library host strain to DH10B. Using either an SP6 or a T7 primer, an average of 350 base pairs of DNA sequence was obtained with an uncalled base frequency of approximately 2%. About 4% of P1 end sequences generated corresponded to unique Drosophila loci present in the Genbank database. These single-pass DNA sequences were used to design sequence-tagged site markers for physical mapping studies in both humans and Drosophila.",1994,"W J Kimmerly, A L Kyle, V M Lustre, C H Martin, M J Palazzolo, W J Kimmerly, A L Kyle, V M Lustre, C H Martin, M J Palazzolo"
Differential translatability of antifreeze protein mRNAs in a transgenic host,1730058,10.1016/0167-4781(92)90486-j,"The expression of fusion gene constructs containing Drosophila regulatory sequences and the structural portions of fish antifreeze protein genes have been examined by transfer into Drosophila melanogaster using P elements. A fusion gene, containing the enhancer, promoter, and cap site of the yolk polypeptide 1 gene, joined in the 5'-untranslated region to the structural portion of the winter flounder type I antifreeze gene, was transcribed in mature female transformants to give an mRNA of the predicted size, but no antifreeze protein was detected by Western blotting. When the same antifreeze protein gene was fused to a Drosophila hsp 70 gene regulatory region and placed downstream of the yolk polypeptide gene enhancer, appropriate expression of mRNA was directed by both gene regulatory elements. However, a translation product from this mRNA was only observed under heat shock conditions and was present at low levels. It is suggested that type I antifreeze mRNA, with its high content of alanine codons and their grouping into clusters of up to seven in a row, is poorly translated when in competition with other host mRNAs. In agreement with this hypothesis, a fusion gene construct between the yolk protein gene regulatory region and two type III antifreeze protein genes produced sub-mmolar concentrations of antifreeze protein in mature females from each of several transgenic lines analysed. The type III antifreeze protein does not have an imbalanced amino acid composition or sequence irregularities, and may be an appropriate choice for conferring freeze protection to frost-susceptible hosts by gene transfer.",1992,"D E Rancourt, P L Davies, V K Walker, D E Rancourt, P L Davies, V K Walker"
Upstream sequences of dosage-compensated and non-compensated alleles of the larval secretion protein gene Sgs-4 in Drosophila,3125018,10.1007/BF00285876,"The X chromosomal gene Sgs-4 coding for a larval secretion protein of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed stage and tissue specifically and is hyperexpressed in male larvae of most Drosophila stocks which show dosage compensation. We analysed three Sgs-4 alleles which differ in the size of their coding region, in the intensity of their expression and in the level of dosage compensation. The size and amount of Sgs-4 proteins directly reflect those of RNAs. Different RNA sizes result from different numbers of 21 bp repeats within the structural genes. We sequenced 2.8 kb of DNA upstream of the transcription initiation site of the three alleles. Sequences known to be essential for correct gene expression were located. The only difference within DNA sequences from -1 to -1200 between two alleles with different degrees of expression and differing in dosage compensation is a C to T transition at -344 within a supposed consensus sequence for ecdysone receptor complex binding (ECR). This mutation is partly located within a region of dyad symmetry. Alleles with identical expression show identical mutations within a GTT-rich region at -1.2 kb, but differ within a GT-rich region at -2.0 kb. A polyadenylated 0.5 kb RNA was found to be transcribed from the GTT-rich region of the strand opposite to that of Sgs-4.

Multiple actins in Drosophila melanogaster,113417,10.1083/jcb.82.1.86,"The tissue and developmental specificities of the three Drosophila isoactins, originally identified in primary myogenic cultures and in the permanent Schneider L-2 cell line, have been investigated. Of these three isoactins (I, II, and III), actins I and II are stable and actin III is unstable. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses of total cellular extracts after 1-h [(35)S]methionine pulses were performed on a large variety of embryonic, larval, and adult muscle and nonmuscle tissues. The results suggest that isoactins II and III are generalized cellular actins found in all drosophila cell types. Actin I, on the other hand, is muscle-associated and is found exclusively in supercontractile muscle (such as larval body wall and larval and adult viscera) including primary myogenic cell cultures. Although actin I synthesis is not detectable during very early embryogenesis, it is detectable by 25 h and actin I is a major stable actin in all larval muscle tissues. Actin I is synthesized in reduced amounts relative to the other actins in late third instar larvae but is again a major product of actin synthesis in the adult abdomen. A stable actin species with the same pI as actin III has been identified in the adult thorax and appears to be unique to flight muscle tissue. This new stable form of thoracic actin may be the result of a stabilization of the actin III found in other tissues or may be an entirely separate gene product.",1979,"S J Horovitch, R V Storti, A Rich, M L Pardue, S J Horovitch, R V Storti, A Rich, M L Pardue"
The pdm3 Locus Is a Hotspot for Recurrent Evolution of Female-Limited Color Dimorphism in Drosophila,27546577,10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.016,"Sex-limited polymorphisms are an intriguing form of sexual dimorphism that offer unique opportunities to reconstruct the evolutionary changes that decouple male and female traits encoded by a shared genome. We investigated the genetic basis of a Mendelian female-limited color dimorphism (FLCD) that segregates in natural populations of more than 20 species of the Drosophila montium subgroup. In these species, females have alternative abdominal color morphs, light and dark, whereas males have only one color morph in each species. A comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the montium subgroup supports multiple origins of FLCD. Despite this, we mapped FLCD to the same locus in four distantly related species-the transcription factor POU domain motif 3 (pdm3), which acts as a repressor of abdominal pigmentation in D. melanogaster. In D. serrata, FLCD maps to a structural variant in the first intron of pdm3; however, this variant is not found in the three other species-D. kikkawai, D. leontia, and D. burlai-and sequence analysis strongly suggests the pdm3 alleles responsible for FLCD originated independently at least three times. We propose that cis-regulatory changes in pdm3 form sexually dimorphic and monomorphic alleles that segregate within species and are preserved, at least in one species, by structural variation. Surprisingly, pdm3 has not been implicated in the evolution of sex-specific pigmentation outside the montium subgroup, suggesting that the genetic paths to sexual dimorphism may be constrained within a clade but variable across clades.",2016,"Amir Yassin, Emily K Delaney, Adam J Reddiex, Thaddeus D Seher, Héloïse Bastide, Nicholas C Appleton, Justin B Lack, Jean R David, Stephen F Chenoweth, John E Pool, Artyom Kopp, Amir Yassin, Emily K Delaney, Adam J Reddiex, Thaddeus D Seher, Héloïse Bastide, Nicholas C Appleton, Justin B Lack, Jean R David, Stephen F Chenoweth, John E Pool, Artyom Kopp"
"Dynamin-mediated endocytosis is required for tube closure, cell intercalation, and biased apical expansion during epithelial tubulogenesis in the Drosophila ovary",26542010,10.1016/j.ydbio.2015.10.034,"Most metazoans are able to grow beyond a few hundred cells and to support differentiated tissues because they elaborate multicellular, epithelial tubes that are indispensable for nutrient and gas exchange. To identify and characterize the cellular behaviors and molecular mechanisms required for the morphogenesis of epithelial tubes (i.e., tubulogenesis), we have turned to the D. melanogaster ovary. Here, epithelia surrounding the developing egg chambers first pattern, then form and extend a set of simple, paired, epithelial tubes, the dorsal appendage (DA) tubes, and they create these structures in the absence of cell division or cell death. This genetically tractable system lets us assess the relative contributions that coordinated changes in cell shape, adhesion, orientation, and migration make to basic epithelial tubulogenesis. We find that Dynamin, a conserved regulator of endocytosis and the cytoskeleton, serves a key role in DA tubulogenesis. We demonstrate that Dynamin is required for distinct aspects of DA tubulogenesis: DA-tube closure, DA-tube-cell intercalation, and biased apical-luminal cell expansion. We provide evidence that Dynamin promotes these processes by facilitating endocytosis of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion complexes, and we find that precise levels and sub-cellular distribution of E-Cadherin and specific Integrin subunits impact DA tubulogenesis. Thus, our studies identify novel morphogenetic roles (i.e., tube closure and biased apical expansion), and expand upon established roles (i.e., cell intercalation and adhesion remodeling), for Dynamin in tubulogenesis.",2016,"Nathaniel C Peters, Celeste A Berg, Nathaniel C Peters, Celeste A Berg"
Comparison of ultra-conserved elements in drosophilids and vertebrates,24349264,10.1371/journal.pone.0082362,"Metazoan genomes contain many ultra-conserved elements (UCEs), long sequences identical between distant species. In this study we identified UCEs in drosophilid and vertebrate species with a similar level of phylogenetic divergence measured at protein-coding regions, and demonstrated that both the length and number of UCEs are larger in vertebrates. The proportion of non-exonic UCEs declines in distant drosophilids whilst an opposite trend was observed in vertebrates. We generated a set of 2,126 Sophophora UCEs by merging elements identified in several drosophila species and compared these to the eutherian UCEs identified in placental mammals. In contrast to vertebrates, the Sophophora UCEs are depleted around transcription start sites. Analysis of 52,954 P-element, piggyBac and Minos insertions in the D. melanogaster genome revealed depletion of the P-element and piggyBac insertions in and around the Sophophora UCEs. We examined eleven fly strains with transposon insertions into the intergenic UCEs and identified associated phenotypes in five strains. Four insertions behave as recessive lethals, and in one case we observed a suppression of the marker gene within the transgene, presumably by silenced chromatin around the integration site. To confirm the lethality is caused by integration of transposons we performed a phenotype rescue experiment for two stocks and demonstrated that the excision of the transposons from the intergenic UCEs restores viability. Sequencing of DNA after the transposon excision in one fly strain with the restored viability revealed a 47 bp insertion at the original transposon integration site suggesting that the nature of the mutation is important for the appearance of the phenotype. Our results suggest that the UCEs in flies and vertebrates have both common and distinct features, and demonstrate that a significant proportion of intergenic drosophila UCEs are sensitive to disruption.",2013,"Igor V Makunin, Viktor V Shloma, Stuart J Stephen, Michael Pheasant, Stepan N Belyakin, Igor V Makunin, Viktor V Shloma, Stuart J Stephen, Michael Pheasant, Stepan N Belyakin"
"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting in the expression of the regulator of intestinal stem cell proliferation, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)",21593603,10.4161/rna.8.4.15395,"A programmed ribosomal frameshift (PRF) in the decoding of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) mRNA has been identified and characterized in Caenorhabditis worms, Drosophila and mosquitoes. The frameshift product lacks the C-terminal approximately one-third of the product of standard decoding and instead has a short sequence encoded by the -1 frame which is just 13 residues in C. elegans, but is 125 in D. melanogaster. The frameshift site is A_AA.A_AA.C in Caenorhabditids, fruit flies and the mosquitoes studied while a variant A_AA.A_AA.A is found in some other nematodes. The predicted secondary RNA structure of the downstream stimulators varies considerably in the species studied. In the twelve sequenced Drosophila genomes, it is a long stem with a four-way junction in its loop. In the five sequenced Caenorhabditis species, it is a short RNA pseudoknot with an additional stem in loop 1. The efficiency of frameshifting varies significantly, depending on the particular stimulator within the frameshift cassette, when tested with reporter constructs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Phylogenetic analysis of the distribution of APC programmed ribosomal frameshifting cassettes suggests it has an ancient origin and raises questions about a possibility of synthesis of alternative protein products during expression of APC in other organisms such as humans. The origin of APC as a PRF candidate emerged from a prior study of evolutionary signatures derived from comparative analysis of the 12 fly genomes.

Exquisite ligand stereoselectivity of a Drosophila juvenile hormone receptor contrasts with its broad agonist repertoire,30455350,10.1074/jbc.RA118.005992,"The sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) is vital to insect development and reproduction. Intracellular JH receptors have recently been established as basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (bHLH)/PAS proteins in Drosophila melanogaster known as germ cell-expressed (Gce) and its duplicate paralog, methoprene-tolerant (Met). Upon binding JH, Gce/Met activates its target genes. Insects possess multiple native JH homologs whose molecular activities remain unexplored, and diverse synthetic compounds including insecticides exert JH-like effects. How the JH receptor recognizes its ligands is unknown. To determine which structural features define an active JH receptor agonist, we tested several native JHs and their nonnative geometric and optical isomers for the ability to bind the Drosophila JH receptor Gce, to induce Gce-dependent transcription, and to affect the development of the fly. Our results revealed high ligand stereoselectivity of the receptor. The geometry of the JH skeleton, dictated by two stereogenic double bonds, was the most critical feature followed by the presence of an epoxide moiety at a terminal position. The optical isomerism at carbon C11 proved less important even though Gce preferentially bound a natural JH enantiomer. The results of receptor-ligand-binding and cell-based gene activation assays tightly correlated with the ability of different geometric JH isomers to induce gene expression and morphogenetic effects in the developing insects. Molecular modeling supported the requirement for the proper double-bond geometry of JH, which appears to be its major selective mechanism.

Drosophila RSK Influences the Pace of the Circadian Clock by Negative Regulation of Protein Kinase Shaggy Activity,29706866,10.3389/fnmol.2018.00122,"Endogenous molecular circadian clocks drive daily rhythmic changes at the cellular, physiological, and behavioral level for adaptation to and anticipation of environmental signals. The core molecular system consists of autoregulatory feedback loops, where clock proteins inhibit their own transcription. A complex and not fully understood interplay of regulatory proteins influences activity, localization and stability of clock proteins to set the pace of the clock. This study focuses on the molecular function of Ribosomal S6 Kinase (RSK) in the Drosophila melanogaster circadian clock. Mutations in the human rsk2 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome, which is associated with severe mental disabilities. Knock-out studies with Drosophila ortholog rsk uncovered functions in synaptic processes, axonal transport and adult behavior including associative learning and circadian activity. However, the molecular targets of RSK remain elusive. Our experiments provide evidence that RSK acts in the key pace maker neurons as a negative regulator of Shaggy (SGG) kinase activity, which in turn determines timely nuclear entry of the clock proteins Period and Timeless to close the negative feedback loop. Phosphorylation of serine 9 in SGG is mediated by the C-terminal kinase domain of RSK, which is in agreement with previous genetic studies of RSK in the circadian clock but argues against the prevailing view that only the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK proteins carries the effector function. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation how RSK influences the molecular clock and imply SGG S9 phosphorylation by RSK and other kinases as a convergence point for diverse cellular and external stimuli.",2018,"Katherina Beck, Anna Hovhanyan, Pamela Menegazzi, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Thomas Raabe, Katherina Beck, Anna Hovhanyan, Pamela Menegazzi, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Thomas Raabe"
Novel Organelles with Elements of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Secretion Systems Weaponize Parasites of Drosophila,28889977,10.1016/j.cub.2017.08.019,"The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in conflict with those of their hosts [1]. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos [2-5]. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to wasps' successful parasitism of Drosophila [6], but the composition of VLPs and their biotic nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (1) the eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (2) immunity, and (3) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface and spike-tip protein, p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD and IpaD of Gram-negative bacterial type-3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells.

A comparison of nucleosome organization in Drosophila cell lines,28570602,10.1371/journal.pone.0178590,"Changes in the distribution of nucleosomes along the genome influence chromatin structure and impact gene expression by modulating the accessibility of DNA to transcriptional machinery. However, the role of genome-wide nucleosome positioning in gene expression and in maintaining differentiated cell states remains poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster cell lines represent distinct tissue types and exhibit cell-type specific gene expression profiles. They thus could provide a useful tool for investigating cell-type specific nucleosome organization of an organism's genome. To evaluate this possibility, we compared genome-wide nucleosome positioning and occupancy in five different Drosophila tissue-specific cell lines, and in reconstituted chromatin, and then tested for correlations between nucleosome positioning, transcription factor binding motifs, and gene expression. Nucleosomes in all cell lines were positioned in accordance with previously known DNA-nucleosome interactions, with helically repeating A/T di-nucleotide pairs arranged within nucleosomal DNAs and AT-rich pentamers generally excluded from nucleosomal DNA. Nucleosome organization in all cell lines differed markedly from in vitro reconstituted chromatin, with highly expressed genes showing strong nucleosome organization around transcriptional start sites. Importantly, comparative analysis identified genomic regions that exhibited cell line-specific nucleosome enrichment or depletion. Further analysis of these regions identified 91 out of 16,384 possible heptamer sequences that showed differential nucleosomal occupation between cell lines, and 49 of the heptamers matched one or more known transcription factor binding sites.

Metabolomic and Gene Expression Profiles Exhibit Modular Genetic and Dietary Structure Linking Metabolic Syndrome Phenotypes in Drosophila,26530416,10.1534/g3.115.023564,"Genetic and environmental factors influence complex disease in humans, such as metabolic syndrome, and Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model in which to test these factors experimentally. Here we explore the modularity of endophenotypes with an in-depth reanalysis of a previous study by Reed et al. (2014), where we raised 20 wild-type genetic lines of Drosophila larvae on four diets and measured gross phenotypes of body weight, total sugar, and total triglycerides, as well as the endophenotypes of metabolomic and whole-genome expression profiles. We then perform new gene expression experiments to test for conservation of phenotype-expression correlations across different diets and populations. We find that transcript levels correlated with gross phenotypes were enriched for puparial adhesion, metamorphosis, and central energy metabolism functions. The specific metabolites L-DOPA and N-arachidonoyl dopamine make physiological links between the gross phenotypes across diets, whereas leucine and isoleucine thus exhibit genotype-by-diet interactions. Between diets, we find low conservation of the endophenotypes that correlate with the gross phenotypes. Through the follow-up expression study, we found that transcript-trait correlations are well conserved across populations raised on a familiar diet, but on a novel diet, the transcript-trait correlations are no longer conserved. Thus, physiological canalization of metabolic phenotypes breaks down in a novel environment exposing cryptic variation. We cannot predict the physiological basis of disease in a perturbing environment from profiles observed in the ancestral environment.

Manipulations of amyloid precursor protein cleavage disrupt the circadian clock in aging Drosophila,25766673,10.1016/j.nbd.2015.02.012,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe cognitive deterioration. While causes of AD pathology are debated, a large body of evidence suggests that increased cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) producing the neurotoxic Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide plays a fundamental role in AD pathogenesis. One of the detrimental behavioral symptoms commonly associated with AD is the fragmentation of sleep-activity cycles with increased nighttime activity and daytime naps in humans. Sleep-activity cycles, as well as physiological and cellular rhythms, which may be important for neuronal homeostasis, are generated by a molecular system known as the circadian clock. Links between AD and the circadian system are increasingly evident but not well understood. Here we examined whether genetic manipulations of APP-like (APPL) protein cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster affect rest-activity rhythms and core circadian clock function in this model organism. We show that the increased β-cleavage of endogenous APPL by the β-secretase (dBACE) severely disrupts circadian behavior and leads to reduced expression of clock protein PER in central clock neurons of aging flies. Our data suggest that behavioral rhythm disruption is not a product of APPL-derived Aβ production but rather may be caused by a mechanism common to both α and β-cleavage pathways. Specifically, we show that increased production of the endogenous Drosophila Amyloid Intracellular Domain (dAICD) caused disruption of circadian rest-activity rhythms, while flies overexpressing endogenous APPL maintained stronger circadian rhythms during aging. In summary, our study offers a novel entry point toward understanding the mechanism of circadian rhythm disruption in Alzheimer's disease.",2015,"Matthew R Blake, Scott D Holbrook, Joanna Kotwica-Rolinska, Eileen S Chow, Doris Kretzschmar, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz, Matthew R Blake, Scott D Holbrook, Joanna Kotwica-Rolinska, Eileen S Chow, Doris Kretzschmar, Jadwiga M Giebultowicz"
Abundance and distribution of transposable elements in two Drosophila QTL mapping resources,23883524,10.1093/molbev/mst129,"Here we present computational machinery to efficiently and accurately identify transposable element (TE) insertions in 146 next-generation sequenced inbred strains of Drosophila melanogaster. The panel of lines we use in our study is composed of strains from a pair of genetic mapping resources: the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR). We identified 23,087 TE insertions in these lines, of which 83.3% are found in only one line. There are marked differences in the distribution of elements over the genome, with TEs found at higher densities on the X chromosome, and in regions of low recombination. We also identified many more TEs per base pair of intronic sequence and fewer TEs per base pair of exonic sequence than expected if TEs are located at random locations in the euchromatic genome. There was substantial variation in TE load across genes. For example, the paralogs derailed and derailed-2 show a significant difference in the number of TE insertions, potentially reflecting differences in the selection acting on these loci. When considering TE families, we find a very weak effect of gene family size on TE insertions per gene, indicating that as gene family size increases the number of TE insertions in a given gene within that family also increases. TEs are known to be associated with certain phenotypes, and our data will allow investigators using the DGRP and DSPR to assess the functional role of TE insertions in complex trait variation more generally. Notably, because most TEs are very rare and often private to a single line, causative TEs resulting in phenotypic differences among individuals may typically fail to replicate across mapping panels since individual elements are unlikely to segregate in both panels. Our data suggest that ""burden tests"" that test for the effect of TEs as a class may be more fruitful.",2013,"Julie M Cridland, Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long, Kevin R Thornton, Julie M Cridland, Stuart J Macdonald, Anthony D Long, Kevin R Thornton"
Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight,21264297,10.1371/journal.pone.0015361,"Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust.

"Quantitative evaluation of benzene, toluene, and xylene in the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster by solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for potential use in toxicological studies",21140672,,"A simple, rapid, and solvent-free method for quantitative determination of benzene, toluene, and Xylene in exposed Drosophila larvae was developed using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to GC/MS. Larvae fed on standard Drosophila food mixed with benzene, toluene, and Xylene for 48 h were homogenized in Milli-Q water. Extraction of benzene, toluene, and Xylene was performed at 65 degrees C for 30 min on the SPME fiber (silica-fused). Subsequently, the fiber was desorbed in the GC injection port, followed by GC/MS analysis in the selected-ion monitoring mode. An external calibration curve was used for the quantification of benzene, toluene, and Xylene in the exposed organism. Recoveries were in the range of 78-82% (intraday) and 76-81% (interday) in larvae, and 91-96% (intraday) and 87-92% (interday) in the diet. LOD with an S/N of 3:1 and LOQ with an S/N of 10:1 were in the range of 0.01-0.023 and 0.034-0.077 microg/L, respectively.

CTCF-dependent chromatin boundary element between the latency-associated transcript and ICP0 promoters in the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome,17267480,10.1128/JVI.02447-06,"Cells latently infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV) contain nucleosomal DNA similar to that of host cell chromatin. Recent studies have demonstrated that histones in the latency-associated transcript (LAT) promoter and intron regions contain histone modifications permissive for transcription. However, those histones associated with the lytic-specific ICP0 gene, which lies only 5 kb away, contain modifications typical of silenced chromatin. How this active chromatin is kept separate from the repressed chromatin in the nearby ICP0 region remains crucial to the understanding of the HSV lytic cycle. In this study, we show that the LAT intron region contains an insulator. Specifically, we show that an 800-bp region from the LAT intron can block enhancers in both tissue culture cells and Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Importantly, the 800-bp HSV insulator protects a LAT transgene from positional effects in Drosophila eye tissue. The 800-bp region contains nine copies of 16-bp repeats. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that CTCF interacts with the CTCCC sequence within the repeats. In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that CTCF interacts with these repeats in latently infected trigeminal ganglion neurons. The deletion of these repeats impaired insulator activity in human K562 cells and Drosophila embryos. Finally, double-spaced RNA knockdown of CTCF disrupts enhancer-blocking activity of the LAT insulator in transfected Drosophila S3 cells. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the 800-bp DNA in the LAT intron region works as a chromatin boundary during latency to separate active chromatin associated with the LAT promoter region from repressed chromatin in the ICP0 gene.",2007,"Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou, Qi Chen, Lan Lin, Sheryl Smith, Jing Huang, Shelley L Berger, Jumin Zhou"
Muscle development in the four-winged Drosophila and the role of the Ultrabithorax gene,7874495,10.1016/s0960-9822(00)00219-0,"Background:
      
    

    
      In the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, segment identity is specified by the homoeotic selector genes of the bithorax and Antennapedia complexes. The functions of these genes in the segmental specification of the Drosophila ectoderm have been well studied, but their roles in muscle development have been relatively poorly investigated. Recent experiments have strongly suggested that homeotic selector genes are directly involved in one aspect of mesodermal patterning during Drosophila embryogenesis. But muscle development is a complex process, requiring for its completion the correct positioning of the epidermis, the nervous system and the developing muscles in a segment-specific manner. Many aspects of homeotic selector gene function in this process remain to be understood.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In flies that are homozygous for three mutant alleles (anterobithorax, bithorax3, postbithorax) of the Ultrabithorax gene, the third thoracic segment (T3) is transformed towards the second (T2). The adults have two pairs of wings, but the homeotically transformed T3 (HT3) has only rudimentary indirect flight muscles. We used the 'four-winged' fly to study the role of homeotic selector genes in the development of the indirect flight muscles, which we classify into four 'events'. First, the determination of the segment-specific pattern of myoblasts in the larval thorax; second, the specific pattern of migration of myoblasts during metamorphosis; third, the fusion of myoblasts to form adult indirect flight muscles and fourth, the development of the branching pattern of adult motor innervation. Our study shows that the segmental identity of the epidermis determines the segment-specific pattern and number of myoblasts on the larval discs, and the pattern of their migration during metamorphosis. The segmental identity of the mesoderm, however, is crucial for the fusion of myoblasts to form indirect flight muscles, and also influences the branching pattern of innervation of indirect flight muscles.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Segmental information expressed in the ectoderm, and the autonomous function of homeotic selector genes in the mesoderm, are both required for the complete development of indirect flight muscles.",1994,"J Fernandes, S E Celniker, E B Lewis, K VijayRaghavan, J Fernandes, S E Celniker, E B Lewis, K VijayRaghavan"
The transcription factor odd-paired regulates temporal identity in transit-amplifying neural progenitors via an incoherent feed-forward loop,31329099,10.7554/eLife.46566,"Neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning to generate diverse neurons in a chronological order. This process is well-studied in the developing Drosophila brain and conserved in mammals. During larval stages, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) serially express Dichaete (D), grainyhead (Grh) and eyeless (Ey/Pax6), but how the transitions are regulated is not precisely understood. Here, we developed a method to isolate transcriptomes of INPs in their distinct temporal states to identify a complete set of temporal patterning factors. Our analysis identifies odd-paired (opa), as a key regulator of temporal patterning. Temporal patterning is initiated when the SWI/SNF complex component Osa induces D and its repressor Opa at the same time but with distinct kinetics. Then, high Opa levels repress D to allow Grh transcription and progress to the next temporal state. We propose that Osa and its target genes opa and D form an incoherent feedforward loop (FFL) and a new mechanism allowing the successive expression of temporal identities.",2019,"Merve Deniz Abdusselamoglu, Elif Eroglu, Thomas R Burkard, Jürgen A Knoblich, Merve Deniz Abdusselamoglu, Elif Eroglu, Thomas R Burkard, Jürgen A Knoblich"
Stereotyped terminal axon branching of leg motor neurons mediated by IgSF proteins DIP-α and Dpr10,30714901,10.7554/eLife.42692,"For animals to perform coordinated movements requires the precise organization of neural circuits controlling motor function. Motor neurons (MNs), key components of these circuits, project their axons from the central nervous system and form precise terminal branching patterns at specific muscles. Focusing on the Drosophila leg neuromuscular system, we show that the stereotyped terminal branching of a subset of MNs is mediated by interacting transmembrane Ig superfamily proteins DIP-α and Dpr10, present in MNs and target muscles, respectively. The DIP-α/Dpr10 interaction is needed only after MN axons reach the vicinity of their muscle targets. Live imaging suggests that precise terminal branching patterns are gradually established by DIP-α/Dpr10-dependent interactions between fine axon filopodia and developing muscles. Further, different leg MNs depend on the DIP-α and Dpr10 interaction to varying degrees that correlate with the morphological complexity of the MNs and their muscle targets.",2019,"Lalanti Venkatasubramanian, Zhenhao Guo, Shuwa Xu, Liming Tan, Qi Xiao, Sonal Nagarkar-Jaiswal, Richard S Mann, Lalanti Venkatasubramanian, Zhenhao Guo, Shuwa Xu, Liming Tan, Qi Xiao, Sonal Nagarkar-Jaiswal, Richard S Mann"
MDN brain descending neurons coordinately activate backward and inhibit forward locomotion,30070205,10.7554/eLife.38554,"Command-like descending neurons can induce many behaviors, such as backward locomotion, escape, feeding, courtship, egg-laying, or grooming (we define 'command-like neuron' as a neuron whose activation elicits or 'commands' a specific behavior). In most animals, it remains unknown how neural circuits switch between antagonistic behaviors: via top-down activation/inhibition of antagonistic circuits or via reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic circuits. Here, we use genetic screens, intersectional genetics, circuit reconstruction by electron microscopy, and functional optogenetics to identify a bilateral pair of Drosophila larval 'mooncrawler descending neurons' (MDNs) with command-like ability to coordinately induce backward locomotion and block forward locomotion; the former by stimulating a backward-active premotor neuron, and the latter by disynaptic inhibition of a forward-specific premotor neuron. In contrast, direct monosynaptic reciprocal inhibition between forward and backward circuits was not observed. Thus, MDNs coordinate a transition between antagonistic larval locomotor behaviors. Interestingly, larval MDNs persist into adulthood, where they can trigger backward walking. Thus, MDNs induce backward locomotion in both limbless and limbed animals.",2018,"Arnaldo Carreira-Rosario, Aref Arzan Zarin, Matthew Q Clark, Laurina Manning, Richard D Fetter, Albert Cardona, Chris Q Doe, Arnaldo Carreira-Rosario, Aref Arzan Zarin, Matthew Q Clark, Laurina Manning, Richard D Fetter, Albert Cardona, Chris Q Doe"
Adaptation to constant light requires Fic-mediated AMPylation of BiP to protect against reversible photoreceptor degeneration,30015618,10.7554/eLife.38752,"In response to environmental, developmental, and pathological stressors, cells engage homeostatic pathways to maintain their function. Among these pathways, the Unfolded Protein Response protects cells from the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Depending on ER stress levels, the ER-resident Fic protein catalyzes AMPylation or de-AMPylation of BiP, the major ER chaperone and regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. This work elucidates the importance of the reversible AMPylation of BiP in maintaining the Drosophila visual system in response to stress. After 72 hr of constant light, photoreceptors of fic-null and AMPylation-resistant BiPT366A mutants, but not wild-type flies, display loss of synaptic function, disintegration of rhabdomeres, and excessive activation of ER stress reporters. Strikingly, this phenotype is reversible: photoreceptors regain their structure and function within 72 hr once returned to a standard light:dark cycle.

We show that dPARP16 catalytic activity is necessary and sufficient for both amino-acid starvation induced mono-ADP-ribosylation and subsequent Sec body formation and cell survival. Importantly, dPARP16 catalyses the modification of Sec16, a key Sec body component, and we show that it is a critical event for the formation of this stress assembly.

In this context, we find that Tau displays a strong functional overlap with microtubule-binding spectraplakins, establishing new links between two different neurodegenerative factors. Tau and the spectraplakin Short Stop act upstream of a three-step regulatory cascade ensuring adequate delivery of synaptic proteins. This cascade involves microtubule stability as the initial trigger, JNK signalling as the central mediator, and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport as the key effector. This cascade acts during development (synapse formation) and ageing (synapse maintenance) alike.

Dynamics and heterogeneity of a fate determinant during transition towards cell differentiation,26583752,10.7554/eLife.08924,"Yan is an ETS-domain transcription factor responsible for maintaining Drosophila eye cells in a multipotent state. Yan is at the core of a regulatory network that determines the time and place in which cells transit from multipotency to one of several differentiated lineages. Using a fluorescent reporter for Yan expression, we observed a biphasic distribution of Yan in multipotent cells, with a rapid inductive phase and slow decay phase. Transitions to various differentiated states occurred over the course of this dynamic process, suggesting that Yan expression level does not strongly determine cell potential. Consistent with this conclusion, perturbing Yan expression by varying gene dosage had no effect on cell fate transitions. However, we observed that as cells transited to differentiation, Yan expression became highly heterogeneous and this heterogeneity was transient. Signals received via the EGF Receptor were necessary for the transience in Yan noise since genetic loss caused sustained noise. Since these signals are essential for eye cells to differentiate, we suggest that dynamic heterogeneity of Yan is a necessary element of the transition process, and cell states are stabilized through noise reduction.",2015,"Nicolás Peláez, Arnau Gavalda-Miralles, Bao Wang, Heliodoro Tejedor Navarro, Herman Gudjonson, Ilaria Rebay, Aaron R Dinner, Aggelos K Katsaggelos, Luís A N Amaral, Richard W Carthew, Nicolás Peláez, Arnau Gavalda-Miralles, Bao Wang, Heliodoro Tejedor Navarro, Herman Gudjonson, Ilaria Rebay, Aaron R Dinner, Aggelos K Katsaggelos, Luís A N Amaral, Richard W Carthew"

Like Yki, Ncoa6 and Trr are functionally required for Hippo-mediated growth control and target gene expression. Strikingly, artificial tethering of Ncoa6 to Sd is sufficient to promote tissue growth and Yki target expression even in the absence of Yki, underscoring the importance of Yki-mediated recruitment of Ncoa6 in transcriptional activation.

Quantification of Macronutrients Intake in a Thermogenetic Neuronal Screen using Drosophila Larvae,32597845,10.3791/61323,"Foraging and feeding behaviors allow animals to access sources of energy and nutrients essential for their development, health, and fitness. Investigating the neuronal regulation of these behaviors is essential for the understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying nutritional homeostasis. The use of genetically tractable animal models such as worms, flies, and fish greatly facilitates these types of studies. In the last decade, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a powerful animal model by neurobiologists investigating the neuronal control of feeding and foraging behaviors. While undoubtedly valuable, most studies examine adult flies. Here, we describe a protocol that takes advantage of the simpler larval nervous system to investigate neuronal substrates controlling feeding behaviors when larvae are exposed to diets differing in their protein and carbohydrates content. Our methods are based on a quantitative colorimetric no-choice feeding assay, performed in the context of a neuronal thermogenetic-activation screen. As a read-out, the amount of food eaten by larvae over a 1 h interval was used when exposed to one of the three dye-labeled diets that differ in their protein to carbohydrates (P:C) ratios. The efficacy of this protocol is demonstrated in the context of a neurogenetic screen in larval Drosophila, by identifying candidate neuronal populations regulating the amount of food eaten in diets of different macronutrient quality.

Norpa Signalling and the Seasonal Circadian Locomotor Phenotype in Drosophila,32560221,10.3390/biology9060130,"In this paper, we review the role of the norpA-encoded phospholipase C in light and thermal entrainment of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster. We extend our discussion to the role of norpA in the thermo-sensitive splicing of the per 3' UTR, which has significant implications for seasonal adaptations of circadian behaviour. We use the norpA mutant-generated enhancement of per splicing and the corresponding advance that it produces in the morning (M) and evening (E) locomotor component to dissect out the neurons that are contributing to this norpA phenotype using GAL4/UAS. We initially confirmed, by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridisation in adult brains, that norpA expression is mostly concentrated in the eyes, but we were unable to unequivocally reveal norpA expression in the canonical clock cells using these methods. In larval brains, we did see some evidence for co-expression of NORPA with PDF in clock neurons. Nevertheless, downregulation of norpA in clock neurons did generate behavioural advances in adults, with the eyes playing a significant role in the norpA seasonal phenotype at high temperatures, whereas the more dorsally located CRYPTOCHROME-positive clock neurons are the likely candidates for generating the norpA behavioural effects in the cold. We further show that knockdown of the related plc21C encoded phospholipase in clock neurons does not alter per splicing nor generate any of the behavioural advances seen with norpA. Our results with downregulating norpA and plc21C implicate the rhodopsins Rh2/Rh3/Rh4 in the eyes as mediating per 3' UTR splicing at higher temperatures and indicate that the CRY-positive LNds, also known as 'evening' cells are likely mediating the low-temperature seasonal effects on behaviour via altering per 3'UTR splicing.",2020,"Carlo Breda, Ezio Rosato, Charalambos P Kyriacou, Carlo Breda, Ezio Rosato, Charalambos P Kyriacou"
Ras acts as a molecular switch between two forms of consolidated memory in Drosophila,31932418,10.1073/pnas.1819925117,"Long-lasting, consolidated memories require not only positive biological processes that facilitate long-term memories (LTM) but also the suppression of inhibitory processes that prevent them. The mushroom body neurons (MBn) in Drosophila melanogaster store protein synthesis-dependent LTM (PSD-LTM) as well as protein synthesis-independent, anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). The formation of ARM inhibits PSD-LTM but the underlying molecular processes that mediate this interaction remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Ras→Raf→rho kinase (ROCK) pathway in MBn suppresses ARM consolidation, allowing the formation of PSD-LTM. Our initial results revealed that the effects of Ras on memory are due to postacquisition processes. Ras knockdown enhanced memory expression but had no effect on acquisition. Additionally, increasing Ras activity optogenetically after, but not before, acquisition impaired memory performance. The elevated memory produced by Ras knockdown is a result of increased ARM. While Ras knockdown enhanced the consolidation of ARM, it eliminated PSD-LTM. We found that these effects are mediated by the downstream kinase Raf. Similar to Ras, knockdown of Raf enhanced ARM consolidation and impaired PSD-LTM. Surprisingly, knockdown of the canonical downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase did not reproduce the phenotypes observed with Ras and Raf knockdown. Rather, Ras/Raf inhibition of ROCK was found to be responsible for suppressing ARM.

Growth control in the Drosophila wing disk,31917525,10.1002/wsbm.1478,"The regulation of size and shape is a fundamental requirement of biological development and has been a subject of scientific study for centuries, but we still lack an understanding of how organisms know when to stop growing. Imaginal wing disks of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which are precursors of the adult wings, are an archetypal tissue for studying growth control. The growth of the disks is dependent on many inter- and intra-organ factors such as morphogens, mechanical forces, nutrient levels, and hormones that influence gene expression and cell growth. Extracellular signals are transduced into gene-control signals via complex signal transduction networks, and since cells typically receive many different signals, a mechanism for integrating the signals is needed. Our understanding of the effect of morphogens on tissue-level growth regulation via individual pathways has increased significantly in the last half century, but our understanding of how multiple biochemical and mechanical signals are integrated to determine whether or not a cell decides to divide is still rudimentary. Numerous fundamental questions are involved in understanding the decision-making process, and here we review the major biochemical and mechanical pathways involved in disk development with a view toward providing a basis for beginning to understand how multiple signals can be integrated at the cell level, and how this translates into growth control at the level of the imaginal disk.

A distinctive sequence motif in the fourth transmembrane domain confers ZIP13 iron function in Drosophila melanogaster,31733261,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.118607,"The zinc/iron permease (ZIP/SLC39A) family plays an important role in metal ion transport and is essential for diverse physiological processes. Members of the ZIP family function primarily in the influx of transition metal ions zinc and iron, into cytoplasm from extracellular space or intracellular organelles. The molecular determinants defining metal ion selectivity among ZIP family members remain unclear. Specifically, we reported before that the Drosophila ZIP family member ZIP13 (dZIP13), functions as an iron exporter and was responsible for pumping iron into the secretory pathway. ZIP13 protein is unique in that it differs from the other LIV-1 subfamily members at transmembrane domain IV (TM4), wherein relative positions of the conserved H and D residues in the HNXXD sequence motif are switched, generating a DNXXH motif. In this study, we undertook an in vivo approach to explore the significance of this D/H exchange. Comparative functional analysis of mutants revealed that the relative positions of D and H are critical for the physiological roles of dZIP13 and its close homologue dZIP7. Swapping D/H position of this DNXXH sequence in dZIP13 resulted in loss of iron activity; normal dZIP13 could not complement dZIP7 loss, but swapping the two relative amino acid positions D and H in dZIP13 was sufficient to make it functionally analogous to its close homologue dZIP7. This work provides the first in vivo functional analysis of a structural motif required to differentiate different transporting functions of ZIPs.",2020,"Mengran Zhao, Bing Zhou, Mengran Zhao, Bing Zhou"
Macronutrients modulate survival to infection and immunity in Drosophila,31658371,10.1111/1365-2656.13126,"Immunity and nutrition are two essential modulators of individual fitness. However, while the implications of immune function and nutrition on an individual's lifespan and reproduction are well established, the interplay between feeding behaviour, infection and immune function remains poorly understood. Asking how ecological and physiological factors affect immune responses and resistance to infections is a central theme of eco-immunology. In this study, we used the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate how infection through septic injury modulates nutritional intake and how macronutrient balance affects survival to infection by the pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus. Our results show that infected flies maintain carbohydrate intake, but reduce protein intake, thereby shifting from a protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio of ~1:4 to ~1:10 relative to non-infected and sham-infected flies. Strikingly, the proportion of flies dying after M. luteus infection was significantly lower when flies were fed a low-P high-C diet, revealing that flies shift their macronutrient intake as means of nutritional self-medication against bacterial infection. These results are likely due to the effects of the macronutrient balance on the regulation of the constitutive expression of innate immune genes, as a low-P high-C diet was linked to an upregulation in the expression of key antimicrobial peptides. Together, our results reveal the intricate relationship between macronutrient intake and resistance to infection and integrate the molecular cross-talk between metabolic and immune pathways into the framework of nutritional immunology.",2020,"Fleur Ponton, Juliano Morimoto, Katie Robinson, Sheemal S Kumar, Sheena C Cotter, Kenneth Wilson, Stephen J Simpson, Fleur Ponton, Juliano Morimoto, Katie Robinson, Sheemal S Kumar, Sheena C Cotter, Kenneth Wilson, Stephen J Simpson"
DDX3X and specific initiation factors modulate FMR1 repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation,31347257,10.15252/embr.201847498,"A CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 causes the neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). This repeat supports a non-canonical mode of protein synthesis known as repeat-associated, non-AUG (RAN) translation. The mechanism underlying RAN translation at CGG repeats remains unclear. To identify modifiers of RAN translation and potential therapeutic targets, we performed a candidate-based screen of eukaryotic initiation factors and RNA helicases in cell-based assays and a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS. We identified multiple modifiers of toxicity and RAN translation from an expanded CGG repeat in the context of the FMR1 5'UTR. These include the DEAD-box RNA helicase belle/DDX3X, the helicase accessory factors EIF4B/4H, and the start codon selectivity factors EIF1 and EIF5. Disrupting belle/DDX3X selectively inhibited FMR1 RAN translation in Drosophila in vivo and cultured human cells, and mitigated repeat-induced toxicity in Drosophila and primary rodent neurons. These findings implicate RNA secondary structure and start codon fidelity as critical elements mediating FMR1 RAN translation and identify potential targets for treating repeat-associated neurodegeneration.",2019,"Alexander E Linsalata, Fang He, Ahmed M Malik, Mary Rebecca Glineburg, Katelyn M Green, Sam Natla, Brittany N Flores, Amy Krans, Hilary C Archbold, Stephen J Fedak, Sami J Barmada, Peter K Todd, Alexander E Linsalata, Fang He, Ahmed M Malik, Mary Rebecca Glineburg, Katelyn M Green, Sam Natla, Brittany N Flores, Amy Krans, Hilary C Archbold, Stephen J Fedak, Sami J Barmada, Peter K Todd"
Flexible manipulation of Omb levels in the endogenous expression region of Drosophila wing by combinational overexpression and suppression strategy,31246335,10.1111/1744-7917.12705,"Manipulating an exogenous or endogenous gene of interest at a defined level is critical for a wide variety of experiments. The Gal4/UAS system has been widely used to direct gene expression for studying complex genetic and biological problems in Drosophila melanogaster and other model organisms. Driven by a given tissue-specific Gal4, expressing UAS-transgene or UAS-RNAi (RNA interference) could be used to up- or down-regulate target gene expression, respectively. However, the efficiency of the Gal4/UAS system is roughly predefined by properties of transposon vector constructs and the insertion site in the transgenic stock. Here, we describe a simple way to modulate optomotor blind (omb) expression levels in its endogenous expression region of the wing disc. We co-expressed UAS-omb and UAS-omb-RNAi together under the control of dpp-Gal4 driver which is expressed in the omb expression region of the wing pouch. The repression effect is more sensitive to temperature than that of overexpression. At low temperature, overexpression plays a dominant role but the efficiency is attenuated by UAS-omb-RNAi. In contrast, at high temperature RNAi predominates in gene expression regulation. By this strategy, we could manipulate omb expression levels at a moderate level. It allows us to manipulate omb expression levels in the same tissue between overexpression and repression at different stages by temperature control.",2020,"Xu-Bo Zhang, Wei Dong, Kai-Xia Li, Juan-Juan Wang, Jie Shen, Bernard Moussian, Jian-Zhen Zhang, Xu-Bo Zhang, Wei Dong, Kai-Xia Li, Juan-Juan Wang, Jie Shen, Bernard Moussian, Jian-Zhen Zhang"
Morphogenetic movements affect local tissue organisation during embryonic Drosophila morphogenesis,29573831,10.1016/j.ejcb.2018.03.004,"Tissues and organs undergo extensive remodelling to reach their final morphology and physiological activity. The genetic programs underlying tissue formation are well studied, but less is known about how this formation is influenced by extrinsic forces derived from other concomitant morphogenetic events. Here we address this question in Drosophila melanogaster. We analyse tissue organisation in the embryonic epidermis at stage 10 by computational tissue segmentation methods to provide a quantitative description of packing. We find that the epidermis adopts different organisations along the dorso-ventral axis that correlate with differences in cell density. We analyse the contribution of three morphogenetic events that take place right before or concomitant to this period of embryogenesis, neuroblast delamination, asynchronous postblastoderm cell divisions and germ band extension, and we find that they all exert an influence on the packing of the epidermis. We previously described that the apical determinant Crumbs accumulates differentially in the epidermis along the dorso-ventral axis. Here we find that this differential accumulation of Crumbs correlates with the differential tissue packing. Perturbation of the three mentioned morphogenetic events also modulate Crumbs differential accumulation, suggesting that Crb could act as a read-out of tissue organisation. We also previously showed that Crb plays a role in regulating cell architecture. Now we find that it is also required for proper packing of the embryonic epidermis. In summary, here we uncover an intimate relationship between morphogenetic events and cell packing within a tissue that is dependent on surrounding cell density. Furthermore we find that this morphogenetically-regulated tissue packing modulates the key cell polarity protein Crumbs, which in turn is required for tissue packing, suggesting that it may participate in the molecular mechanism/s underlying the described tissue organisation.",2018,"Annalisa Letizia, Sebastien Tosi, Marta Llimargas, Annalisa Letizia, Sebastien Tosi, Marta Llimargas"
Desiccation resistance: effect of cuticular hydrocarbons and water content in Drosophila melanogaster adults,29456884,10.7717/peerj.4318,"Background:
      
    

    
      The insect cuticle covers the whole body and all appendages and has bi-directionnal selective permeability: it protects against environmental stress and pathogen infection and also helps to reduce water loss. The adult cuticle is often associated with a superficial layer of fatty acid-derived molecules such as waxes and long chain hydrocarbons that prevent rapid dehydration. The waterproofing properties of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHs) depend on their chain length and desaturation number. Drosophila CH biosynthesis involves an enzymatic pathway including several elongase and desaturase enzymes.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      The link between desiccation resistance and CH profile remains unclear, so we tested (1) experimentally selected desiccation-resistant lines, (2) transgenic flies with altered desaturase expression and (3) natural and laboratory-induced CH variants. We also explored the possible relationship between desiccation resistance, relative water content and fecundity in females.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that increased desiccation resistance is linked with the increased proportion of desaturated CHs, but not with their total amount. Experimentally-induced desiccation resistance and CH variation both remained stable after many generations without selection. Conversely, flies with a higher water content and a lower proportion of desaturated CHs showed reduced desiccation resistance. This was also the case in flies with defective desaturase expression in the fat body.
    

    
  


        Discussion:
      
    

    
      We conclude that rapidly acquired desiccation resistance, depending on both CH profile and water content, can remain stable without selection in a humid environment. These three phenotypes, which might be expected to show a simple relationship, turn out to have complex physiological and genetic links.",2018,"Jean-Francois Ferveur, Jérôme Cortot, Karen Rihani, Matthew Cobb, Claude Everaerts, Jean-Francois Ferveur, Jérôme Cortot, Karen Rihani, Matthew Cobb, Claude Everaerts"
Genome-Wide Screen for New Components of the Drosophila melanogaster Torso Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Pathway,29363515,10.1534/g3.117.300491,"Patterning of the Drosophila embryonic termini by the Torso (Tor) receptor pathway has long served as a valuable paradigm for understanding how receptor tyrosine kinase signaling is controlled. However, the mechanisms that underpin the control of Tor signaling remain to be fully understood. In particular, it is unclear how the Perforin-like protein Torso-like (Tsl) localizes Tor activity to the embryonic termini. To shed light on this, together with other aspects of Tor pathway function, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify new pathway components that operate downstream of Tsl. Using a set of molecularly defined chromosomal deficiencies, we screened for suppressors of ligand-dependent Tor signaling induced by unrestricted Tsl expression. This approach yielded 59 genomic suppressor regions, 11 of which we mapped to the causative gene, and a further 29 that were mapped to <15 genes. Of the identified genes, six represent previously unknown regulators of embryonic Tor signaling. These include twins (tws), which encodes an integral subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A complex, and α-tubulin at 84B (αTub84B), a major constituent of the microtubule network, suggesting that these may play an important part in terminal patterning. Together, these data comprise a valuable resource for the discovery of new Tor pathway components. Many of these may also be required for other roles of Tor in development, such as in the larval prothoracic gland where Tor signaling controls the initiation of metamorphosis.",2018,"Alex R Johns, Michelle A Henstridge, Melissa J Saligari, Karyn A Moore, James C Whisstock, Coral G Warr, Travis K Johnson, Alex R Johns, Michelle A Henstridge, Melissa J Saligari, Karyn A Moore, James C Whisstock, Coral G Warr, Travis K Johnson"
A novel ex vivo method for measuring whole brain metabolism in model systems,29287743,10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.12.020,"Background:
      
    

    
      Many neuronal and glial diseases have been associated with changes in metabolism. Therefore, metabolic reprogramming has become an important area of research to better understand disease at the cellular level, as well as to identify targets for treatment. Model systems are ideal for interrogating metabolic questions in a tissue dependent context. However, while new tools have been developed to study metabolism in cultured cells there has been less progress towards studies in vivo and ex vivo.
    

    
  


        New method:
      
    

    
      We have developed a method using newly designed tissue restraints to adapt the Agilent XFe96 metabolic analyzer for whole brain analysis. These restraints create a chamber for Drosophila brains and other small model system tissues to reside undisrupted, while still remaining in the zone for measurements by sensor probes.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      This method generates reproducible oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate data for Drosophila larval and adult brains. Single brains are effectively treated with inhibitors and expected metabolic readings are observed. Measuring metabolic changes, such as glycolytic rate, in transgenic larval brains demonstrates the potential for studying how genotype affects metabolism.
    

    
  


        Comparison with existing methods and conclusions:
      
    

    
      Current methodology either utilizes whole animal chambers to measure respiration, not allowing for targeted tissue analysis, or uses technically challenging MRI technology for in vivo analysis that is not suitable for smaller model systems.

Convergent origination of a Drosophila-like dosage compensation mechanism in a reptile lineage,29133310,10.1101/gr.223727.117,"Sex chromosomes differentiated from different ancestral autosomes in various vertebrate lineages. Here, we trace the functional evolution of the XY Chromosomes of the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), on the basis of extensive high-throughput genome, transcriptome and histone modification sequencing data and revisit dosage compensation evolution in representative mammals and birds with substantial new expression data. Our analyses show that Anolis sex chromosomes represent an ancient XY system that originated at least ≈160 million years ago in the ancestor of Iguania lizards, shortly after the separation from the snake lineage. The age of this system approximately coincides with the ages of the avian and two mammalian sex chromosomes systems. To compensate for the almost complete Y Chromosome degeneration, X-linked genes have become twofold up-regulated, restoring ancestral expression levels. The highly efficient dosage compensation mechanism of Anolis represents the only vertebrate case identified so far to fully support Ohno's original dosage compensation hypothesis. Further analyses reveal that X up-regulation occurs only in males and is mediated by a male-specific chromatin machinery that leads to global hyperacetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 specifically on the X Chromosome. The green anole dosage compensation mechanism is highly reminiscent of that of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster Altogether, our work unveils the convergent emergence of a Drosophila-like dosage compensation mechanism in an ancient reptilian sex chromosome system and highlights that the evolutionary pressures imposed by sex chromosome dosage reductions in different amniotes were resolved in fundamentally different ways.",2017,"Ray Marin, Diego Cortez, Francesco Lamanna, Madapura M Pradeepa, Evgeny Leushkin, Philippe Julien, Angélica Liechti, Jean Halbert, Thoomke Brüning, Katharina Mössinger, Timo Trefzer, Christian Conrad, Halie N Kerver, Juli Wade, Patrick Tschopp, Henrik Kaessmann, Ray Marin, Diego Cortez, Francesco Lamanna, Madapura M Pradeepa, Evgeny Leushkin, Philippe Julien, Angélica Liechti, Jean Halbert, Thoomke Brüning, Katharina Mössinger, Timo Trefzer, Christian Conrad, Halie N Kerver, Juli Wade, Patrick Tschopp, Henrik Kaessmann"
SIK3-HDAC4 signaling regulates Drosophila circadian male sex drive rhythm via modulating the DN1 clock neurons,28743754,10.1073/pnas.1620483114,"The physiology and behavior of many organisms are subject to daily cycles. In Drosophila melanogaster the daily locomotion patterns of single flies are characterized by bursts of activity at dawn and dusk. Two distinct clusters of clock neurons-morning oscillators (M cells) and evening oscillators (E cells)-are largely responsible for these activity bursts. In contrast, male-female pairs of flies follow a distinct pattern, most notably characterized by an activity trough at dusk followed by a high level of male courtship during the night. This male sex drive rhythm (MSDR) is mediated by the M cells along with DN1 neurons, a cluster of clock neurons located in the dorsal posterior region of the brain. Here we report that males lacking Salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) expression in M cells exhibit a short period of MSDR but a long period of single-fly locomotor rhythm (SLR). Moreover, lack of Sik3 in M cells decreases the amplitude of PERIOD (PER) cycling in DN1 neurons, suggesting that SIK3 non-cell-autonomously regulates DN1 neurons' molecular clock. We also show that Sik3 reduction interferes with circadian nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a SIK3 phosphorylation target, in clock neurons and that constitutive HDAC4 localization in the nucleus shortens the period of MSDR. Taking these findings together, we conclude that SIK3-HDAC4 signaling in M cells regulates MSDR by regulating the molecular oscillation in DN1 neurons.",2017,"Shinsuke Fujii, Patrick Emery, Hubert Amrein, Shinsuke Fujii, Patrick Emery, Hubert Amrein"
The Mapping of Predicted Triplex DNA:RNA in the Drosophila Genome Reveals a Prominent Location in Development- and Morphogenesis-Related Genes,28515050,10.1534/g3.117.042911,"Double-stranded DNA is able to form triple-helical structures by accommodating a third nucleotide strand. A nucleic acid triplex occurs according to Hoogsteen rules that predict the stability and affinity of the third strand bound to the Watson-Crick duplex. The ""triplex-forming oligonucleotide"" (TFO) can be a short sequence of RNA that binds to the major groove of the targeted duplex only when this duplex presents a sequence of purine or pyrimidine bases in one of the DNA strands. Many nuclear proteins are known to bind triplex DNA or DNA:RNA, but their biological functions are unexplored. We identified sequences that are capable of engaging as the ""triplex-forming oligonucleotide"" in both the pre-lncRNA and pre-mRNA collections of Drosophila melanogaster These motifs were matched against the Drosophila genome in order to identify putative sequences of triplex formation in intergenic regions, promoters, and introns/exons. Most of the identified TFOs appear to be located in the intronic region of the analyzed genes. Computational prediction of the most targeted genes by TFOs originating from pre-lncRNAs and pre-mRNAs revealed that they are restrictively associated with development- and morphogenesis-related gene networks. The refined analysis by Gene Ontology enrichment demonstrates that some individual TFOs present genome-wide scale matches that are located in numerous genes and regulatory sequences. The triplex DNA:RNA computational mapping at the genome-wide scale suggests broad interference in the regulatory process of the gene networks orchestrated by TFO RNAs acting in association simultaneously at multiple sites.",2017,"Claude Pasquier, Sandra Agnel, Alain Robichon, Claude Pasquier, Sandra Agnel, Alain Robichon"
Uncovering the benefits of fluctuating thermal regimes on cold tolerance of drosophila flies by combined metabolomic and lipidomic approach,27542540,10.1016/j.bbalip.2016.08.008,"When exposed to constant low temperatures (CLTs), insects often suffer from cumulative physiological injuries that can severely compromise their fitness and survival. Yet, mortality can be considerably lowered when the cold stress period is interrupted by periodic warm interruption(s), referred to as fluctuating thermal regimes, FTRs. In this study, we have shown that FTRs strongly promoted cold tolerance of Drosophila melanogaster adults. We then assessed whether this marked phenotypic shift was associated with detectable physiological changes, such as synthesis of cryoprotectants and/or membrane remodeling. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two different time-series Omics analyzes in adult flies submitted to CLTs vs. FTRs: metabolomics (GC/MS) and lipidomics (LC/ESI/MS) targeting membrane phospholipids. We observed increasing levels in several polyhydric alcohols (arabitol, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol), sugars (fructose, mannose) and amino acids (serine, alanine, glutamine) in flies under CLT. Prolonged exposure to low temperature was also associated with a marked deviation of metabolic homeostasis and warm interruptions as short as 2h were sufficient to periodically return the metabolic system to functionality. Lipidomics revealed an increased relative proportion of phosphatidylethanolamines and a shortening of fatty acyl chains in flies exposed to cold, likely to compensate for the ordering effect of low temperature on membranes. We found a remarkable correspondence in the time-course of changes between the metabolic and phospholipids networks, both suggesting a fast homeostatic regeneration during warm intervals under FTRs. In consequence, we suggest that periodic opportunities to restore system-wide homeostasis contribute to promote cold tolerance under FTRs.",2016,"Hervé Colinet, David Renault, Marion Javal, Petra Berková, Petr Šimek, Vladimír Koštál, Hervé Colinet, David Renault, Marion Javal, Petra Berková, Petr Šimek, Vladimír Koštál"
The commonly used eye-specific sev-GAL4 and GMR-GAL4 drivers in Drosophila melanogaster are expressed in tissues other than eyes also,26440079,10.1007/s12041-015-0535-8,"The binary GAL4-UAS system of conditional gene expression is widely used by Drosophila geneticists to target expression of the desired transgene in tissue of interest. In many studies, a preferred target tissue is the Drosophila eye, for which the sev-GAL4 and GMR-GAL4 drivers are most widely used since they are believed to be expressed exclusively in the developing eye cells. However, several reports have noted lethality following expression of certain transgenes under these GAL4 drivers notwithstanding the fact that eye is not essential for survival of the fly. Therefore, to explore the possibility that these drivers may also be active in tissues other than eye, we examined the expression of UAS-GFP reporter driven by the sev-GAL4 or GMR-GAL4 drivers. We found that both these drivers are indeed expressed in additional tissues, including a common set of specific neuronal cells in larval and pupal ventral and cerebral ganglia. Neither sev nor glass gene has so far been reported to be expressed in these neuronal cells. Expression pattern of sev-GAL4 driver parallels that of the endogenous Sevenless protein. In addition to cells in which sev-GAL4 is expressed, the GMR-GAL4 is expressed in several other larval cell types also. Further, two different GMR-GAL4 lines also show some specific differences in their expression domains outside the eye discs. These findings emphasize the need for a careful confirmation of the expression domains of a GAL4 driver being used in a given study, rather than relying only on the empirically claimed expression domains.",2015,"Mukulika Ray, Subhash C Lakhotia, Mukulika Ray, Subhash C Lakhotia"
Class I myosins have overlapping and specialized functions in left-right asymmetric development in Drosophila,25659376,10.1534/genetics.115.174698,"The class I myosin genes are conserved in diverse organisms, and their gene products are involved in actin dynamics, endocytosis, and signal transduction. Drosophila melanogaster has three class I myosin genes, Myosin 31DF (Myo31DF), Myosin 61F (Myo61F), and Myosin 95E (Myo95E). Myo31DF, Myo61F, and Myo95E belong to the Myosin ID, Myosin IC, and Myosin IB families, respectively. Previous loss-of-function analyses of Myo31DF and Myo61F revealed important roles in left-right (LR) asymmetric development and enterocyte maintenance, respectively. However, it was difficult to elucidate their roles in vivo, because of potential redundant activities. Here we generated class I myosin double and triple mutants to address this issue. We found that the triple mutant was viable and fertile, indicating that all three class I myosins were dispensable for survival. A loss-of-function analysis revealed further that Myo31DF and Myo61F, but not Myo95E, had redundant functions in promoting the dextral LR asymmetric development of the male genitalia. Myo61F overexpression is known to antagonize the dextral activity of Myo31DF in various Drosophila organs. Thus, the LR-reversing activity of overexpressed Myo61F may not reflect its physiological function. The endogenous activity of Myo61F in promoting dextral LR asymmetric development was observed in the male genitalia, but not the embryonic gut, another LR asymmetric organ. Thus, Myo61F and Myo31DF, but not Myo95E, play tissue-specific, redundant roles in LR asymmetric development.

The centrosome orientation checkpoint is germline stem cell specific and operates prior to the spindle assembly checkpoint in Drosophila testis,25480919,10.1242/dev.117044,"Asymmetric cell division is utilized by a broad range of cell types to generate two daughter cells with distinct cell fates. In stem cell populations asymmetric cell division is believed to be crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, failure of which can lead to tissue degeneration or hyperplasia/tumorigenesis. Asymmetric cell divisions also underlie cell fate diversification during development. Accordingly, the mechanisms by which asymmetric cell division is achieved have been extensively studied, although the check points that are in place to protect against potential perturbation of the process are poorly understood. Drosophila melanogaster male germline stem cells (GSCs) possess a checkpoint, termed the centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC), that monitors correct centrosome orientation with respect to the component cells of the niche to ensure asymmetric stem cell division. To our knowledge, the COC is the only checkpoint mechanism identified to date that specializes in monitoring the orientation of cell division in multicellular organisms. Here, by establishing colcemid-induced microtubule depolymerization as a sensitive assay, we examined the characteristics of COC activity and find that it functions uniquely in GSCs but not in their differentiating progeny. We show that the COC operates in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, independently of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

Structure-function analyses of tyrosine phosphatase PTP69D in giant fiber synapse formation of Drosophila,25433167,10.1016/j.mcn.2014.11.002,"PTP69D is a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) with two intracellular catalytic domains (Cat1 and Cat2) and has been shown to play a role in axon guidance of embryonic motoneurons as well as targeting of photoreceptor neurons in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we characterized the developmental role of PTP69D in the giant fiber (GF) neurons, two interneurons in the central nervous system (CNS) that control the escape response of the fly. Our studies revealed that PTP69D has a function in synaptic terminal growth in the CNS. We found that missense mutations in the first immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and in the Cat1 domain, present in Ptp69D10 and Ptp69D20 mutants, respectively, did not affect axon guidance or targeting but resulted in stunted terminal growth of the GFs. Cell autonomous rescue experiments demonstrated a function for the Cat1 and the first Ig domain of PTP69D in the GFs but not in its postsynaptic target neurons. In addition, complementation studies and structure-function analyses revealed that for GF terminal growth Cat1 function of PTP69D requires the immunoglobulin and the Cat2 domains, but not the fibronectin III or the membrane proximal region domains. In contrast, the fibronectin III but not the immunoglobulin domains were previously shown to be essential for axon targeting of photoreceptor neurons. Thus, our studies uncover a novel role for PTP69D in synaptic terminal growth in the CNS that is mechanistically distinct from its function in photoreceptor targeting.",2015,"LaTasha H Lee, Tanja A Godenschwege, LaTasha H Lee, Tanja A Godenschwege"
Evidence for stabilizing selection on codon usage in chromosomal rearrangements of Drosophila pseudoobscura,25326424,10.1534/g3.114.014860,"There has been a renewed interest in investigating the role of stabilizing selection acting on genome-wide traits such as codon usage bias. Codon bias, when synonymous codons are used at unequal frequencies, occurs in a wide variety of taxa. Standard evolutionary models explain the maintenance of codon bias through a balance of genetic drift, mutation and weak purifying selection. The efficacy of selection is expected to be reduced in regions of suppressed recombination. Contrary to observations in Drosophila melanogaster, some recent studies have failed to detect a relationship between the recombination rate, intensity of selection acting at synonymous sites, and the magnitude of codon bias as predicted under these standard models. Here, we examined codon bias in 2798 protein coding loci on the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura using whole-genome sequences of 47 individuals, representing five common third chromosome gene arrangements. Fine-scale recombination maps were constructed using more than 1 million segregating sites. As expected, recombination was demonstrated to be significantly suppressed between chromosome arrangements, allowing for a direct examination of the relationship between recombination, selection, and codon bias. As with other Drosophila species, we observe a strong mutational bias away from the most frequently used codons. We find the rate of synonymous and nonsynonymous polymorphism is variable between different amino acids. However, we do not observe a reduction in codon bias or the strength of selection in regions of suppressed recombination as expected. Instead, we find that the interaction between weak stabilizing selection and mutational bias likely plays a role in shaping the composition of synonymous codons across the third chromosome in D. pseudoobscura.",2014,"Zachary L Fuller, Gwilym D Haynes, Dianhui Zhu, Matthew Batterton, Hsu Chao, Shannon Dugan, Mehwish Javaid, Joy C Jayaseelan, Sandra Lee, Mingmei Li, Fiona Ongeri, Sulan Qi, Yi Han, Harshavardhan Doddapaneni, Stephen Richards, Stephen W Schaeffer, Zachary L Fuller, Gwilym D Haynes, Dianhui Zhu, Matthew Batterton, Hsu Chao, Shannon Dugan, Mehwish Javaid, Joy C Jayaseelan, Sandra Lee, Mingmei Li, Fiona Ongeri, Sulan Qi, Yi Han, Harshavardhan Doddapaneni, Stephen Richards, Stephen W Schaeffer"
Differences in neural circuitry guiding behavioral responses to polarized light presented to either the dorsal or ventral retina in Drosophila,24912584,10.3109/01677063.2014.922556,"Linearly polarized light (POL) serves as an important cue for many animals, providing navigational information, as well as directing them toward food sources and reproduction sites. Many insects detect the celestial polarization pattern, or the linearly polarized reflections off of surfaces, such as water. Much progress has been made toward characterizing both retinal detectors and downstream circuit elements responsible for celestial POL vision in different insect species, yet much less is known about the neural basis of how polarized reflections are detected. We previously established a novel, fully automated behavioral assay for studying the spontaneous orientation response of Drosophila melanogaster populations to POL stimuli presented to either the dorsal, or the ventral halves of the retina. We identified separate retinal detectors mediating these responses: the 'Dorsal Rim Area' (DRA), which had long been implicated in celestial POL vision, as well as a previously uncharacterized 'ventral polarization area' (VPA). In this study, we investigate whether DRA and VPA use the same or different downstream circuitry, for mediating spontaneous behavioral responses. We use homozygous mutants, or molecular genetic circuit-breaking tools (silencing, as well as rescue of synaptic activity), in combination with our behavioral paradigm. We show that responses to dorsal versus ventral stimulation involve previously characterized optic lobe neurons, like lamina monopolar cell L2 and medulla cell types Dm8/Tm5c. However, using different experimental conditions, we show that important differences exist between the requirement of these cell types downstream of DRA versus VPA. Therefore, while the neural circuits underlying behavioral responses to celestial and reflected POL cues share important building blocks, these elements play different functional roles within the network.",2014,"Mariel M Velez, Daryl Gohl, Thomas R Clandinin, Mathias F Wernet, Mariel M Velez, Daryl Gohl, Thomas R Clandinin, Mathias F Wernet"
Olfactory habituation in Drosophila-odor encoding and its plasticity in the antennal lobe,24767477,10.1016/B978-0-444-63350-7.00001-2,"A ubiquitous feature of an animal's response to an odorant is that it declines when the odorant is frequently or continuously encountered. This decline in olfactory response, termed olfactory habituation, can have temporally or mechanistically different forms. The neural circuitry of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster's olfactory system is well defined in terms of component cells, which are readily accessible to functional studies and genetic manipulation. This makes it a particularly useful preparation for the investigation of olfactory habituation. In addition, the insect olfactory system shares many architectural and functional similarities with mammalian olfactory systems, suggesting that olfactory mechanisms in insects may be broadly relevant. In this chapter, we discuss the likely mechanisms of olfactory habituation in context of the participating cell types, their connectivity, and their roles in sensory processing. We overview the structure and function of key cell types, the mechanisms that stimulate them, and how they transduce and process odor signals. We then consider how each stage of olfactory processing could potentially contribute to behavioral habituation. After this, we overview a variety of recent mechanistic studies that point to an important role for potentiation of inhibitory synapses in the primary olfactory processing center, the antennal lobe, in driving the reduced response to familiar odorants. Following the discussion of mechanisms for short- and long-term olfactory habituation, we end by considering how these mechanisms may be regulated by neuromodulators, which likely play key roles in the induction, gating, or suppression of habituated behavior, and speculate on the relevance of these processes for other forms of learning and memory.",2014,"Isabell Twick, John Anthony Lee, Mani Ramaswami, Isabell Twick, John Anthony Lee, Mani Ramaswami"
The transmembrane protein Macroglobulin complement-related is essential for septate junction formation and epithelial barrier function in Drosophila,24496626,10.1242/dev.102160,"Occluding cell-cell junctions in epithelia form physical barriers that separate different membrane domains, restrict paracellular diffusion and prevent pathogens from spreading across tissues. In invertebrates, these functions are provided by septate junctions (SJs), the functional equivalent of vertebrate tight junctions. How the diverse functions of SJs are integrated and modulated in a multiprotein complex is not clear, and many SJ components are still unknown. Here we report the identification of Macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr), a member of the conserved α-2-macroglobulin (α2M) complement protein family, as a novel SJ-associated protein in Drosophila. Whereas α2M complement proteins are generally known as secreted factors that bind to surfaces of pathogens and target them for phagocytic uptake, Mcr represents an unusual α2M protein with a predicted transmembrane domain. We show that Mcr protein localizes to lateral membranes of epithelial cells, where its distribution overlaps with SJs. Several SJ components are required for the correct localization of Mcr. Conversely, Mcr is required in a cell-autonomous fashion for the correct membrane localization of SJ components, indicating that membrane-bound rather than secreted Mcr isoforms are involved in SJ formation. Finally, we show that loss of Mcr function leads to morphological, ultrastructural and epithelial barrier defects resembling mutants lacking SJ components. Our results, along with previous findings on the role of Mcr in phagocytosis, suggest that Mcr plays dual roles in epithelial barrier formation and innate immunity. Thus, Mcr represents a novel paradigm for investigating functional links between occluding junction formation and pathogen defense mechanisms.",2014,"Tilmann Bätz, Dominique Förster, Stefan Luschnig, Tilmann Bätz, Dominique Förster, Stefan Luschnig"
Design of RNA splicing analysis null models for post hoc filtering of Drosophila head RNA-Seq data with the splicing analysis kit (Spanki),24209455,10.1186/1471-2105-14-320,"Background:
      
    

    
      The production of multiple transcript isoforms from one gene is a major source of transcriptome complexity. RNA-Seq experiments, in which transcripts are converted to cDNA and sequenced, allow the resolution and quantification of alternative transcript isoforms. However, methods to analyze splicing are underdeveloped and errors resulting in incorrect splicing calls occur in every experiment.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We used RNA-Seq data to develop sequencing and aligner error models. By applying these error models to known input from simulations, we found that errors result from false alignment to minor splice motifs and antisense stands, shifted junction positions, paralog joining, and repeat induced gaps. By using a series of quantitative and qualitative filters, we eliminated diagnosed errors in the simulation, and applied this to RNA-Seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. We used high-confidence junction detections to specifically interrogate local splicing differences between transcripts. This method out-performed commonly used RNA-seq methods to identify known alternative splicing events in the Drosophila sex determination pathway. We describe a flexible software package to perform these tasks called Splicing Analysis Kit (Spanki), available at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/spanki.

[Structural features of chromatin organization of 3C6/C7 interband in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes],23795466,,"This article presents an analysis of the causes of chromatin decompaction of interbands in Drosophila polytene chromosomes. On the example of interband 3C6/C7 of X chromosome, we investigate the ability of different DNA segments from the region to form an interband in a new genetic environment. Site-specific FLP recombination between two transposons with FRT-sites allows introducing the DNA fragments from the inter-band 3C6/C7 into plCon(dv) transposon located in cytologically well-characterized 84F region of chromosome 3 followed by electron microscopic analysis of changes in the region, caused by insertion of the DNA fragments into the transposon. Thus, it has shown that the insertion of DNA fragment 276 bp in length from 3C6/C7 region into the plCon(dv) transposon leads to the formation of a new interband between two thin bands which are represented by material of the transposon. To date, the DNA fragment is minimal known sequence that is necessary and sufficient for interband formation. In addition, the sequence containing three tandemly repeated copies of DNA fragment 0.9 kb including a fragment of 276 bp from the interband 3C6/C7 was integrated in the transposon. The presence of additional copies of the DNA fragment did not change the morphology of the resulting interband. It was shown that sites of hypersensitivity to DNase I persist in interbands formed in the new genetic environment. The data obtained allow us to start analysis of the specific factors (proteins, DNA motifs, etc.) that determine the formation of decompacted chromatin state in sertain interband region and, as a whole, chromometric organization of interphase chromosomes in Drosophila.",2013,"A Iu Konev, A A Makase, D K Pokrovskiĭ, M A Ignat'eva, Iu A Il'ina, L V Kotlovanova, A Iu Konev, A A Makase, D K Pokrovskiĭ, M A Ignat'eva, Iu A Il'ina, L V Kotlovanova"
Proteasome dysfunction in Drosophila signals to an Nrf2-dependent regulatory circuit aiming to restore proteostasis and prevent premature aging,23738891,10.1111/acel.12111,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is central to the regulation of cellular proteostasis. Nevertheless, the impact of in vivo proteasome dysfunction on the proteostasis networks and the aging processes remains poorly understood. We found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of 20S proteasome subunits in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in larval lethality. We therefore studied the molecular effects of proteasome dysfunction in adult flies by developing a model of dose-dependent pharmacological proteasome inhibition. Impaired proteasome function promoted several 'old-age' phenotypes and markedly reduced flies' lifespan. In young somatic tissues and in gonads of all ages, loss of proteasome activity induced higher expression levels and assembly rates of proteasome subunits. Proteasome dysfunction was signaled to the proteostasis network by reactive oxygen species that originated from malfunctioning mitochondria and triggered an Nrf2-dependent upregulation of the proteasome subunits. RNAi-mediated Nrf2 knockdown reduced proteasome activities, flies' resistance to stress, as well as longevity. Conversely, inducible activation of Nrf2 in transgenic flies upregulated basal proteasome expression and activity independently of age and conferred resistance to proteotoxic stress. Interestingly, prolonged Nrf2 overexpression reduced longevity, indicating that excessive activation of the proteostasis pathways can be detrimental. Our in vivo studies add new knowledge on the proteotoxic stress-related regulation of the proteostasis networks in higher metazoans. Proteasome dysfunction triggers the activation of an Nrf2-dependent tissue- and age-specific regulatory circuit aiming to adjust the cellular proteasome activity according to temporal and/or spatial proteolytic demands. Prolonged deregulation of this proteostasis circuit accelerates aging.",2013,"Eleni N Tsakiri, Gerasimos P Sykiotis, Issidora S Papassideri, Evangelos Terpos, Meletios A Dimopoulos, Vassilis G Gorgoulis, Dirk Bohmann, Ioannis P Trougakos, Eleni N Tsakiri, Gerasimos P Sykiotis, Issidora S Papassideri, Evangelos Terpos, Meletios A Dimopoulos, Vassilis G Gorgoulis, Dirk Bohmann, Ioannis P Trougakos"
Ligand binding pocket function of Drosophila USP is necessary for metamorphosis,23211750,10.1016/j.ygcen.2012.11.009,"The widely accepted paradigm that epoxidized methyl farnesoates (""juvenile hormones,"" JHs) are the principal sesquiterpenoid hormones regulating insect metamorphosis was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster. GC-MS analysis of circulating methyl farnesoids during the mid to late 3rd instar showed that methyl farnesoate is predominant over methyl epoxyfarnesoate (=JH III). The circulating concentration of methyl farnesoate (reaching nearly 500 nM), was easily high enough on a kinetic basis to load the Drosophila ortholog of the nuclear hormone receptor RXR (also known as ""ultraspiracle,"" USP), whereas the circulating concentrations of JH III and methyl bisepoxyfarnesoate (bisepoxyJH III) were not. The hypothesis that the ligand pocket of USP necessarily binds an endogenous ligand for differentiation of the immature to the adult was tested with USP mutated at residue that normally extends a side chain into the ligand binding pocket. An equilibrium binding assay confirmed that the mutation (Q288A) strongly altered methyl farnesoate interaction with USP, while a heterologous cell-line transfection assay confirmed that the mutation did not allosterically alter the transcriptional response of the ultraspiracle/ecdysone receptor heterodimer to ecdysteroid signaling. Transgenic wildtype USP driven by the cognate natural promoter rescued null animals to develop to the adult inside a normally formed puparium, while in contrast animals transgenically expressing instead the ligand pocket mutant exhibited developmental derangement at the larval to pupal transition, including failure to form a properly shaped or sclerotized puparium. Other point mutations to the pocket strongly reducing affinity for methyl farnesoate similarly disrupted the larval to pupal metamorphosis. These results suggest that normal larval to pupal maturation in this mecopteran model insect requires the involvement of a distinct endocrine axis of USP binding to its own endogenous terpenoid ligand.",2013,"Grace Jones, Peter Teal, Vincent C Henrich, Anna Krzywonos, Agnes Sapa, Mietek Wozniak, John Smolka, Davy Jones, Grace Jones, Peter Teal, Vincent C Henrich, Anna Krzywonos, Agnes Sapa, Mietek Wozniak, John Smolka, Davy Jones"
The effect of TiO(2) and Ag nanoparticles on reproduction and development of Drosophila melanogaster and CD-1 mice,22005274,10.1016/j.taap.2011.09.027,"In the last two decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have found applications in a wide variety of consumer goods. Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and silver (Ag) NPs are both found in cosmetics and foods, but their increasing use is of concern due to their ability to be taken up by biological systems. While there are some reports of TiO(2) and Ag NPs affecting complex organisms, their effects on reproduction and development have been largely understudied. Here, the effects of orally administered TiO(2) or Ag NPs on reproduction and development in two different model organisms were investigated. TiO(2) NPs reduced the developmental success of CD-1 mice after a single oral dose of 100 or 1000 mg/kg to dams, resulting in a statistically significant increase in fetal deformities and mortality. Similarly, TiO(2) NP addition to food led to a significant progeny loss in the fruit fly, Drosophila, as shown by a decline in female fecundity. Ag NP administration resulted in an increase in the mortality of fetal mice. Similarly in Drosophila, Ag NP feeding led to a significant decrease in developmental success, but unlike TiO(2) NP treatment, there was no decline in fecundity. The distinct response associated with each type of NP likely reflects differences in NP administration as well as the biology of the particular model. Taken together, however, this study warns that these common NPs could be detrimental to the reproductive and developmental health of both invertebrates and vertebrates.",2011,"Nicola A Philbrook, Louise M Winn, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Virginia K Walker, Nicola A Philbrook, Louise M Winn, A R M Nabiul Afrooz, Navid B Saleh, Virginia K Walker"
The Drosophila carbonyl reductase sniffer is an efficient 4-oxonon-2-enal (4ONE) reductase,21167142,10.1016/j.cbi.2010.12.006,"Studies with the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated that the enzyme sniffer prevented oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration. Mutant flies overexpressing sniffer had significantly extended life spans in a 99.5% oxygen atmosphere compared to wild-type flies. However, the molecular mechanism of this protection remained unclear. Sequence analysis and database searches identified sniffer as a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily with a 27.4% identity to the human enzyme carbonyl reductase type I (CBR1). As CBR1 catalyzes the reduction of the lipid peroxidation products 4HNE and 4ONE, we tested whether sniffer is able to metabolize these lipid derived aldehydes by carbonyl reduction. To produce recombinant enzyme, the coding sequence of sniffer was amplified from a cDNA-library, cloned into a bacterial expression vector and the His-tagged protein was purified by Ni-chelate chromatography. We found that sniffer catalyzed the NADPH-dependent carbonyl reduction of 4ONE (K(m)=24±2 μM, k(cat)=500±10 min(-1), k(cat)/K(m)=350 s(-1) mM(-1)) but not that of 4HNE. The reaction product of 4ONE reduction by sniffer was mainly 4HNE as shown by HPLC- and GC/MS analysis. Since 4HNE, though still a potent electrophile, is less neurotoxic and protein reactive than 4ONE, one mechanism by which sniffer exerts its neuroprotective effects in Drosophila after oxidative stress may be enzymatic reduction of 4ONE.",2011,"Hans-Jörg Martin, Marta Ziemba, Michael Kisiela, José A Botella, Stephan Schneuwly, Edmund Maser, Hans-Jörg Martin, Marta Ziemba, Michael Kisiela, José A Botella, Stephan Schneuwly, Edmund Maser"
High-throughput RNAi screen in Drosophila,19109710,10.1007/978-1-60327-469-2_13,"Genetic and biochemical analyses in model systems such as the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, have successfully identified several genes that play key regulatory roles in fundamental cellular and developmental processes. However, the analyses of the complete genome sequences of Drosophila, as well as of humans, now reveal that traditional methods have ascribed functions to only a fraction of the total predicted genes. Thus, the roles for many, as yet unidentified genes, in normal development and cancer remain to be discovered. The challenge presented by the various large-scale genome projects is how to derive biologically relevant information from the raw sequences. The past few years have witnessed a rapid growth in the development and implementation high-throughput screening (HTS) technologies that researchers are now using to discover ""gene-function"" in an unbiased, systematic, and time-efficient manner. In fact one of the most promising functional genomic approach that has emerged in the past few years is based on RNA-interference (RNAi), in which the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into cells or whole organisms has been shown to be an effective tool to suppress endogenous gene expression. The RNAi technology has made it feasible to query the function of every gene in the genome for their potential function in a given cell-biological process using cell-based assays.

A Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein,18952610,10.1074/jbc.M806474200,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.",2009,"Elena Starostina, Aiguo Xu, Heping Lin, Claudio W Pikielny, Elena Starostina, Aiguo Xu, Heping Lin, Claudio W Pikielny"
The diversity of O-linked glycans expressed during Drosophila melanogaster development reflects stage- and tissue-specific requirements for cell signaling,18725413,10.1074/jbc.M804925200,"Appropriate glycoprotein O-glycosylation is essential for normal development and tissue function in multicellular organisms. To comprehensively assess the developmental and functional impact of altered O-glycosylation, we have extensively analyzed the non-glycosaminoglycan, O-linked glycans expressed in Drosophila embryos. Through multidimensional mass spectrometric analysis of glycans released from glycoproteins by beta-elimination, we detected novel as well as previously reported O-glycans that exhibit developmentally modulated expression. The core 1 mucin-type disaccharide (Galbeta1-3GalNAc) is the predominant glycan in the total profile. HexNAcitol, hexitol, xylosylated hexitol, and branching extension of core 1 with HexNAc (to generate core 2 glycans) were also evident following release and reduction. After Galbeta1-3GalNAc, the next most prevalent glycans were a mixture of novel, isobaric, linear, and branched forms of a glucuronyl core 1 disaccharide. Other less prevalent structures were also extended with HexA, including an O-fucose glycan. Although the expected disaccharide product of the Fringe glycosyltransferase, (GlcNAcbeta1-3)fucitol, was not detectable in whole embryos, mass spectrometry fragmentation and exoglycosidase sensitivity defined a novel glucuronyl trisaccharide as GlcNAcbeta1-3(GlcAbeta1-4)fucitol. Consistent with the spatial distribution of the Fringe function, the GlcA-extended form of the Fringe product was enriched in the dorsal portion of the wing imaginal disc. Furthermore, loss of Fringe activity reduced the prevalence of the O-Fuc trisaccharide. Therefore, O-Fuc glycans necessary for the modulation of important signaling events in Drosophila are, as in vertebrates, substrates for extension beyond the addition of a single HexNAc.",2008,"Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Samuel S Lee, Brian Dong, Khoi Nguyen, Katherine H McGlamry, Michael Tiemeyer, Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Samuel S Lee, Brian Dong, Khoi Nguyen, Katherine H McGlamry, Michael Tiemeyer"
Sustained post-mating response in Drosophila melanogaster requires multiple seminal fluid proteins,18085830,10.1371/journal.pgen.0030238,"Successful reproduction is critical to pass genes to the next generation. Seminal proteins contribute to important reproductive processes that lead to fertilization in species ranging from insects to mammals. In Drosophila, the male's accessory gland is a source of seminal fluid proteins that affect the reproductive output of males and females by altering female post-mating behavior and physiology. Protein classes found in the seminal fluid of Drosophila are similar to those of other organisms, including mammals. By using RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down levels of individual accessory gland proteins (Acps), we investigated the role of 25 Acps in mediating three post-mating female responses: egg production, receptivity to remating and storage of sperm. We detected roles for five Acps in these post-mating responses. CG33943 is required for full stimulation of egg production on the first day after mating. Four other Acps (CG1652, CG1656, CG17575, and CG9997) appear to modulate the long-term response, which is the maintenance of post-mating behavior and physiological changes. The long-term post-mating response requires presence of sperm in storage and, until now, had been known to require only a single Acp. Here, we discovered several novel Acps together are required which together are required for sustained egg production, reduction in receptivity to remating of the mated female and for promotion of stored sperm release from the seminal receptacle. Our results also show that members of conserved protein classes found in seminal plasma from insects to mammals are essential for important reproductive processes.",2007,"K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner, K Ravi Ram, Mariana F Wolfner"
Phenotypic and transcriptional response to selection for alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster,17973985,10.1186/gb-2007-8-10-r231,"Background:
      
    

    
      Alcoholism is a complex disorder determined by interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Drosophila represents a powerful model system to dissect the genetic architecture of alcohol sensitivity, as large numbers of flies can readily be reared in defined genetic backgrounds and under controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, flies exposed to ethanol undergo physiological and behavioral changes that resemble human alcohol intoxication, including loss of postural control, sedation, and development of tolerance.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We performed artificial selection for alcohol sensitivity for 35 generations and created duplicate selection lines that are either highly sensitive or resistant to ethanol exposure along with unselected control lines. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,678 probe sets with different expression levels between the divergent lines, pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of q < 0.001. We assessed to what extent genes with altered transcriptional regulation might be causally associated with ethanol sensitivity by measuring alcohol sensitivity of 37 co-isogenic P-element insertional mutations in 35 candidate genes, and found that 32 of these mutants differed in sensitivity to ethanol exposure from their co-isogenic controls. Furthermore, 23 of these novel genes have human orthologues.

      Combining whole genome expression profiling with selection for genetically divergent lines is an effective approach for identifying candidate genes that affect complex traits, such as alcohol sensitivity.

Separate sets of cerebral clock neurons are responsible for light and temperature entrainment of Drosophila circadian locomotor rhythms,17440213,10.1177/0748730407299344,"The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster shows a bimodal circadian locomotor rhythm with peaks at lights-on and before lights-off, which are regulated by multiple clocks in the brain. Even under light-dark cycles, the timing of the evening peak is highly dependent on temperature, starting earlier under lower ambient temperature but terminating almost at the same time. In the present study, using behavioral and immunohistochemical assays, the authors show that separate groups of clock neurons, either light-entrainable or temperature-entrainable, form a functional system driving the locomotor rhythm. When subjected to a light cycle combined with a temperature cycle advanced by 6 h relative to the light cycle, the dorsally located neurons (DNs) and lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) shifted their phase of TIMELESS expression, but the laterally located protocerebral neurons (LNs) basically maintained their original phase. Thus, the LNs seem to be preferentially light-entrainable and the DNs and LPNs to be primarily temperature-entrainable. In pdf(01) mutant flies that lack the neuropeptide PDF in the ventral groups of LNs, the onset of the evening peak was greatly advanced even under synchronized light and temperature cycles and was shifted even more than in wild-type flies in response to a 6-h phase shift of the temperature cycle, suggesting that ventral LNs have a strong impact on the phase of the other cells. It seems likely that the 2 sets of clock cells with different entrainability to light and temperature, and the coupling between them, enable Drosophila to keep a proper phase relationship of circadian activity with respect to the daily light and temperature cycles.",2007,"Yoko Miyasako, Yujiro Umezaki, Kenji Tomioka, Yoko Miyasako, Yujiro Umezaki, Kenji Tomioka"

      This paper describes the Virtual Insect Brain (VIB) protocol, a script suite for the quantitative assessment, comparison, and presentation of neuroanatomical data. It is based on the 3D-reconstruction and visualization software Amira, version 3.x (Mercury Inc.) 1. Besides its backbone, a standardization procedure which aligns individual 3D images (series of virtual sections obtained by confocal microscopy) to a common coordinate system and computes average intensities for each voxel (volume pixel) the VIB protocol provides an elaborate data management system for data administration. The VIB protocol facilitates direct comparison of gene expression patterns and describes their interindividual variability. It provides volumetry of brain regions and helps to characterize the phenotypes of brain structure mutants. Using the VIB protocol does not require any programming skills since all operations are carried out at an intuitively usable graphical user interface. Although the VIB protocol has been developed for the standardization of Drosophila neuroanatomy, the program structure can be used for the standardization of other 3D structures as well.

A systems biology analysis of the Drosophila phagosome,17151602,10.1038/nature05380,"Phagocytes have a critical function in remodelling tissues during embryogenesis and thereafter are central effectors of immune defence. During phagocytosis, particles are internalized into 'phagosomes', organelles from which immune processes such as microbial destruction and antigen presentation are initiated. Certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system and persist undetected within phagocytes, and it is therefore evident that a detailed knowledge of this process is essential to an understanding of many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. However, despite the crucial role of phagosomes in immunity, their components and organization are not fully defined. Here we present a systems biology analysis of phagosomes isolated from cells derived from the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster and address the complex dynamic interactions between proteins within this organelle and their involvement in particle engulfment. Proteomic analysis identified 617 proteins potentially associated with Drosophila phagosomes; these were organized by protein-protein interactions to generate the 'phagosome interactome', a detailed protein-protein interaction network of this subcellular compartment. These networks predicted both the architecture of the phagosome and putative biomodules. The contribution of each protein and complex to bacterial internalization was tested by RNA-mediated interference and identified known components of the phagocytic machinery. In addition, the prediction and validation of regulators of phagocytosis such as the 'exocyst', a macromolecular complex required for exocytosis but not previously implicated in phagocytosis, validates this strategy. In generating this 'systems-based model', we show the power of applying this approach to the study of complex cellular processes and organelles and expect that this detailed model of the phagosome will provide a new framework for studying host-pathogen interactions and innate immunity.",2007,"L M Stuart, J Boulais, G M Charriere, E J Hennessy, S Brunet, I Jutras, G Goyette, C Rondeau, S Letarte, H Huang, P Ye, F Morales, C Kocks, J S Bader, M Desjardins, R A B Ezekowitz, L M Stuart, J Boulais, G M Charriere, E J Hennessy, S Brunet, I Jutras, G Goyette, C Rondeau, S Letarte, H Huang, P Ye, F Morales, C Kocks, J S Bader, M Desjardins, R A B Ezekowitz"
Differential Delta expression underlies the diversity of sensory organ patterns among the legs of the Drosophila adult,17107776,10.1016/j.mod.2006.09.004,"Many studies have shown that morphological diversity among homologous animal structures is generated by the homeotic (Hox) genes. However, the mechanisms through which Hox genes specify particular morphological features are not fully understood. We have addressed this issue by investigating how diverse sensory organ patterns are formed among the legs of the Drosophila melanogaster adult. The Drosophila adult has one pair of legs on each of its three thoracic segments (the T1-T3 segments). Although homologous, legs from different segments have distinct morphological features. Our focus is on the formation of diverse patterns of small mechanosensory bristles or microchaetae (mCs) among the legs. On T2 legs, the mCs are organized into a series of longitudinal rows (L-rows) precisely positioned along the leg circumference. The L-rows are observed on all three pairs of legs, but additional and novel pattern elements are found on T1 and T3 legs. For example, at specific positions on T1 and T3 legs, some mCs are organized into transverse rows (T-rows). Our studies indicate that the T-rows on T1 and T3 legs are established as a result of Hox gene modulation of the pathway for patterning the L-row mC bristles. Our findings suggest that the Hox genes, Sex combs reduced (Scr) and Ultrabithorax (Ubx), establish differential expression of the proneural gene achaete (ac) by modifying expression of the ac prepattern regulator, Delta (Dl), in T1 and T3 legs, respectively. This study identifies Dl as a potential link between Hox genes and the sensory organ patterning hierarchy, providing insight into the connection between Hox gene function and the formation of specific morphological features.",2007,"Stuti Shroff, Meghana Joshi, Teresa V Orenic, Stuti Shroff, Meghana Joshi, Teresa V Orenic"
Catalytic properties of domain-exchanged chimeric proteins between firefly luciferase and Drosophila fatty Acyl-CoA synthetase CG6178,17090919,10.1271/bbb.60364,"Firefly luciferase and fatty acyl-CoA synthetase are members of the acyl-CoA synthetase super family, which consists of a large N-terminal domain and a small C-terminal domain. Previously we found that firefly luciferase has fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activity, and also identified that the homolog of firefly luciferase in Drosophila melanogaster (CG6178) is a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase and is not a luciferase. In this study, we constructed chimeric proteins by exchanging the domain between Photinus pyralis luciferase (PpLase) and Drosophila CG6178, and determined luminescence and fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activities. A chimeric protein with the N-terminal domain of PpLase and the C-terminal domain of CG6178 (Pp/Dm) had luminescence activity, showing approximately 4% of the activity of wild-type luciferase. The Pp/Dm protein also had fatty acyl-CoA synthetic activity and the substrate specificity was similar to PpLase. In contrast, a chimeric protein with the N-terminal domain of CG6178 and the C-terminal of PpLase (Dm/Pp) had only fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activity, and the substrate specificity was similar to CG6178. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of firefly luciferase is essential for substrate recognition, and that the C-terminal domain is indispensable but not specialized for the luminescence reaction.",2006,"Yuichi Oba, Kiichi Tanaka, Satoshi Inouye, Yuichi Oba, Kiichi Tanaka, Satoshi Inouye"
"Regulating a circadian clock's period, phase and amplitude by phosphorylation: insights from Drosophila",17012288,10.1093/jb/mvj198,"Much progress has been made in understanding the molecular underpinnings governing circadian ( approximately 24 h) rhythms. Despite the increased complexity in metazoans whereby inter-cellular networks form the basis for driving overt rhythms, such as wake-sleep cycles in animals, single isolated cells can exhibit all the formal properties of a circadian pacemaker. How do these cell-autonomous rhythm generators operate? Breakthrough studies in Drosophila melanogaster led to the realization that the molecular logic underlying circadian clocks are highly shared. Most notably, interconnected transcriptional-translational feedback loops produce coordinated rhythms in ""clock"" RNAs and proteins that are required for the daily progression of clocks, synchronization to local time and transducing temporal signals to downstream effector pathways. More recent findings indicate prominent roles for reversible phosphorylation of clock proteins in the core oscillatory mechanism. In this review we focus on findings in Drosophila to explore the multiple levels that reversible phosphorylation plays in clock function. Specific clock proteins in this system are subjected to different phosphorylation programs, which affect three key properties of a circadian oscillator, its period, amplitude and phase. The role of phosphorylation in clocks is of clear relevance to human health because mutations that affect the PERIOD (PER) phosphorylation program are associated with familial sleep disorders. In addition, the central role of phosphorylation in the assembly of a circadian oscillator was dramatically shown recently by the ability to reconstitute a circadian phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle in vitro, suggesting that the dynamics of clock protein phosphorylation are at the ""heart"" of circadian time-keeping.",2006,"Kiho Bae, Isaac Edery, Kiho Bae, Isaac Edery"
"Of two cytosolic aconitases expressed in Drosophila, only one functions as an iron-regulatory protein",16679315,10.1074/jbc.M603354200,"In mammalian cells, iron homeostasis is largely regulated by post-transcriptional control of gene expression through the binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) to iron-responsive elements (IREs) contained in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs. IRP2 is the dominant iron sensor in mammalian cells under normoxia, but IRP1 is the more ancient protein in evolutionary terms and has an additional function as a cytosolic aconitase. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome does not contain an IRP2 homolog or identifiable IREs; its IRP1 homolog has aconitase activity but does not bind to mammalian IREs. The Drosophila genome offers an evolutionary intermediate containing two IRP1-like proteins (IRP-1A and IRP-1B) and target genes with IREs. Here, we used purified recombinant IRP-1A and IRP-1B from Drosophila melanogaster and showed that only IRP-1A can bind to IREs, although both proteins possess aconitase activity. These results were also corroborated in whole-fly homogenates from transgenic flies that overexpress IRP-1A and IRP-1B in their fat bodies. Ubiquitous and muscle-specific overexpression of IRP-1A, but not of IRP-1B, resulted in pre-adult lethality, underscoring the importance of the biochemical difference between the two proteins. Domain-swap experiments showed that multiple amino acid substitutions scattered throughout the IRP1 domains are synergistically required for conferring IRE binding activity. Our data suggest that as a first step during the evolution of the IRP/IRE system, the ancient cytosolic aconitase was duplicated in insects with one variant acquiring IRE-specific binding.",2006,"Maria I Lind, Fanis Missirlis, Ojar Melefors, Helge Uhrigshardt, Kim Kirby, John P Phillips, Kenneth Söderhäll, Tracey A Rouault, Maria I Lind, Fanis Missirlis, Ojar Melefors, Helge Uhrigshardt, Kim Kirby, John P Phillips, Kenneth Söderhäll, Tracey A Rouault"
A test of quantitative genetic theory using Drosophila- effects of inbreeding and rate of inbreeding on heritabilities and variance components,16033547,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00883.x,"Inbreeding is expected to decrease the heritability within populations. However, results from empirical studies are inconclusive. In this study, we investigated the effects of three breeding treatments (fast and slow rate of inbreeding - inbred to the same absolute level - and a control) on heritability, phenotypic, genetic and environmental variances of sternopleural bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster. Heritability, and phenotypic, genetic and environmental variances were estimated in 10 replicate lines within each of the three treatments. Standard least squares regression models and Bayesian methods were used to analyse the data. Heritability and additive genetic variance within lines were higher in the control compared with both inbreeding treatments. Heritabilities and additive genetic variances within lines were higher in slow compared with fast inbred lines, indicating that slow inbred lines retain more evolutionary potential despite the same expected absolute level of inbreeding. The between line variance was larger with inbreeding and more than twice as large in the fast than in the slow inbred lines. The different pattern of redistribution of genetic variance within and between lines in the two inbred treatments cannot be explained invoking the standard model based on selective neutrality and additive gene action. Environmental variances were higher with inbreeding, and more so with fast inbreeding, indicating that inbreeding and the rate of inbreeding affect environmental sensitivity. The phenotypic variance decreased with inbreeding, but was not affected by the rate of inbreeding. No inbreeding depression for mean sternopleural bristle number was observed in this study. Considerable variance between lines in additive genetic variance within lines was observed, illustrating between line variation in evolutionary potential.",2005,"T N Kristensen, A C Sørensen, D Sorensen, K S Pedersen, J G Sørensen, V Loeschcke, T N Kristensen, A C Sørensen, D Sorensen, K S Pedersen, J G Sørensen, V Loeschcke"
Characterization of Drosophila fruitless-gal4 transgenes reveals expression in male-specific fruitless neurons and innervation of male reproductive structures,15211467,10.1002/cne.20177,"The fruitless (fru) gene acts in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster to establish male sexual behavior. Genetic dissection of the locus has shown that one of the fru gene's promoter, P1, controls the spatial and temporal expression of male-specific FruM proteins critical to determining stereotypical male sexual behavior. By using the Gal4-expression system, we show that a 16-kb fragment of the fru P1 promoter's 5' regulatory region drives the expression of Gal4 in a subset of FruM-expressing neurons within both the pupal and adult CNS. Colocalization of FruM and a Gal4-responsive reporter shows that the fru(P1)-gal4 fusion construct generates expression in both previously characterized FruM-expressing neurons as well as within cells of both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system that have not been demonstrated as FruM-expressing. Gal4-expressing neurons are shown to innervate abdominal organs directly relevant to fru function; specifically, the muscle of Lawrence (MOL) and the male internal reproductive organs. Innervations of the latter are shown to originate from identified FruM-serotonergic neurons. Furthermore, we show that the MOL neuromuscular junction is sexually dimorphic. Finally, we describe Gal4 expression in neurites innervating male reproductive structures that are hypothesized to be targets of fru function. Isolation of the regulatory sequences controlling the expression of fru in the CNS, therefore, provides a potent tool for the manipulation of FruM-expressing neurons and for understanding the cellular basis of Drosophila reproductive behavior.",2004,"Jean-Christophe Billeter, Stephen F Goodwin, Jean-Christophe Billeter, Stephen F Goodwin"
"The versatile thymine DNA-glycosylase: a comparative characterization of the human, Drosophila and fission yeast orthologs",12711670,10.1093/nar/gkg344,"Human thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG) is well known to excise thymine and uracil from G.T and G.U mismatches, respectively, and was therefore proposed to play a central role in the cellular defense against genetic mutation through spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine and cytosine. In this study, we characterized two newly discovered orthologs of TDG, the Drosophila melanogaster Thd1p and the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Thp1p proteins, with an objective to address the function of this subfamily of uracil-DNA glycosylases from an evolutionary perspective. A systematic biochemical comparison of both enzymes with human TDG revealed a number of biologically significant facts. (i) All eukaryotic TDG orthologs have broad and species-specific substrate spectra that include a variety of damaged pyrimidine and purine bases; (ii) the common most efficiently processed substrates of all are uracil and 3,N4- ethenocytosine opposite guanine and 5-fluorouracil in any double-stranded DNA context; (iii) 5-methylcytosine and thymine derivatives are processed with an appreciable efficiency only by the human and the Drosophila enzymes; (iv) none of the proteins is able to hydrolyze a non-damaged 5'-methylcytosine opposite G; and (v) the double strand and mismatch dependency of the enzymes varies with the substrate and is not a stringent feature of this subfamily of DNA glycosylases.

Drosophila Mi-2 negatively regulates dDREF by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity,12077345,10.1128/mcb.22.14.5182-5193.2002,"Drosophila melanogaster DNA replication-related element (DRE) factor (dDREF) is a transcriptional regulatory factor required for the expression of genes carrying the 5'-TATCGATA DRE. dDREF has been reported to bind to a sequence in the chromatin boundary element, and thus, dDREF may play a part in regulating insulator activity. To generate further insights into dDREF function, we carried out a Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screening with DREF polypeptide as bait and identified Mi-2 as a DREF-interacting protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the C-terminal region of Drosophila Mi-2 (dMi-2) specifically binds to the DNA-binding domain of dDREF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that dMi-2 thereby inhibits the DNA-binding activity of dDREF. Ectopic expression of dDREF and dMi-2 in eye imaginal discs resulted in severe and mild rough-eye phenotypes, respectively, whereas flies simultaneously expressing both proteins exhibited almost-normal eye phenotypes. Half-dose reduction of the dMi-2 gene enhanced the DREF-induced rough-eye phenotype. Immunostaining of polytene chromosomes of salivary glands showed that dDREF and dMi-2 bind in mutually exclusive ways. These lines of evidence define a novel function of dMi-2 in the negative regulation of dDREF by its DNA-binding activity.

Ras1 interacts with multiple new signaling and cytoskeletal loci in Drosophila eggshell patterning and morphogenesis,11606538,,"Little is known about the genes that interact with Ras signaling pathways to regulate morphogenesis. The synthesis of dorsal eggshell structures in Drosophila melanogaster requires multiple rounds of Ras signaling followed by dramatic epithelial sheet movements. We took advantage of this process to identify genes that link patterning and morphogenesis; we screened lethal mutations on the second chromosome for those that could enhance a weak Ras1 eggshell phenotype. Of 1618 lethal P-element mutations tested, 13 showed significant enhancement, resulting in forked and fused dorsal appendages. Our genetic and molecular analyses together with information from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project reveal that 11 of these lines carry mutations in previously characterized genes. Three mutations disrupt the known Ras1 cell signaling components Star, Egfr, and Blistered, while one mutation disrupts Sec61beta, implicated in ligand secretion. Seven lines represent cell signaling and cytoskeletal components that are new to the Ras1 pathway; these are Chickadee (Profilin), Tec29, Dreadlocks, POSH, Peanut, Smt3, and MESK2, a suppressor of dominant-negative Ksr. A twelfth insertion disrupts two genes, Nrk, a ""neurospecific"" receptor tyrosine kinase, and Tpp, which encodes a neuropeptidase. These results suggest that Ras1 signaling during oogenesis involves novel components that may be intimately associated with additional signaling processes and with the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. To determine whether these Ras1 Enhancers function upstream or downstream of the Egf receptor, four mutations were tested for their ability to suppress an activated Egfr construct (lambdatop) expressed in oogenesis exclusively in the follicle cells. Mutations in Star and l(2)43Bb had no significant effect upon the lambdatop eggshell defect whereas smt3 and dock alleles significantly suppressed the lambdatop phenotype.",2001,"J D Schnorr, R Holdcraft, B Chevalier, C A Berg, J D Schnorr, R Holdcraft, B Chevalier, C A Berg"
A reverse genetic analysis of components of the Toll signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans,11516642,10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00241-x,"Background:
      
    

    
      Both animals and plants respond rapidly to pathogens by inducing the expression of defense-related genes. Whether such an inducible system of innate immunity is present in the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is currently an open question. Among conserved signaling pathways important for innate immunity, the Toll pathway is the best characterized. In Drosophila, this pathway also has an essential developmental role. C. elegans possesses structural homologs of components of this pathway, and this observation raises the possibility that a Toll pathway might also function in nematodes to trigger defense mechanisms or to control development.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We have generated and characterized deletion mutants for four genes supposed to function in a nematode Toll signaling pathway. These genes are tol-1, trf-1, pik-1, and ikb-1 and are homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster Toll, dTraf, pelle, and cactus genes, respectively. Of these four genes, only tol-1 is required for nematode development. None of them are important for the resistance of C. elegans to a number of pathogens. On the other hand, C. elegans is capable of distinguishing different bacterial species and has a tendency to avoid certain pathogens, including Serratia marcescens. The tol-1 mutants are defective in their avoidance of pathogenic S. marcescens, although other chemosensory behaviors are wild type.

Tissue-specific expression of dominant negative mutant Drosophila HSC70 causes developmental defects and lethality,10397752,10.1091/mbc.10.7.2101,"The Drosophila melanogaster HSC3 and HSC4 genes encode Hsc70 proteins homologous to the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein BiP and the cytoplasmic clathrin uncoating ATPase, respectively. These proteins possess ATP binding/hydrolysis activities that mediate their ability to aid in protein folding by coordinating the sequential binding and release of misfolded proteins. To investigate the roles of HSC3 (Hsc3p) and HSC4 (Hsc4p) proteins during development, GAL4-targeted gene expression was used to analyze the effects of producing dominant negatively acting Hsc3p (D231S, K97S) and Hsc4p (D206S, K71S) proteins, containing single amino acid substitutions in their ATP-binding domains, in specific tissues of Drosophila throughout development. We show that the production of each mutant protein results in lethality over a range of developmental stages, depending on the levels of protein produced and which tissues are targeted. We demonstrate that the functions of both Hsc3p and Hsc4p are required for proper tissue establishment and maintenance. Production of mutant Hsc4p, but not Hsc3p, results in induction of the stress-inducible Hsp70 at normal temperatures. Evidence is presented that lethality is caused by tissue-specific defects that result from a global accumulation of misfolded protein caused by lack of functional Hsc70. We show that both mutant Hsc3ps are defective in ATP-induced substrate release, although Hsc3p(D231S) does undergo an ATP-induced conformational change. We believe that the amino acid substitutions in Hsc3p interfere with the structural coupling of ATP binding to substrate release, and this defect is the basis for the mutant proteins' dominant negative effects in vivo.",1999,"F Elefant, K B Palter, F Elefant, K B Palter"
Transgenes in the Analysis of Life Span and Fitness,29586710,10.1086/303284,"Drosophila P element-mediated transformation can be used to determine whether and how a specific gene contributes to demographic components of fitness. Motivated by the problem of senescence, researchers have applied this approach to genes thought to affect survival through processes of somatic maintenance. Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase and catalase reduce the flux of reactive oxygen molecules that are thought to be a central cause of aging. EF1α is a component of the protein synthesis machine; deterioration of this housekeeping function is a potential contributor to senescence. Molecular chaperones such as the heat shock protein hsp70 are multifunctional molecules that affect a cell's response to acute stress. In some models, senescence results from the cumulative effects of stress, and heat shock proteins may regulate the progress of this deterioration. Transformations with the candidate genes of these proteins were used in independent studies to measure the effect of overexpression on longevity; positive results were reported. Here, I discuss the robustness of these results. I use the studies of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and EF1α to illustrate how the mutagenic effects of inserts confound our interpretations. I present new data from a reported study of hsp70 overexpression to show how engineered constructs can be used to overcome mutagenic artifacts through the controlled excision of sequences or alleles. The data for hsp70 provide the first strong molecular evidence that somatic maintenance affects longevity. Finally, future potential uses of transformation with Drosophila are discussed.

A single immunisation of BALB/c mice with both DS-2 and yeast-cell derived purified HBsAg particles without adjuvants elicited a substantial humoral antibody and class-I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Adsorption of HBsAg particles to aluminium hydroxide resulted in increased levels of HBsAg-specific antibodies. However, CTLs were not elicited by HBsAg/Alum combinations.

INFERENCE OF SPERM COMPETITION FROM BROODS OF FIELD-CAUGHT DROSOPHILA,28565391,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb02015.x,"In field studies of multiple mating and sperm competition there typically is no experimental control over the number of times that a female mates, the interval between matings, or the genetic identity of multiple fathers contributing to a brood. Irrespective of this complexity, high-resolution molecular markers can be used to assign paternity with considerable confidence. This study employed two highly heterozygous microsatellite loci to assess multiple paternity and sperm displacement in a sample of broods taken from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster. The large number of alleles present at each of the loci makes it difficult to derive explicit maximum-likelihood estimates for multiple paternity and sperm displacement from brood samples. Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate maximum-likelihood parameters for the distribution of female remating frequency and the proportion of offspring sired by the second or subsequent mating males. Estimates were made based on genotypes scored at two distinct marker loci because they were found to give statistically homogeneous results. Fitting a Poisson distribution of number of matings, the mean number of males mated by a female was 1.82. The sperm displacement parameter estimated from doubly mated females were 0.79 and 0.86 for the two loci (0.83 for the joint estimate). The overall probability that a multiply mated female will be misclassified as singly mated was only 0.006, which indicates that microsatellites can provide excellent resolution for identifying multiple mating. In addition, microsatellites can be used to generate relatively precise estimates of sperm precedence in brood-structured samples from a natural population.",1998,"Lawrence G Harshman, Andrew G Clark, Lawrence G Harshman, Andrew G Clark"
"ELAV, a Drosophila neuron-specific protein, mediates the generation of an alternatively spliced neural protein isoform",8994828,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)70787-2,"Background:
      
    

    
      Tissue-specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a widely used mechanism for gene regulation and the generation of different protein isoforms, but relatively little is known about the factors and mechanisms that mediate this process. Tissue-specific RNA-binding proteins could mediate alternative pre-mRNA splicing. In Drosophila melanogaster, the RNA-binding protein encoded by the elav (embryonic lethal abnormal visual system) gene is a candidate for such a role. The ELAV protein is expressed exclusively in neurons, and is important for the formation and maintenance of the nervous system.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In this study, photoreceptor neurons genetically depleted of ELAV, and elav-null central nervous system neurons, were analyzed immunocytochemically for the expression of neural proteins. In both situations, the lack of ELAV corresponded with a decrease in the immunohistochemical signal of the neural-specific isoform of Neuroglian, which is generated by alternative splicing. Furthermore, when ELAV was expressed ectopically in cells that normally express only the non-neural isoform of Neuroglian, we observed the generation of the neural isoform of Neuroglian.

      Drosophila ELAV promotes the generation of the neuron-specific isoform of Neuroglian by the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.

The Doa locus encodes a member of a new protein kinase family and is essential for eye and embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster,7926721,10.1101/gad.8.10.1160,"Mutations at the Darkener of apricot (Doa) locus of Drosophila cause roughened eyes and increase transcript accumulation from the retrotransposon copia up to fourfold. Cloning of the gene and sequencing of cDNAs reveals that it encodes a putative serine/threonine protein kinase. Sequence data base searches identify it is a member of a novel highly conserved protein kinase family, with homologs in humans, mice, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, not related to each other previously. Family members are characterized by a peptide motif reading EHLAMMERILG at kinase subdomain X, which is virtually 100% identical in all homologs. We therefore refer to this new family as the LAMMER protein kinases. As predicted from its primary sequence, Doa protein possess intrinsic protein kinase activity when expressed in bacteria, as assayed via autophosphorylation. The gene is expressed throughout development, and both stage and tissue-specific RNAs are found. Its function is essential, because maternally deposited or zygotically transcribed mRNA is required for development to larval stages, and defects in segmentation and development of the nervous system are observed in embryos derived from heteroallelic mothers. Doa function is also critical to Drosophila eye development, because the organization and development of pigment cells, bristles, and photoreceptors are affected in various mutant classes. In the most extreme cases that survive to adulthood, retinal photoreceptors degenerate prior to eclosion. These results demonstrate that the kinase encoded by Doa is required at multiple stages of development, for both differentiation and maintenance of specific cell types.",1994,"B Yun, R Farkas, K Lee, L Rabinow, B Yun, R Farkas, K Lee, L Rabinow"
"Mitochondrial DNA remains intact during Drosophila aging, but the levels of mitochondrial transcripts are significantly reduced",8395521,,"It has been suggested that mutations accumulated in mitochondrial DNA during the aging process may be causally related to the decreased physiological response of the senescent organisms. We have quantified and evaluated the integrity of the mitochondrial genome during the life span of Drosophila melanogaster. Its amount remains fairly constant representing roughly 1% of the total DNA at all ages. Southern experiments have also revealed a high stability and integrity of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). However, we have detected an important decrease in the steady-state levels of all mitochondrial transcripts investigated: 16 S ribosomal RNA (16SrRNA), cytochrome c oxidase, cytochrome b, and beta H(+)-ATP synthase subunit. These changes correlate with the shape of the life span curve, preceding the decrease in survival of the male flies used in the study, and at least in the case of 16SrRNA, is tissue-specific. Although mitochondrial DNA remains unchanged in heads, thoraces, and abdomens, 16SrRNA levels decrease more severely in heads and thoraces and much less conspicuously in abdomens. On the other hand, control non-mitochondrial transcripts investigated remain essentially unaffected. These results suggest that in Drosophila the main effect of aging on the mitochondrial genetic system is downstream from mtDNA itself. The decline in the levels of beta H(+)-ATPase transcript, nuclear-encoded, suggests that not only the mitochondrial machinery, but also the nuclear one involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, is affected during aging.",1993,"M Calleja, P Peña, C Ugalde, C Ferreiro, R Marco, R Garesse, M Calleja, P Peña, C Ugalde, C Ferreiro, R Marco, R Garesse"

The insect exon 2 corresponds to exons 2 to 7 of vertebrate aldolase genes and thus appears to have been formed by the fusion of these 6 exons into a single exon during evolution. The Drosophila aldolase gene is predicted to generate mRNAs for three isozymes (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-types) from the primary transcripts by alternative usage of the final three exons. The reverse transcriptase-PCR assay revealed the occurrence of mRNAs for the three isozymic forms at different developmental stages, and tissue-specific expression was also found to occur in adult flies. In addition to the usual type mRNA species for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-isozymes, two novel forms of mRNAs, alpha beta- and beta gamma-type mRNAs, were detected tissue-specifically in adult flies, although their functions are unpredictable. The alpha beta-mRNA is an alpha-type mRNA in which exon 4 beta remains unspliced, while the beta gamma-mRNA is a beta-type mRNA with the exon 4 gamma remaining unspliced. Recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli were all active and exhibited different enzymatic properties.",1992,"T Kai, Y Sugimoto, T Kusakabe, R Zhang, K Koga, K Hori, T Kai, Y Sugimoto, T Kusakabe, R Zhang, K Koga, K Hori"
Possible involvement of the long terminal repeat of transposable element 17.6 in regulating expression of an insecticide resistance-associated P450 gene in Drosophila,1317576,10.1073/pnas.89.11.4855,"P450-A and P450-B are electrophoretically defined subsets of cytochrome P450 enzymes in Drosophila melanogaster. P450-A is present among all strains tested, whereas expression of P450-B is associated with resistance to insecticides. Monoclonal antibodies were used to obtain cDNA clones for an enzyme from each P450 subset (i.e., P450-A1 and P450-B1). The P450-B1 cDNA was sequenced and shown to code for a P450 of 507 amino acids. Its gene has been named CYP6A2. Comparative molecular analyses of a pair of susceptible, 91-C, and resistant, 91-R, Drosophila strains were made. There was 20-30 times more P450-B1 mRNA in 91-R than in 91-C, and the small amount of P450-B1 mRNA in 91-C was significantly larger in size than that in 91-R. The P450-B1 gene in 91-R was structurally different from that in 91-C but was not amplified. The P450-B1 gene in 91-C contained a solitary long terminal repeat of transposable element 17.6 in its 3' untranslated region. It was absent in the P450-B1 gene of 91-R. On the basis of features of the long terminal repeat and its location in the gene of the susceptible fly, we propose that a posttranscriptional mechanism involving mRNA stability could be involved in regulating P450-B1 gene expression.",1992,"L C Waters, A C Zelhof, B J Shaw, L Y Ch'ang, L C Waters, A C Zelhof, B J Shaw, L Y Ch'ang"
"Time of Recombination in the DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER Oocyte. III. Selection and Characterization of Temperature-Sensitive and -Insensitive, Recombination-Deficient Alleles in Drosophila",17246234,,"The procedure for the selection of a temperature-sensitive recombination mutant in Drosophila is described. Use of this procedure has led to the recovery of three alleles at a new recombination locus called rec-1, located within the region of chromosome 3 circumscribed by Deficiency (3R)sbd(105). One allele, rec-1(26), is temperature sensitive, and the other two alleles, rec-1(6) and rec-1(16), are temperature insensitive. Gene dosage studies reveal rec-1(26) to be a leaky mutant with greater recombination activity in two doses than in one. The other two alleles show no dose response, implying that they may be null mutants. The temperature response curves of rec-1(26) as a homozygote and in heteroallelic combination with rec-1(16) suggest that the sharp decrease in recombination between 28 degrees and 31 degrees indicates temperature denaturation of an enzyme or other protein specified by the mutant and associated with the recombination process. The ability of small changes in temperature to reverse or abolish polarity in recombination along the X chromosome arm in rec-1( 26)/rec-1(16) females brings into question the use of the ""polarity"" criterion to partition mutants into two functional types, i.e., precondition mutants that display polarity and exchange mutants that do not. Evidence that rec-1 may be part of a complex locus residing in a chromosome segment harboring a variety of recombination-related genes is presented.",1984,"R F Grell, R F Grell"
FACTORS AFFECTING THE INTRACELLULAR SYNTHESIS OF KYNURENINE,14154493,10.1083/jcb.21.1.27,"Near the time of pupation, autofluorescent kynurenine globules appear in the cells in the anterior region of the fatbody of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been reported previously that kynurenine synthesis may be induced in an additional group of fat cells by feeding the precursor tryptophan to Drosophila larvae, and that this induction of kynurenine production viewed within the fat cells is correlated with an increase in tryptophan pyrrolase activity. In the present report, conditions are outlined which result in the appearance of kynurenine in all of the fat cells. The number of cells in the fatbody which contain kynurenine is influenced by the quantity of tryptophan included in the diet, as well as by the developmental stage at the time of treatment and the duration of the feeding period on the inducer. Physical barriers modifying permeability, such as the membranous layer noted surrounding the fatbody, may be a factor in the regulation of the time and nature of the cellular induction of kynurenine synthesis. Another factor to be considered is the possibility of interference with the availability of tryptophan as a substrate or inducer for this synthesis within the cell. It is suggested that the occurrence of pteridines in some of the fat cells may modify the response of these cells to produce kynurenine, since pteridines as electron acceptors can complex with tryptophan as an electron donor. Kynurenine may be produced in the fat cells under in vitro conditions when they are incubated with L-tryptophan, but kynurenine is not formed when fat cells are incubated with D-tryptophan. The in vitro studies further demonstrate that induction of kynurenine synthesis may occur in fat cells isolated from young larvae in contrast, to in vivo conditions in which inducer does not effect an earlier appearance of kynurenine in the larval fatbody.",1964,"T M RIZKI, R M RIZKI, T M RIZKI, R M RIZKI"
Lithium-Responsive Seizure-Like Hyperexcitability Is Caused by a Mutation in the Drosophila Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Gene paralytic,27844061,10.1523/ENEURO.0221-16.2016,"Shudderer (Shu) is an X-linked dominant mutation in Drosophila melanogaster identified more than 40 years ago. A previous study showed that Shu caused spontaneous tremors and defects in reactive climbing behavior, and that these phenotypes were significantly suppressed when mutants were fed food containing lithium, a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder (Williamson, 1982). This unique observation suggested that the Shu mutation affects genes involved in lithium-responsive neurobiological processes. In the present study, we identified Shu as a novel mutant allele of the voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channel gene paralytic (para). Given that hypomorphic para alleles and RNA interference-mediated para knockdown reduced the severity of Shu phenotypes, Shu was classified as a para hypermorphic allele. We also demonstrated that lithium could improve the behavioral abnormalities displayed by other Nav mutants, including a fly model of the human generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus. Our electrophysiological analysis of Shu showed that lithium treatment did not acutely suppress Nav channel activity, indicating that the rescue effect of lithium resulted from chronic physiological adjustments to this drug. Microarray analysis revealed that lithium significantly alters the expression of various genes in Shu, including those involved in innate immune responses, amino acid metabolism, and oxidation-reduction processes, raising the interesting possibility that lithium-induced modulation of these biological pathways may contribute to such adjustments. Overall, our findings demonstrate that Nav channel mutants in Drosophila are valuable genetic tools for elucidating the effects of lithium on the nervous system in the context of neurophysiology and behavior.",2016,"Garrett A Kaas, Junko Kasuya, Patrick Lansdon, Atsushi Ueda, Atulya Iyengar, Chun-Fang Wu, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Garrett A Kaas, Junko Kasuya, Patrick Lansdon, Atsushi Ueda, Atulya Iyengar, Chun-Fang Wu, Toshihiro Kitamoto"
In vivo function and comparative genomic analyses of the Drosophila gut microbiota identify candidate symbiosis factors,25408687,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00576,"Symbiosis is often characterized by co-evolutionary changes in the genomes of the partners involved. An understanding of these changes can provide insight into the nature of the relationship, including the mechanisms that initiate and maintain an association between organisms. In this study we examined the genome sequences of bacteria isolated from the Drosophila melanogaster gut with the objective of identifying genes that are important for function in the host. We compared microbiota isolates with con-specific or closely related bacterial species isolated from non-fly environments. First the phenotype of germ-free Drosophila (axenic flies) was compared to that of flies colonized with specific bacteria (gnotobiotic flies) as a measure of symbiotic function. Non-fly isolates were functionally distinct from bacteria isolated from flies, conferring slower development and an altered nutrient profile in the host, traits known to be microbiota-dependent. Comparative genomic methods were next employed to identify putative symbiosis factors: genes found in bacteria that restore microbiota-dependent traits to gnotobiotic flies, but absent from those that do not. Factors identified include riboflavin synthesis and stress resistance. We also used a phylogenomic approach to identify protein coding genes for which fly-isolate sequences were more similar to each other than to other sequences, reasoning that these genes may have a shared function unique to the fly environment. This method identified genes in Acetobacter species that cluster in two distinct genomic loci: one predicted to be involved in oxidative stress detoxification and another encoding an efflux pump. In summary, we leveraged genomic and in vivo functional comparisons to identify candidate traits that distinguish symbiotic bacteria. These candidates can serve as the basis for further work investigating the genetic requirements of bacteria for function and persistence in the Drosophila gut.",2014,"Peter D Newell, John M Chaston, Yiping Wang, Nathan J Winans, David R Sannino, Adam C N Wong, Adam J Dobson, Jeanne Kagle, Angela E Douglas, Peter D Newell, John M Chaston, Yiping Wang, Nathan J Winans, David R Sannino, Adam C N Wong, Adam J Dobson, Jeanne Kagle, Angela E Douglas"
Contrasting influences of Drosophila white/mini-white on ethanol sensitivity in two different behavioral assays,24890118,10.1111/acer.12421,"Background:
      
    

    
      The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used extensively to investigate genetic mechanisms of ethanol (EtOH)-related behaviors. Many past studies in flies, including studies from our laboratory, have manipulated gene expression using transposons carrying the genetic-phenotypic marker mini-white(mini-w), a derivative of the endogenous gene white(w). Whether the mini-w transgenic marker or the endogenous w gene influences behavioral responses to acute EtOH exposure in flies has not been systematically investigated.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We manipulated mini-w and w expression via (i) transposons marked with mini-w, (ii) RNAi against mini-w and w, and (iii) a null allele of w. We assessed EtOH sensitivity and tolerance using a previously described eRING assay (based on climbing in the presence of EtOH) and an assay based on EtOH-induced sedation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      In eRING assays, EtOH-induced impairment of climbing correlated inversely with expression of the mini-w marker from a series of transposon insertions. Additionally, flies harboring a null allele of w or flies with RNAi-mediated knockdown of mini-w were significantly more sensitive to EtOH in eRING assays than controls expressing endogenous w or the mini-w marker. In contrast, EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance measured in the EtOH sedation assay were not affected by decreased expression of mini-w or endogenous w in flies.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      EtOH sensitivity measured in the eRING assay is noticeably influenced by w and mini-w, making eRING problematic for studies on EtOH-related behavior in Drosophila using transgenes marked with mini-w. In contrast, the EtOH sensitivity assay described here is a suitable behavioral paradigm for studies on EtOH sensitivity and rapid tolerance in Drosophila including those that use widely available transgenes marked with mini-w.",2014,"Robin F Chan, Lara Lewellyn, Jacqueline M DeLoyht, Kristyn Sennett, Scarlett Coffman, Matthew Hewitt, Jill C Bettinger, John M Warrick, Mike Grotewiel, Robin F Chan, Lara Lewellyn, Jacqueline M DeLoyht, Kristyn Sennett, Scarlett Coffman, Matthew Hewitt, Jill C Bettinger, John M Warrick, Mike Grotewiel"
"A Drosophila protease cascade member, seminal metalloprotease-1, is activated stepwise by male factors and requires female factors for full activity",24514904,10.1534/genetics.113.160101,"Females and males of sexually reproducing animals must cooperate at the molecular and cellular level for fertilization to succeed, even though some aspects of reproductive molecular biology appear to involve antagonistic interactions. We previously reported the existence of a proteolytic cascade in Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid that is initiated in the male and ends in the female. This proteolytic cascade, which processes at least two seminal fluid proteins (Sfps), is a useful model for understanding the regulation of Sfp activities, including proteolysis cascades in mammals. Here, we investigated the activation mechanism of the downstream protease in the cascade, the astacin-family metalloprotease Seminal metalloprotease-1 (Semp1, CG11864), focusing on the relative contribution of the male and female to its activation. We identified a naturally occurring semp1 null mutation within the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. By expressing mutant forms of Semp1 in males homozygous for the null mutation, we discovered that cleavage is required for the complete activation of Semp1, and we defined at least two sites that are essential for this activational cleavage. These amino acid residues suggest a two-step mechanism for Semp1 activation, involving the action of at least two male-derived proteases. Although the cascade's substrates potentially influence both fertility and sperm competition within the mated female, the role of female factors in the activation or activity of Semp1 is unknown. We show here that Semp1 can undergo its activational cleavage in male ejaculates, without female contributions, but that cleavage of Semp1's substrates does not proceed to completion in ejaculates, indicating an essential role for female factors in Semp1's full activity. In addition, we find that expression of Semp1 in virgin females demonstrates that females can activate this protease on their own, resulting in activity that is complete but substantially delayed.",2014,"Brooke A Laflamme, Frank W Avila, Kevin Michalski, Mariana F Wolfner, Brooke A Laflamme, Frank W Avila, Kevin Michalski, Mariana F Wolfner"
Ecdysone signaling and transcript signature in Drosophila cells resistant against methoxyfenozide,20816975,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.08.022,"Methoxyfenozide (RH-2485) is a non-steroidal ecdysteroid agonist with a dibenzoylhydrazine structure, representing a group used as novel biorational insecticides in the control of insect pests. Here we report on the selection of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells for resistance to inhibition of cell proliferation by methoxyfenozide by ∼ 1000-fold over 4 months. Cells were exposed to gradually increasing concentrations of methoxyfenozide and selected out based on the ecdysteroid-sensitive response for cell proliferation. In the resistant cells, the ecdysteroid receptor (EcR/USP) complex was no longer active in the presence of methoxyfenozide. But when resistant cells were relaxed from pressure in methoxyfenozide-free medium, induction of the reporter construct was observed. In parallel, EcR/USP functionality was also restored when resistant cells were rescued by a Drosophila EcR plasmid. However, it was striking that in the resistant cells the ecdysteroid-sensitive response for cell proliferation was not restored upon methoxyfenozide withdrawal, indicating permanent changes in the physiology of the cells during selection. To investigate changes in gene expression caused by inactivation of the EcR/USP complex in resistant cells, Drosophila oligo 14kv1 microarrays were used and probed with cDNAs from resistant cells in the presence and absence of ecdysone agonist on one hand and from unselected sensitive cells on the other hand. A selection of 324 differentially expressed genes was assigned covering diverse functions as transport, enzyme activity, cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle machinery, transcription/translation and ecdysteroid signaling.

Identification of N-glycosylated proteins from the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster,17893096,10.1093/glycob/cwm097,"Although the function of many glycoproteins in the nervous system of fruit flies is well understood, information about the glycosylation profile and glycan attachment sites for such proteins is scarce. In order to fill this gap and to facilitate the analysis of N-linked glycosylation in the nervous system, we have performed an extensive survey of membrane-associated glycoproteins and their N-glycosylation sites isolated from the adult Drosophila brain. Following subcellular fractionation and trypsin digestion, we used different lectin affinity chromatography steps to isolate N-glycosylated glycopeptides. We identified a total of 205 glycoproteins carrying N-linked glycans and revealed their 307 N-glycan attachment sites. The size of the resulting dataset furthermore allowed the statistical characterization of amino acid distribution around the N-linked glycosylation sites. Glycan profiles were analyzed separately for glycopeptides that were strongly and weakly bound to Concanavalin A (Con A), or that failed to bind Concanavalin A, but did bind to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). High- or paucimannosidic glycans dominated each of the profiles, although the wheat germ agglutinin-bound glycan population was enriched in more extensively processed structures. A sialylated glycan structure was unambiguously detected in the wheat germ agglutinin-bound fraction. Despite the large amount of starting material, insufficient amount of glycopeptides was retained by the Wisteria floribunda (WFA) and Sambucus nigra columns to allow glycan or glycoprotein identification, providing further evidence that the vast majority of glycoproteins in the adult Drosophila brain carry primarily high-mannose, paucimannose, and hybrid glycans. The obtained results should facilitate future genetic and molecular approaches addressing the role of N-glycosylation in the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila.",2007,"Kate Koles, Jae-Min Lim, Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Michael Tiemeyer, Lance Wells, Vlad Panin, Kate Koles, Jae-Min Lim, Kazuhiro Aoki, Mindy Porterfield, Michael Tiemeyer, Lance Wells, Vlad Panin"
An unconventional myosin heavy chain gene from Drosophila melanogaster,1429838,10.1083/jcb.119.4.823,"As part of a study of cytoskeletal proteins involved in Drosophila embryonic development, we have undertaken the molecular analysis of a 140-kD ATP-sensitive actin-binding protein (Miller, K. G., C. M. Field, and B. M. Alberts. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 109:2963-2975). Analysis of cDNA clones encoding this protein revealed that it represents a new class of unconventional myosin heavy chains. The amino-terminal two thirds of the protein comprises a head domain that is 29-33% identical (60-65% similar) to other myosin heads, and contains ATP-binding, actin-binding and calmodulin/myosin light chain-binding motifs. The carboxy-terminal tail has no significant similarity to other known myosin tails, but does contain a approximately 100-amino acid region that is predicted to form an alpha-helical coiled-coil. Since the unique gene that encodes this protein maps to the polytene map position 95F, we have named the new gene Drosophila 95F myosin heavy chain (95F MHC). The expression profile of the 95F MHC gene is complex. Examination of multiple cDNAs reveals that transcripts are alternatively spliced and encode at least three protein isoforms; in addition, a fourth isoform is detected on Western blots. Developmental Northern and Western blots show that transcripts and protein are present throughout the life cycle, with peak expression occurring during mid-embryogenesis and adulthood. Immunolocalization in early embryos demonstrates that the protein is primarily located in a punctate pattern throughout the peripheral cytoplasm. Most cells maintain a low level of protein expression throughout embryogenesis, but specific tissues appear to contain more protein. We speculate that the 95F MHC protein isoforms are involved in multiple dynamic processes during Drosophila development.",1992,"K A Kellerman, K G Miller, K A Kellerman, K G Miller"
L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia in a Genetic Drosophila Model of Parkinson's Disease,32921640,10.5607/en20028,"Motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are directly related to the reduction of a neurotransmitter dopamine. Therefore, its precursor L-DOPA became the gold standard for PD treatment. However, chronic use of L-DOPA causes uncontrollable, involuntary movements, called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in the majority of PD patients. LID is complicated and very difficult to manage. Current rodent and non-human primate models have been developed to study LID mainly using neurotoxins. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a LID animal model with defects in genetic factors causing PD in order to study the relation between LID and PD genes such as α-synuclein. In this study, we first showed that a low concentration of L-DOPA (100 μM) rescues locomotion defects (i.e., speed, angular velocity, pause time) in Drosophila larvae expressing human mutant α-synuclein (A53T). This A53T larval model of PD was used to further examine dyskinetic behaviors. High concentrations of L-DOPA (5 or 10 mM) causes hyperactivity such as body bending behavior (BBB) in A53T larva, which resembles axial dyskinesia in rodents. Using ImageJ plugins and other third party software, dyskinetic BBB has been accurately and efficiently quantified. Further, we showed that a dopamine agonist pramipexole (PRX) partially rescues BBB caused by high L-DOPA. Our Drosophila genetic LID model will provide an important experimental platform to examine molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LID, to study the role of PD causing genes in the development of LID, and to identify potential targets to slow/reverse LID pathology.",2020,"Joshua A Blosser, Eric Podolsky, Daewoo Lee, Joshua A Blosser, Eric Podolsky, Daewoo Lee"
"Drosophila as a Model to Study the Relationship Between Sleep, Plasticity, and Memory",32547415,10.3389/fphys.2020.00533,"Humans spend nearly a third of their life sleeping, yet, despite decades of research the function of sleep still remains a mystery. Sleep has been linked with various biological systems and functions, including metabolism, immunity, the cardiovascular system, and cognitive functions. Importantly, sleep appears to be present throughout the animal kingdom suggesting that it must provide an evolutionary advantage. Among the many possible functions of sleep, the relationship between sleep, and cognition has received a lot of support. We have all experienced the negative cognitive effects associated with a night of sleep deprivation. These can include increased emotional reactivity, poor judgment, deficit in attention, impairment in learning and memory, and obviously increase in daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, many neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease often have a sleep disorder component. In some cases, the sleep disorder can exacerbate the progression of the neurological disease. Thus, it is clear that sleep plays an important role for many brain functions. In particular, sleep has been shown to play a positive role in the consolidation of long-term memory while sleep deprivation negatively impacts learning and memory. Importantly, sleep is a behavior that is adapted to an individual's need and influenced by many external and internal stimuli. In addition to being an adaptive behavior, sleep can also modulate plasticity in the brain at the level of synaptic connections between neurons and neuronal plasticity influences sleep. Understanding how sleep is modulated by internal and external stimuli and how sleep can modulate memory and plasticity is a key question in neuroscience. In order to address this question, several animal models have been developed. Among them, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with its unparalleled genetics has proved to be extremely valuable. In addition to sleep, Drosophila has been shown to be an excellent model to study many complex behaviors, including learning, and memory.

Structure-Function Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster Caudal Transcription Factor Provides Insights into Core Promoter-preferential Activation,26018075,10.1074/jbc.M114.632109,"Regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription is critical for the proper development, differentiation, and growth of an organism. The RNA polymerase II core promoter is the ultimate target of a multitude of transcription factors that control transcription initiation. Core promoters encompass the RNA start site and consist of functional elements such as the TATA box, initiator, and downstream core promoter element (DPE), which confer specific properties to the core promoter. We have previously discovered that Drosophila Caudal, which is a master regulator of genes involved in development and differentiation, is a DPE-specific transcriptional activator. Here, we show that the mouse Caudal-related homeobox (Cdx) proteins (mCdx1, mCdx2, and mCdx4) are also preferential core promoter transcriptional activators. To elucidate the mechanism that enables Caudal to preferentially activate DPE transcription, we performed structure-function analysis. Using a systematic series of deletion mutants (all containing the intact DNA-binding homeodomain) we discovered that the C-terminal region of Caudal contributes to the preferential activation of the fushi tarazu (ftz) Caudal target gene. Furthermore, the region containing both the homeodomain and the C terminus of Caudal was sufficient to confer core promoter-preferential activation to the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Importantly, we discovered that Drosophila CREB-binding protein (dCBP) is a co-activator for Caudal-regulated activation of ftz. Strikingly, dCBP conferred the ability to preferentially activate the DPE-dependent ftz reporter to mini-Caudal proteins that were unable to preferentially activate ftz transcription themselves. Taken together, it is the unique combination of dCBP and Caudal that enables the co-activation of ftz in a core promoter-preferential manner.",2015,"Hila Shir-Shapira, Julia Sharabany, Matan Filderman, Diana Ideses, Avital Ovadia-Shochat, Mattias Mannervik, Tamar Juven-Gershon, Hila Shir-Shapira, Julia Sharabany, Matan Filderman, Diana Ideses, Avital Ovadia-Shochat, Mattias Mannervik, Tamar Juven-Gershon"
A novel paradigm for nonassociative long-term memory in Drosophila: predator-induced changes in oviposition behavior,25633088,10.1534/genetics.114.172221,"Learning processes in Drosophila have been studied through the use of Pavlovian associative memory tests, and these paradigms have been extremely useful in identifying both genetic factors and neuroanatomical structures that are essential to memory formation. Whether these same genes and brain compartments also contribute to memory formed from nonassociative experiences is not well understood. Exposures to environmental stressors such as predators are known to induce innate behavioral responses and can lead to new memory formation that allows a predator response to persist for days after the predator threat has been removed. Here, we utilize a unique form of nonassociative behavior in Drosophila where female flies detect the presence of endoparasitoid predatory wasps and alter their oviposition behavior to lay eggs in food containing high levels of alcohol. The predator-induced change in fly oviposition preference is maintained for days after wasps are removed, and this persistence in behavior requires a minimum continuous exposure time of 14 hr. Maintenance of this behavior is dependent on multiple long-term memory genes, including orb2, dunce, rutabaga, amnesiac, and Fmr1. Maintenance of the behavior also requires intact synaptic transmission of the mushroom body. Surprisingly, synaptic output from the mushroom body (MB) or the functions of any of these learning and memory genes are not required for the change in behavior when female flies are in constant contact with wasps. This suggests that perception of this predator that leads to an acute change in oviposition behavior is not dependent on the MB or dependent on learning and memory gene functions. Because wasp-induced oviposition behavior can last for days and its maintenance requires a functional MB and the wild-type products of several known learning and memory genes, we suggest that this constitutes a paradigm for a bona fide form of nonassociative long-term memory that is not dependent on associated experiences.",2015,"Balint Z Kacsoh, Julianna Bozler, Sassan Hodge, Mani Ramaswami, Giovanni Bosco, Balint Z Kacsoh, Julianna Bozler, Sassan Hodge, Mani Ramaswami, Giovanni Bosco"
Automated annotation of developmental stages of Drosophila embryos in images containing spatial patterns of expression,24300439,10.1093/bioinformatics/btt648,"Motivation:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster is a major model organism for investigating the function and interconnection of animal genes in the earliest stages of embryogenesis. Today, images capturing Drosophila gene expression patterns are being produced at a higher throughput than ever before. The analysis of spatial patterns of gene expression is most biologically meaningful when images from a similar time point during development are compared. Thus, the critical first step is to determine the developmental stage of an embryo. This information is also needed to observe and analyze expression changes over developmental time. Currently, developmental stages (time) of embryos in images capturing spatial expression pattern are annotated manually, which is time- and labor-intensive. Embryos are often designated into stage ranges, making the information on developmental time course. This makes downstream analyses inefficient and biological interpretations of similarities and differences in spatial expression patterns challenging, particularly when using automated tools for analyzing expression patterns of large number of images.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here, we present a new computational approach to annotate developmental stage for Drosophila embryos in the gene expression images. In an analysis of 3724 images, the new approach shows high accuracy in predicting the developmental stage correctly (79%). In addition, it provides a stage score that enables one to more finely annotate each embryo so that they are divided into early and late periods of development within standard stage demarcations. Stage scores for all images containing expression patterns of the same gene enable a direct way to view expression changes over developmental time for any gene. We show that the genomewide-expression-maps generated using images from embryos in refined stages illuminate global gene activities and changes much better, and more refined stage annotations improve our ability to better interpret results when expression pattern matches are discovered between genes.

Development of a Drosophila cell-based error correction assay,23888285,10.3389/fonc.2013.00187,"Accurate transmission of the genome through cell division requires microtubules from opposing spindle poles to interact with protein super-structures called kinetochores that assemble on each sister chromatid. Most kinetochores establish erroneous attachments that are destabilized through a process called error correction. Failure to correct improper kinetochore-microtubule (kt-MT) interactions before anaphase onset results in chromosomal instability (CIN), which has been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor adaptation. Thus, it is important to characterize the molecular basis of error correction to better comprehend how CIN occurs and how it can be modulated. An error correction assay has been previously developed in cultured mammalian cells in which incorrect kt-MT attachments are created through the induction of monopolar spindle assembly via chemical inhibition of kinesin-5. Error correction is then monitored following inhibitor wash out. Implementing the error correction assay in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells would be valuable because kt-MT attachments are easily visualized and the cells are highly amenable to RNAi and high-throughput screening. However, Drosophila kinesin-5 (Klp61F) is unaffected by available small molecule inhibitors. To overcome this limitation, we have rendered S2 cells susceptible to kinesin-5 inhibitors by functionally replacing Klp61F with human kinesin-5 (Eg5). Eg5 expression rescued the assembly of monopolar spindles typically caused by Klp61F depletion. Eg5-mediated bipoles collapsed into monopoles due, in part, to kinesin-14 (Ncd) activity when treated with the kinesin-5 inhibitor S-trityl-L-cysteine (STLC). Furthermore, bipolar spindles reassembled and error correction was observed after STLC wash out. Importantly, error correction in Eg5-expressing S2 cells was dependent on the well-established error correction kinase Aurora B. This system provides a powerful new cell-based platform for studying error correction and CIN.",2013,"Jeffrey D Salemi, Philip T McGilvray, Thomas J Maresca, Jeffrey D Salemi, Philip T McGilvray, Thomas J Maresca"
Loss-of-Function Screen Reveals Novel Regulators Required for Drosophila Germline Stem Cell Self-Renewal,22413088,10.1534/g3.111.001651,"The germline stem cells (GSCs) of Drosophila melanogaster ovary provide an excellent model system to study the molecular mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. To reveal novel factors required for Drosophila female GSC maintenance and/or division, we performed a loss-of-function screen in GSCs by using a collection of P-element-induced alleles of essential genes. Mutations in genes of various functional groups were identified to cause defects in GSC self-renewal. Here we report that a group of mutations affecting various ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes cause significant GSCs loss, including Plenty of SH3s (POSH), Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 10 (UbcD10), and pineapple eye (pie). Ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation plays a variety of roles in the regulation of many developmental processes, including mediating stem cell division through degradation of cell cycle regulators. We demonstrated that pie, sharing highly conserved RING domains with human E3 ubiquitin ligase G2E3 that are critical for early embryonic development, is specifically required for GSC maintenance, possibly through regulation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. Despite the previously reported role in imaginal disc cell survival, pie loss-of-function induced GSC loss is not to the result of caspase-involved cell death. Further efforts are needed to elucidate the functions of ubiquitin ligases in GSC maintenance, which will ultimately contribute to a better understanding of how the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes regulate stem cell biology in mammalian systems.",2012,"Yalan Xing, Irina Kurtz, Manisha Thuparani, Jillian Legard, Hannele Ruohola-Baker, Yalan Xing, Irina Kurtz, Manisha Thuparani, Jillian Legard, Hannele Ruohola-Baker"
Genetic control of acute ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila,10968649,,"Background:
      
    

    
      In most organisms in which acute ethanol exposure has been studied, it leads to similar changes in behavior. Generally, low ethanol doses activate the central nervous system, whereas high doses are sedative. Sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of ethanol is in part under genetic control in rodents and humans, and reduced sensitivity in humans predicts the development of alcoholism (Crabbe et al., 1994; Schuckit, 1994). We have established Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study the mechanisms that regulate acute sensitivity to ethanol.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured the effects of ethanol vapor on Drosophila locomotor behaviors by using three different assays. Horizontal locomotion was quantified in a locomotor chamber, turning behavior was assayed in narrow tubes, and ethanol-induced loss of postural control was measured in an inebriometer. Mutants with altered sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol were generated by treatment with ethyl methane sulfonate and isolated by selection in the inebriometer. We ascertained the effects of these mutations on ethanol pharmacokinetics by measuring ethanol levels in extracts of flies at various times during and after ethanol exposure.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Among nearly 30,000 potentially mutant flies tested, we isolated 19 mutant strains with reduced and 4 strains with increased sensitivity to the acute effects of ethanol as measured in the inebriometer. Of these mutants, four showed changes in ethanol absorption. Two mutants, named barfly and tipsy to reflect their reduced and increased ethanol sensitivity in the inebriometer, respectively, were analyzed for locomotor behaviors. Both mutants exhibited ethanol-induced hyperactivity that was indistinguishable from wild type. However, barfly and tipsy displayed reduced and increased sensitivity to the sedative effects of ethanol, respectively. Finally, both mutants showed an increased rate of ethanol-induced turning behavior.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The effects of acute ethanol exposure on Drosophila locomotor behaviors are remarkably similar to those described for mammals. The analysis of mutants with altered sensitivity to ethanol revealed that the genetic pathways which regulate these responses are complex and that single genes can affect hyperactivity, turning, and sedation independently.",2000,"C M Singh, U Heberlein, C M Singh, U Heberlein"
The Drosophila suppressor of sable protein binds to RNA and associates with a subset of polytene chromosome bands,9121479,10.1128/mcb.17.4.2291,"Mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster suppressor of sable [su(s)] gene, which encodes a 150-kDa nuclear protein [Su(s)], increase the accumulation of specific transcripts in a manner that is not well understood but that appears to involve pre-mRNA processing. Here, we report biochemical analysis of purified, recombinant Su(s) [rSu(s)] expressed in baculovirus and in Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions and immunocytochemical analysis of endogenous Su(s). This work has shown that purified, baculovirus-expressed rSu(s) binds to RNA in vitro with a high affinity and limited specificity. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment was used to identify preferred RNA targets of rSu(s), and a large proportion of RNAs isolated contain a full or partial match to the consensus sequence UCAGUAGUCU, which was confirmed to be a high-affinity rSu(s) binding site. An MBP-Su(s) fusion protein containing the N-terminal third of Su(s) binds RNAs containing this sequence with a higher specificity than full-length, baculovirus-expressed rSu(s). The consensus sequence resembles both a cryptic 5' splice site and a sequence that is found near the 5' end of some Drosophila transcripts. Immunolocalization studies showed that endogenous Su(s) is distributed in a reticulated pattern in Drosophila embryo and salivary gland nuclei. In salivary gland cells, Su(s) is found both in the nucleoplasm and in association with a subset of polytene chromosome bands. Considering these and previous results, we propose two models to explain how su(s) mutations affect nuclear pre-mRNA processing.",1997,"M V Murray, M A Turnage, K J Williamson, W R Steinhauer, L L Searles, M V Murray, M A Turnage, K J Williamson, W R Steinhauer, L L Searles"
A 130 kDa polypeptide immunologically related to the 180 kDa catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex is detected in early embryos of Drosophila,7592543,10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a124780,"An immunocytochemical method using specific antibodies was employed to detect DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex in Drosophila melanogaster embryos during the first 13 nuclear division cycles. A monoclonal antibody specific to the 72 kDa polypeptide stained interphase nuclei, but not metaphase chromosome, while at late anaphase and thereafter staining of the chromosome was regained. On the other hand, a polyclonal antibody specific to the 180 kDa polypeptide stained not only the interphase nuclei but also the cytoplasmic regions surrounding interphase nuclei. These results suggest that the distributions of the 180 kDa and the 72 kDa polypeptides of DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex are different. We detected the 180 kDa and the 72 kDa polypeptides in the extract prepared from a single Drosophila embryo by Western blotting, and a 130 kDa polypeptide immunologically related to the 180 kDa polypeptide was also detected in the extract. These polypeptides (180, 130, and 72 kDa) in the embryos were detected at similar levels at interphase and at the mitotic phase. These three polypeptides were also detected in unfertilized eggs, showing that they were maternally stored. The 130 kDa polypeptide was detected till cycle 10, then began to decrease, and finally disappeared at cycle 14, whereas the 180 kDa and the 72 kDa polypeptides were present without marked fluctuation in quantity throughout the developmental stages. Even in unfertilized eggs, the level of the 130 kDa polypeptide decreased gradually with a similar time course to that in fertilized ones, but the levels of the 180 kDa and the 72 kDa polypeptides remained unchanged. This is the first report suggesting the existence of the 130 kDa polypeptide in vivo in the early embryos of Drosophila. The significance of the 130 kDa polypeptide is discussed.",1995,"K Kuroda, R Ueda, K Kuroda, R Ueda"
Hyd ubiquitinates the NF-κB co-factor Akirin to operate an effective immune response in Drosophila,32339205,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008458,"The Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathway in Drosophila melanogaster is activated upon microbial challenge with Gram-negative bacteria to trigger the innate immune response. In order to decipher this nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, we undertook an in vitro RNAi screen targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases specifically and identified the HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Hyperplastic discs (Hyd) as a new actor in the IMD pathway. Hyd mediated Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of the NF-κB cofactor Akirin was required for efficient binding of Akirin to the NF-κB transcription factor Relish. We showed that this Hyd-dependent interaction was required for the transcription of immunity-related genes that are activated by both Relish and Akirin but was dispensable for the transcription of genes that depend solely on Relish. Therefore Hyd is key in NF-κB transcriptional selectivity downstream of the IMD pathway. Drosophila depleted of Akirin or Hyd failed to express the full set of genes encoding immune-induced anti-microbial peptides and succumbed to immune challenges. We showed further that UBR5, the mammalian homolog of Hyd, was also required downstream of the NF-κB pathway for the activation of Interleukin 6 (IL6) transcription by LPS or IL-1β in cultured human cells. Our findings link the action of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to the activation of immune effector genes, deepening our understanding of the involvement of ubiquitination in inflammation and identifying a potential target for the control of inflammatory diseases.",2020,"Alexandre Cammarata-Mouchtouris, Xuan-Hung Nguyen, Adrian Acker, François Bonnay, Akira Goto, Amir Orian, Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Michael Boutros, Jean-Marc Reichhart, Nicolas Matt, Alexandre Cammarata-Mouchtouris, Xuan-Hung Nguyen, Adrian Acker, François Bonnay, Akira Goto, Amir Orian, Marie-Odile Fauvarque, Michael Boutros, Jean-Marc Reichhart, Nicolas Matt"
TDP-43 promotes the formation of neuromuscular synapses through the regulation of Disc-large expression in Drosophila skeletal muscles,32216790,10.1186/s12915-020-00767-7,"Background:
      
    

    
      The ribonuclear protein TDP-43 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with genetic mutations being linked to the neurological symptoms of the disease. Though alterations in the intracellular distribution of TDP-43 have been observed in skeletal muscles of patients suffering from ALS, it is not clear whether such modifications play an active role in the disease or merely represent an expression of muscle homeostatic mechanisms. Also, the molecular and metabolic pathways regulated by TDP-43 in the skeletal muscle remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze the function of TBPH, the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of TDP-43, in skeletal muscles.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We modulated the activity of TDP-43 in Drosophila muscles by means of RNA interference and observed that it is required to promote the formation and growth of neuromuscular synapses. TDP-43 regulated the expression levels of Disc-large (Dlg), and restoring Dlg expression either in skeletal muscles or in motoneurons was sufficient to suppress the locomotive and synaptic defects of TDP-43-null flies. These results were validated by the observation of a decrease in Dlg levels in human neuroblastoma cells and iPSC-differentiated motoneurons derived from ALS patients, suggesting similar mechanisms may potentially be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease.

Live applications of norbormide-based fluorescent probes in Drosophila melanogaster,30958824,10.1371/journal.pone.0211169,"In this study we investigated the performance of two norbormide (NRB)-derived fluorescent probes, NRBMC009 (green) and NRBZLW0047 (red), on dissected, living larvae of Drosophila, to verify their potential application in live cell imaging confocal microscopy. To this end, larval tissues were exposed to NRB probes alone or in combination with other commercial dyes or GFP-tagged protein markers. Both probes were rapidly internalized by most tissues (except the central nervous system) allowing each organ in the microscope field to be readily distinguished at low magnification. At the cellular level, the probes showed a very similar distribution (except for fat bodies), defined by loss of signal in the nucleus and plasma membrane, and a preferential localization to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. They also recognized ER and mitochondrial phenotypes in the skeletal muscles of fruit fly models that had loss of function mutations in the atlastin and mitofusin genes, suggesting NRBMC009 and NRBZLW0047 as potentially useful screening tools for characterizing ER and mitochondria morphological alterations. Feeding of larvae and adult Drosophilae with the NRB-derived dyes led to staining of the gut and its epithelial cells, revealing a potential role in food intake assays. In addition, when flies were exposed to either dye over their entire life cycle no apparent functional or morphological abnormalities were detected. Rapid internalization, a bright signal, a compatibility with other available fluorescent probes and GFP-tagged protein markers, and a lack of toxicity make NRBZLW0047 and, particularly, NRBMC009 highly performing fluorescent probes for live cell microscopy studies and food intake assays in Drosophila.",2019,"Alessia Forgiarini, Zifei Wang, Claudio D'Amore, Morgan Jay-Smith, Freda Fan Li, Brian Hopkins, Margaret Anne Brimble, Andrea Pagetta, Sara Bersani, Sara De Martin, Barbara Napoli, Sergio Bova, David Rennison, Genny Orso, Alessia Forgiarini, Zifei Wang, Claudio D'Amore, Morgan Jay-Smith, Freda Fan Li, Brian Hopkins, Margaret Anne Brimble, Andrea Pagetta, Sara Bersani, Sara De Martin, Barbara Napoli, Sergio Bova, David Rennison, Genny Orso"
Exploiting regulatory heterogeneity to systematically identify enhancers with high accuracy,30598455,10.1073/pnas.1808833115,"Identifying functional enhancer elements in metazoan systems is a major challenge. Large-scale validation of enhancers predicted by ENCODE reveal false-positive rates of at least 70%. We used the pregrastrula-patterning network of Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate that loss in accuracy in held-out data results from heterogeneity of functional signatures in enhancer elements. We show that at least two classes of enhancers are active during early Drosophila embryogenesis and that by focusing on a single, relatively homogeneous class of elements, greater than 98% prediction accuracy can be achieved in a balanced, completely held-out test set. The class of well-predicted elements is composed predominantly of enhancers driving multistage segmentation patterns, which we designate segmentation driving enhancers (SDE). Prediction is driven by the DNA occupancy of early developmental transcription factors, with almost no additional power derived from histone modifications. We further show that improved accuracy is not a property of a particular prediction method: after conditioning on the SDE set, naïve Bayes and logistic regression perform as well as more sophisticated tools. Applying this method to a genome-wide scan, we predict 1,640 SDEs that cover 1.6% of the genome. An analysis of 32 SDEs using whole-mount embryonic imaging of stably integrated reporter constructs chosen throughout our prediction rank-list showed >90% drove expression patterns.

Evolution of longevity improves immunity in Drosophila,30564440,10.1002/evl3.89,"Much has been learned about the genetics of aging from studies in model organisms, but still little is known about naturally occurring alleles that contribute to variation in longevity. For example, analysis of mutants and transgenes has identified insulin signaling as a major regulator of longevity, yet whether standing variation in this pathway underlies microevolutionary changes in lifespan and correlated fitness traits remains largely unclear. Here, we have analyzed the genomes of a set of Drosophila melanogaster lines that have been maintained under direct selection for postponed reproduction and indirect selection for longevity, relative to unselected control lines, for over 35 years. We identified many candidate loci shaped by selection for longevity and late-life fertility, but - contrary to expectation - we did not find overrepresentation of canonical longevity genes. Instead, we found an enrichment of immunity genes, particularly in the Toll pathway, suggesting that evolutionary changes in immune function might underpin - in part - the evolution of late-life fertility and longevity. To test whether this genomic signature is causative, we performed functional experiments. In contrast to control flies, long-lived flies tended to downregulate the expression of antimicrobial peptides upon infection with age yet survived fungal, bacterial, and viral infections significantly better, consistent with alleviated immunosenescence. To examine whether genes of the Toll pathway directly affect longevity, we employed conditional knockdown using in vivo RNAi. In adults, RNAi against the Toll receptor extended lifespan, whereas silencing the pathway antagonist cactus--causing immune hyperactivation - dramatically shortened lifespan. Together, our results suggest that genetic changes in the age-dependent regulation of immune homeostasis might contribute to the evolution of longer life.",2018,"Daniel K Fabian, Kathrin Garschall, Peter Klepsatel, Gonçalo Santos-Matos, Élio Sucena, Martin Kapun, Bruno Lemaitre, Christian Schlötterer, Robert Arking, Thomas Flatt, Daniel K Fabian, Kathrin Garschall, Peter Klepsatel, Gonçalo Santos-Matos, Élio Sucena, Martin Kapun, Bruno Lemaitre, Christian Schlötterer, Robert Arking, Thomas Flatt"
Grape skin extract improves muscle function and extends lifespan of a Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease through activation of mitophagy,30248358,10.1016/j.exger.2018.09.014,"Recent studies suggest that moderate red wine consumption may confer several health benefits, including protection against heart disease, certain cancers and multiple age-related neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These health benefits are assumed to come from a compound from grape skin called resveratrol, which has been proposed to be a pro-longevity agent. Whether resveratrol accounts for all the health benefits of grape-derived nutrients and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of such nutrients are not well understood. Here we investigated the effect of supplementing grape skin extract (GSE) left from red wine-production process to the daily food intake of a Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) loss-of-function. Consumption of GSE resulted in rescue of mitochondrial morphological defects, improvement of indirect flight muscle function and health-span, and prolonged lifespan of the PINK1 mutant flies. Further biochemical and genetic studies revealed a link between activation of mitophagy and the beneficial effects of GSE.

Nutrition Influences Caffeine-Mediated Sleep Loss in Drosophila,29029291,10.1093/sleep/zsx146,"Study objectives:
      
    

    
      Plant-derived caffeine is regarded as a defensive compound produced to prevent herbivory. Caffeine is generally repellent to insects and often used to study the neurological basis for aversive responses in the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster. Caffeine is also studied for its stimulatory properties where sleep or drowsiness is suppressed across a range of species. Since limiting access to food also inhibits fly sleep-an effect known as starvation-induced sleep suppression-we tested whether aversion to caffeinated food results in reduced nutrient intake and assessed how this might influence fly studies on the stimulatory effects of caffeine.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We measured sleep and total consumption during the first 24 hours of exposure to caffeinated diets containing a range of sucrose concentrations to determine the relative influence of caffeine and nutrient ingestion on sleep. Experiments were replicated using three fly strains.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Caffeine reduced total consumption and nighttime sleep, but only at intermediate sucrose concentrations. Although sleep can be modeled by an exponential dose response to nutrient intake, caffeine-mediated sleep loss cannot be explained by absolute caffeine or sucrose ingestion alone. Instead, reduced sleep strongly correlates with changes in total consumption due to caffeine. Other bitter compounds phenocopy the effect of caffeine on sleep and food intake.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:

Pyroglutamate-amyloid-β peptide expression in Drosophila leads to caspase-dependent and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related progressive neurodegeneration,28973191,10.1093/hmg/ddx346,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. During the progression of AD, massive neuronal degeneration occurs in the late stage of the disease; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this neuronal loss remain unknown. AβpE3-42 (an N-terminal-truncated amyloid-β peptide that begins with pyroglutamate at the third position) is produced during late-stage AD. It also aggregates more rapidly in vitro and exhibits greater toxicity in neurons than full-length Aβ1-42. In the present study, we established a Drosophila melanogaster model that expresses Aβ3-42E3Q, which effectively produces AβpE3-42, and investigated the function of AβpE3-42 using the photoreceptor neurons of Drosophila. AβpE3-42 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and caused progressive degeneration in photoreceptor neurons. Mutations in ER stress response genes or the administration of an inhibitor of the ER stress response markedly suppressed the degeneration phenotype, suggesting that the ER stress response plays an important role in neurodegeneration caused by AβpE3-42. We also confirmed that human Tau-dependent apoptotic induction was strongly enhanced by AβpE3-42.

A novel role for the 3'-5' exoribonuclease Dis3L2 in controlling cell proliferation and tissue growth,27630034,10.1080/15476286.2016.1232238,"In a complex organism, cell proliferation and apoptosis need to be precisely controlled in order for tissues to develop correctly. Excessive cell proliferation can lead to diseases such as cancer. We have shown that the exoribonuclease Dis3L2 is required for the correct regulation of proliferation in a natural tissue within the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Dis3L2 is a member of a highly conserved family of exoribonucleases that degrade RNA in a 3'-5' direction. We show that knockdown of dis3L2 in the Drosophila wing imaginal discs results in substantial wing overgrowth due to increased cellular proliferation rather than an increase in cell size. Imaginal discs are specified in the embryo before proliferating and differentiating to form the adult structures of the fly. Using RNA-seq we identified a small set of mRNAs that are sensitive to Dis3L2 activity. Of the mRNAs which increase in levels and are therefore potential targets of Dis3L2, we identified 2 that change at the post-transcriptional level but not at the transcriptional level, namely CG2678 (a transcription factor) and pyrexia (a TRP cation channel). We also demonstrate a compensatory effect between Dis3L2 and the 5'-3' exoribonuclease Pacman demonstrating that these 2 exoribonucleases function to regulate opposing pathways within the developing tissue.

Drosophila Embryos as a Model for Wound-Induced Transcriptional Dynamics: Genetic Strategies to Achieve a Localized Wound Response,27274436,10.1089/wound.2014.0544,"While many studies have established a paradigm for tissue repair at the level of cellular remodeling, it is not clear how an organism restricts a response only to the injured region of a damaged tissue. Skin, the largest organ in the human body, is prone to injury, and repair of epidermal tissue represents a medically relevant system to investigate. Significance: Studies in Drosophila melanogaster provide a robust genetic system to identify molecular components that will positively impact repair and healing. The Drosophila skin consists of a single-cell epidermal layer and relies on well-conserved cellular mechanisms to coordinate gene expression during development. Many studies have established that key developmental genes promote a response to epidermal injury, but the balance between activator and inhibitor signals to coordinate a localized response remains unknown. Recent Advances: Discovery of a genetic pathway that promotes the restriction of transcriptional response to damage only in effected regions. Interestingly, genome-wide microarray studies have identified an intersection between gene expression after aseptic injury and activation of the innate immune response. Critical Issues: The use of a transcriptional activation reporter provides an innovative approach to uncover well-conserved components that promote the localization of a response during epidermal injury and may influence other pathological conditions of tissue damage. Future Directions: The work reviewed in this critical review may lead to development of molecular strategies of repair and improved healing after injury or infection.

"Of mice, flies--and men? Comparing fungal infection models for large-scale screening efforts",25786415,10.1242/dmm.019901,"Studying infectious diseases requires suitable hosts for experimental in vivo infections. Recent years have seen the advent of many alternatives to murine infection models.

Here, we compare the commonly used models, fruit fly and mouse (representing invertebrate and mammalian hosts), for their similarities and degree of correlation upon infection with a library of mutants of an important fungal pathogen, the yeast Candida glabrata. Using two indices, for fly survival time and for mouse fungal burden in specific organs, we show a good agreement between the models. We provide a suitable predictive model for estimating the virulence potential of C. glabrata mutants in the mouse from fly survival data. As examples, we found cell wall integrity mutants attenuated in flies, and mutants of a MAP kinase pathway had defective virulence in flies and reduced relative pathogen fitness in mice. In addition, mutants with strongly reduced in vitro growth generally, but not always, had reduced virulence in flies. Overall, we demonstrate that surveying Drosophila survival after infection is a suitable model to predict the outcome of murine infections, especially for severely attenuated C. glabrata mutants.

Deep conservation of genes required for both Drosphila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans sleep includes a role for dopaminergic signaling,25142568,10.5665/sleep.3990,"Objectives:
      
    

    
      Cross-species conservation of sleep-like behaviors predicts the presence of conserved molecular mechanisms underlying sleep. However, limited experimental evidence of conservation exists. Here, this prediction is tested directly.
    

    
  


        Measurements and results:
      
    

    
      During lethargus, Caenorhabditis elegans spontaneously sleep in short bouts that are interspersed with bouts of spontaneous locomotion. We identified 26 genes required for Drosophila melanogaster sleep. Twenty orthologous C. elegans genes were selected based on similarity. Their effect on C. elegans sleep and arousal during the last larval lethargus was assessed. The 20 most similar genes altered both the quantity of sleep and arousal thresholds. In 18 cases, the direction of change was concordant with Drosophila studies published previously. Additionally, we delineated a conserved genetic pathway by which dopamine regulates sleep and arousal. In C. elegans neurons, G-alpha S, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A act downstream of D1 dopamine receptors to regulate these behaviors. Finally, a quantitative analysis of genes examined herein revealed that C. elegans arousal thresholds were directly correlated with amount of sleep during lethargus. However, bout duration varies little and was not correlated with arousal thresholds.

      The comprehensive analysis presented here suggests that conserved genes and pathways are required for sleep in invertebrates and, likely, across the entire animal kingdom. The genetic pathway delineated in this study implicates G-alpha S and previously known genes downstream of dopamine signaling in sleep. Quantitative analysis of various components of quiescence suggests that interdependent or identical cellular and molecular mechanisms are likely to regulate both arousal and sleep entry.",2014,"Komudi Singh, Jennifer Y Ju, Melissa B Walsh, Michael A DiIorio, Anne C Hart, Komudi Singh, Jennifer Y Ju, Melissa B Walsh, Michael A DiIorio, Anne C Hart"
In vivo determination of direct targets of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway in Drosophila,24429422,10.1534/g3.113.009357,"Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD) is a mRNA degradation pathway that regulates a significant portion of the transcriptome. The expression levels of numerous genes are known to be altered in NMD mutants, but it is not known which of these transcripts is a direct pathway target. Here, we present the first genome-wide analysis of direct NMD targeting in an intact animal. By using rapid reactivation of the NMD pathway in a Drosophila melanogaster NMD mutant and globally monitoring of changes in mRNA expression levels, we can distinguish between primary and secondary effects of NMD on gene expression. Using this procedure, we identified 168 candidate direct NMD targets in vivo. Remarkably, we found that 81% of direct target genes do not show increased expression levels in an NMD mutant, presumably due to feedback regulation. Because most previous studies have used up-regulation of mRNA expression as the only means to identify NMD-regulated transcripts, our results provide new directions for understanding the roles of the NMD pathway in endogenous gene regulation during animal development and physiology. For instance, we show clearly that direct target genes have longer 3' untranslated regions compared with nontargets, suggesting long 3' untranslated regions target mRNAs for NMD in vivo. In addition, we investigated the role of NMD in suppressing transcriptional noise and found that although the transposable element Copia is up-regulated in NMD mutants, this effect appears to be indirect.",2014,"Alex Chapin, Hao Hu, Shawn G Rynearson, Julie Hollien, Mark Yandell, Mark M Metzstein, Alex Chapin, Hao Hu, Shawn G Rynearson, Julie Hollien, Mark Yandell, Mark M Metzstein"
"Mummy, A UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase, modulates DPP signaling in the embryonic epidermis of Drosophila",23796903,10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.06.006,"The evolutionarily conserved JNK/AP-1 (Jun N-terminal kinase/activator protein 1) and BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signaling cascades are deployed hierarchically to regulate dorsal closure in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this developmental context, the JNK/AP-1 signaling cascade transcriptionally activates BMP signaling in leading edge epidermal cells. Here we show that the mummy (mmy) gene product, which is required for dorsal closure, functions as a BMP signaling antagonist. Genetic and biochemical tests of Mmy's role as a BMP-antagonist indicate that its function is independent of AP-1, the transcriptional trigger of BMP signal transduction in leading edge cells. pMAD (phosphorylated Mothers Against Dpp) activity data show the mmy gene product to be a new type of epidermal BMP regulator - one which transforms a BMP ligand from a long- to a short-range signal. mmy codes for the single UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase in Drosophila, and its requirement for attenuating epidermal BMP signaling during dorsal closure points to a new role for glycosylation in defining a highly restricted BMP activity field in the fly. These findings add a new dimension to our understanding of mechanisms modulating the BMP signaling gradient.",2013,"Gregory B Humphreys, Molly C Jud, Kathryn M Monroe, Suzanne S Kimball, Matthew Higley, Danielle Shipley, Marie Clougherty Vrablik, Katherine L Bates, Anthea Letsou, Gregory B Humphreys, Molly C Jud, Kathryn M Monroe, Suzanne S Kimball, Matthew Higley, Danielle Shipley, Marie Clougherty Vrablik, Katherine L Bates, Anthea Letsou"
Essential role of Duox in stabilization of Drosophila wing,21808060,10.1074/jbc.M111.263178,"NADPH oxidase produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Drosophila melanogaster has two homologs of NADPH oxidase, dNox and dDuox, with functions that remain unclear in vivo. To clarify these functions, two independent transgenic fly lines expressing dsRNA targeted for different portions of dDuox mRNA were used. In both flies, en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR(976-1145) and en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR(370-518), in which dDuox was knocked down selectively in the posterior area of the wing disc, the posterior compartment of the adult wings became paler and more fragile with wing veins that were indistinct by comparison with the anterior one. Fluorescence staining of the en-GAL4> UAS-dDuoxIR(976-1145) adult wings revealed that the ROS concentration in the posterior compartment was significantly lower than that in the anterior compartment. Moreover, in these flies, the posterior compartment of the wing imaginal disc showed a greater number of apoptotic cells detected by immunostaining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody than those in the anterior compartment. Respective knockdown of tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase showed paler wing blades in the posterior compartment similar to the phenotype of dDuox-knockdown files. Along with this observation, analysis of the catecholic and dityrosine components in the wings of adult flies proved that dDuox plays important roles in the stabilization of the cuticle structure of the wings via tyrosine cross-linking, the sclerotization and melanization processes possibly through ROS production. These dDuox-knockdown fly lines would be useful tools for further studying dDuox functions during the development of Drosophila.",2011,"Nguyen Thi Tu Anh, Maiko Nishitani, Shigeharu Harada, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Kaeko Kamei, Nguyen Thi Tu Anh, Maiko Nishitani, Shigeharu Harada, Masamitsu Yamaguchi, Kaeko Kamei"
Role of TOR signaling in aging and related biological processes in Drosophila melanogaster,21130151,10.1016/j.exger.2010.11.036,"Extensive studies in model organisms in the last few decades have revealed that aging is subject to profound genetic influence. The conserved nutrient sensing TOR (Target of Rapamycin) pathway is emerging as a key regulator of lifespan and healthspan in various species from yeast to mammals. The TOR signaling pathway plays a critical role in determining how a eukaryotic cell or a cellular system co-ordinates its growth, development and aging in response to constant changes in its surrounding environment? TOR integrates signals originating from changes in growth factors, nutrient availability, energy status and various physiological stresses. Each of these inputs is specialized to sense particular signal(s), and conveys it to the TOR complex which in turn relays the signal to downstream outputs to appropriately respond to the environmental changes. These outputs include mRNA translation, autophagy, transcription, metabolism, cell survival, proliferation and growth amongst a number of other cellular processes, some of which influence organismal lifespan. Here we review the contribution of the model organism Drosophila in the understanding of TOR signaling and the various biological processes it modulates that may impact on aging. Drosophila was the first organism where the nutrient dependent effects of the TOR pathway on lifespan were first uncovered. We also discuss how the nutrient-sensing TOR pathway appears to be critically important for mediating the longevity effects of dietary restriction (DR), a potent environmental method of lifespan extension by nutrient limitation. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that modulate lifespan downstream of TOR is being intensely investigated and there is hope that these are likely to serve as potential targets for amelioration of age-related diseases and enhance healthful lifespan extension in humans.",2011,"Subhash D Katewa, Pankaj Kapahi, Subhash D Katewa, Pankaj Kapahi"
A novel approach for in vivo screening of toxins using the Drosophila Giant Fiber circuit,20723555,10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.08.005,"Finding compounds that affect neuronal or muscular function is of great interest as potential therapeutic agents for a variety of neurological disorders. Alternative applications for these compounds include their use as molecular probes as well as insecticides. We have developed a bioassay that requires small amounts of compounds and allows for unbiased screening of biological activity in vivo. For this, we paired administering compounds in a non-invasive manner with simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from a well-characterized neuronal circuit, the Giant Fiber System of Drosophila melanogaster, which mediates the escape response of the fly. The circuit encompasses a variety of neurons with cholinergic, glutamatergic, and electrical synapses as well as neuromuscular junctions. Electrophysiological recordings from this system allow for the detection of compound-related effects against any molecular target on these components. Here, we provide evidence that this novel bioassay works with small molecules such as the cholinergic receptor blocker mecamylamine hydrochloride and the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium hydroxide, as well as with venom from Conus brunneus and isolated conopeptides. Conopeptides have been developed into powerful drugs, such as the painkillers Prialt™ and Xen2174. However, most conopeptides have yet to be characterized, revealing the need for a rapid and straightforward screening method. Our findings show that mecamylamine hydrochloride, as well as the α-conotoxin ImI, which is known to be an antagonist of the human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, efficiently disrupted the synaptic transmission of a Drosophila α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent pathway in our circuit but did not affect the function of neurons with other types of synapses. This demonstrates that our bioassay is a valid tool for screening for compounds relevant to human health.",2010,"Monica Mejia, Mari D Heghinian, Alexandra Busch, Chris J Armishaw, Frank Marí, Tanja A Godenschwege, Monica Mejia, Mari D Heghinian, Alexandra Busch, Chris J Armishaw, Frank Marí, Tanja A Godenschwege"
Classical reward conditioning in Drosophila melanogaster,16740144,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2006.00241.x,"Negatively reinforced olfactory conditioning has been widely employed to identify learning and memory genes, signal transduction pathways and neural circuitry in Drosophila. To delineate the molecular and cellular processes underlying reward-mediated learning and memory, we developed a novel assay system for positively reinforced olfactory conditioning. In this assay, flies were involuntarily exposed to the appetitive unconditioned stimulus sucrose along with a conditioned stimulus odour during training and their preference for the odour previously associated with sucrose was measured to assess learning and memory capacities. After one training session, wild-type Canton S flies displayed reliable performance, which was enhanced after two training cycles with 1-min or 15-min inter-training intervals. Higher performance scores were also obtained with increasing sucrose concentration. Memory in Canton S flies decayed slowly when measured at 30 min, 1 h and 3 h after training; whereas, it had declined significantly at 6 h and 12 h post-training. When learning mutant t beta h flies, which are deficient in octopamine, were challenged, they exhibited poor performance, validating the utility of this assay. As the Drosophila model offers vast genetic and transgenic resources, the new appetitive conditioning described here provides a useful tool with which to elucidate the molecular and cellular underpinnings of reward learning and memory. Similar to negatively reinforced conditioning, this reward conditioning represents classical olfactory conditioning. Thus, comparative analyses of learning and memory mutants in two assays may help identify the molecular and cellular components that are specific to the unconditioned stimulus information used in conditioning.",2007,"Y-C Kim, H-G Lee, K-A Han, Y-C Kim, H-G Lee, K-A Han"
Mechanisms of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase regulation,16324789,10.1016/j.bbagen.2005.10.010,"The principal objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms regulating the activity of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL; EC 6.3.2.2), the rate limiting enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis. Two phylogenetically divergent species, mouse and the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster were used to test the hypothesis that reversible protein phosphorylation and pyridine dinucleotide phosphate dependent allostery regulate GCL activity. GCL was almost completely inhibited under phosphorylating conditions, involving preincubations with MgATP and endogenous protein kinases. Maximal GCL inhibitions of 94%, 77%, 85%, 87%, 83%, 95% and 89% occurred, respectively, in mouse cerebellum, hippocampus, brainstem, striatum, cortex and heart, and Drosophila. These changes in GCL activity were detected using saturating levels of substrates, suggesting that V(max) was dramatically affected, whereas K(m) values showed no differences. In vitro activation of GCL, presumably due to dephosphorylation, was blocked by inhibitors of protein phosphatases, suggesting that GCL exists in vivo as a mixture of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms. The reversibility of the dephosphorylation-dependent activation was indicated by the time-dependent inactivation of the in vitro activated Drosophila GCL, by preincubation with MgATP. NADPH increased maximal GCL activity by up to 93%, whereas several other nucleotide analogues did not, thereby demonstrating specificity. Kinetic analysis using Hanes-Woolf replots of initial velocity data suggested that the NADPH-dependent stimulation of GCL activity is brought about by a change in the maximal activity, V(max), rather than changes in substrate affinity. Results of this study suggest that mechanisms of modulation of eukaryotic GCL enzymes may include specific binding of ligands such as pyridine dinucleotide phosphates and reversible protein phosphorylation.",2006,"Dikran Toroser, Connie S Yarian, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal, Dikran Toroser, Connie S Yarian, William C Orr, Rajindar S Sohal"
Role of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling in the wound healing and regeneration of a Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc,15968584,10.1387/ijdb.052006jm,"When a fragment of a Drosophila imaginal disc is cultured in growth permissive conditions, it either regenerates the missing structures or duplicates the pattern present in the fragment. This kind of pattern regulation is known to be epimorphic, i.e. the new pattern is generated by proliferation in a specialized tissue called the blastema. Pattern regulation is accompanied by the healing of the cut surfaces restoring the continuous epithelia. Wound healing has been considered to be the inductive signal to commence regenerative cell divisions. Although the general outlines of the proliferation dynamics in a regenerating imaginal disc blastema have been well studied, little is known about the mechanisms driving cells into the regenerative cell cycles. In this study, we have investigated the role of Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling in the wound healing and regeneration of a Drosophila wing imaginal disc. By utilizing in vivo and in vitro culturing of incised and fragmented discs, we have been able to visualize the dynamics in cellular architecture and gene expression involved in the healing and regeneration process. Our results directly show that homotypic wound healing is not a prerequisite for regenerative cell divisions. We also show that JNK signaling participates in imaginal disc wound healing and is regulated by the physical dynamics of the process, as well as in recruiting cells into the regenerative cell cycles. A model describing the determination of blastema size is discussed.",2005,"Jaakko Mattila, Leonid Omelyanchuk, Satu Kyttälä, Heikki Turunen, Seppo Nokkala, Jaakko Mattila, Leonid Omelyanchuk, Satu Kyttälä, Heikki Turunen, Seppo Nokkala"
Annotated expressed sequence tags and cDNA microarrays for studies of brain and behavior in the honey bee,11932240,10.1101/gr.5302,"To accelerate the molecular analysis of behavior in the honey bee (Apis mellifera), we created expressed sequence tag (EST) and cDNA microarray resources for the bee brain. Over 20,000 cDNA clones were partially sequenced from a normalized (and subsequently subtracted) library generated from adult A. mellifera brains. These sequences were processed to identify 15,311 high-quality ESTs representing 8912 putative transcripts. Putative transcripts were functionally annotated (using the Gene Ontology classification system) based on matching gene sequences in Drosophila melanogaster. The brain ESTs represent a broad range of molecular functions and biological processes, with neurobiological classifications particularly well represented. Roughly half of Drosophila genes currently implicated in synaptic transmission and/or behavior are represented in the Apis EST set. Of Apis sequences with open reading frames of at least 450 bp, 24% are highly diverged with no matches to known protein sequences. Additionally, over 100 Apis transcript sequences conserved with other organisms appear to have been lost from the Drosophila genome. DNA microarrays were fabricated with over 7000 EST cDNA clones putatively representing different transcripts.

Metamorphosis in drosophila and other insects: the fate of neurons throughout the stages,10821983,10.1016/s0301-0082(99)00069-6,"The nervous system of insects is profoundly reorganised during metamorphosis, affecting the fate of different types of neuron in different ways. Almost all adult motor neurons derive from larval motor neurons that are respecified for adult functions. A subset of larval motor neurons, those which mediate larval- or ecdysis-specific behaviours, die before and immediately after eclosion, respectively. Many adult interneurons develop from larval interneurons, whereas those related to complex adult sense organs originate during larval life from persisting embryonic neuroblasts. Sensory neurons of larvae and adults derive from essentially two distinct sources. Larval sensory neurons are formed in the embryonic integument and - with few exceptions - die during metamorphosis. Their adult counterparts, on the other hand, arise from imaginal discs. Special emphasis is given in this review to the metamorphic remodelling of persisting neurons, both at the input and output levels, and to the associated behavioural changes. Other sections deal with the programmed death of motor neurons and its causes, as well as with the metamorphic interactions between motor neurons and their target muscles. Remodelling and apoptosis of these two elements appear to be under independent ecdysteroid control. This review focusses on the two most thoroughly studied holometabolous species, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta. While Manduca has a long tradition in neurodevelopmental studies due to the identification of many of its neurons, Drosophila has been increasingly used to investigate neural reorganisation thanks to neurogenetic tools and molecular approaches.

Nitric oxide and cyclic GMP induce vesicle release at Drosophila neuromuscular junction,10363907,10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19990605)39:3<337::aid-neu1>3.0.co;2-9,"Nitric oxide (NO) diffuses as short-lived messenger through the plasma membrane and serves, among many other functions, as an activator of the cGMP synthesizing enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). In view of recent genetic investigations that postulated a retrograde signal from the larval muscle fibers to the presynaptic terminals, we looked for the presence of an NO/cGMP signaling system at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. Application of NO donors induced cGMP immunoreactivity in the presynaptic terminals but not the postsynaptic muscle fibers at an identified NMJ. The NO-induced cGMP immunoreactivity was sensitive to a specific inhibitor (ODQ) of the sGC. Since presynaptic terminals which were surgically isolated from the central nervous system are capable of synthesizing cGMP, we suggest that an NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase is present in the terminal arborizations. Using a fluorescent dye that is known to stain recycling synaptic vesicles, we demonstrate that NO donors and membrane permeant cGMP analogues cause vesicle release at the NMJ. Moreover, the NO-induced release could be blocked by the specific inhibitor of the sGC. A destaining of synaptic terminals after NO exposure in Ca2+-free solution in the presence of cobalt chloride as a channel blocker suggested that NO stimulates Ca2+-independent vesicle release at the NMJ. The combined immunocytochemical and exocytosis imaging experiments imply the involvement of cGMP and NO in the regulation of vesicle release at the NMJ of Drosophila larvae.",1999,"B Wildemann, G Bicker, B Wildemann, G Bicker"
CYTOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PREMEIOTIC VERSUS POSTMEIOTIC DEFECTS PRODUCING HYBRID MALE STERILITY AMONG SIBLING SPECIES OF THE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER COMPLEX,28565214,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1998.tb01834.x,"In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybridizations between species of the Drosophila simulans clade produce fertile females but sterile males. In this study, a comprehensive characterization was undertaken on the six types of F1 males that were the result of the crosses between D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana. With the use of light and electron microscopy, it was shown that while each particular hybrid genotype exhibited a specific sterility phenotype, these phenotypes fell into two distinct classes. The two hybrid genotypes that possessed D. mauritiana X-chromosomes contained spermatogenic defects that caused arrests in premeiotic spermatogenic stages. The other four F1 hybrids possessed postmeiotic spermatogenic defects. Nonsynchronous cell divisions, underdeveloped mitochondrial derivative-axonemal associations, and microtubule abnormalities were common to all of these hybrids. Each particular postmeiotically defective hybrid genotype demonstrated characteristically distinct profiles in sperm bundle number in addition to characteristic spermiogenic arrests in the furthest developed spermatids. These results in species hybrids contrast with the absence of significant differences in spermatogenic characters between species of this clade. In addition, by utilizing an attached-X cross, we investigated the influence of maternal effects and cytoplasmic factors on the sterility of D. simulans F1 hybrids and found none. However, we discovered a strain of D. simulans (2119) that caused a large shift in sterility from postmeiotic to premeiotic when crossed to D. sechellia. This suggests that D. simulans is polymorphic for genes involving premeiotic and postmeiotic sterility and that the two types of sterilities between species may have a simple genetic basis.",1998,"Rob Kulathinal, Rama S Singh, Rob Kulathinal, Rama S Singh"
Genotoxicity of N-nitroso-N-methylurea and acetone oxime in the transgenic Drosophila carrying the human gene encoding a subunit of glutathione S-transferase,9158945,,"The genotoxic effects of N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) and acetone oxime (ACOX) were tested in the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster.

The SMART assay is used here to demonstrate genotoxicity and to determine the effect of human glutathione S-transferase on the genotoxic response. Three types of Drosophila strains were used: non-transgenic strains first described by Szabad (1986), transgenic strains derived from the Szabad strains but expressing the bacterial lacZ gene, and similarly derived transgenic strains expressing the HGST gene. MNU was highly genotoxic in both transgenic and non-transgenic flies. The non-transgenic lies were significantly more sensitive to the genotoxic effects of MNU compared to both types of transgenic flies. There were statistically significant differences between the transgenic HGST crosses and transgenic lacZ and non-transgenic control crosses but there was no significant difference between the genotoxic response to MNU in flies from the transgenic cross with lacZ and from the cross carrying three copies of HGST.

Evolution of the insect body plan as revealed by the Sex combs reduced expression pattern,9006076,,"The products of the HOM/Hox homeotic genes form a set of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that control elaborate developmental processes and specify cell fates in many metazoans. We examined the expression of the ortholog of the homeotic gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) of Drosophila melanogaster in insects of three divergent orders: Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Thysanura. Our data reflect how the conservation and variation of Scr expression has affected the morphological evolution of insects. Whereas the anterior epidermal expression of Scr, in a small part of the posterior maxillary and all of the labial segment, is found to be in common among all four insect orders, the posterior (thoracic) expression domains vary. Unlike what is observed in flies, the Scr orthologs of other insects are not expressed broadly over the first thoracic segment, but are restricted to small patches. We show here that Scr is required for suppression of wings on the prothorax of Drosophila. Moreover, Scr expression at the dorsal base of the prothoracic limb in two other winged insects, crickets (Orthoptera) and milkweed bugs (Hemiptera), is consistent with Scr acting as a suppressor of prothoracic wings in these insects. Scr is also expressed in a small patch of cells near the basitarsal-tibial junction of milkweed bugs, precisely where a leg comb develops, suggesting that Scr promotes comb formation, as it does in Drosophila. Surprisingly, the dorsal prothoracic expression of Scr is also present in the primitively wingless firebrat (Thysanura) and the leg patch is seen in crickets, which have no comb. Mapping both gene expression patterns and morphological characters onto the insect phylogenetic tree demonstrates that in the cases of wing suppression and comb formation the appearance of expression of Scr in the prothorax apparently precedes these specific functions.",1997,"B T Rogers, M D Peterson, T C Kaufman, B T Rogers, M D Peterson, T C Kaufman"
Effect of constant light and circadian entrainment of perS flies: evidence for light-mediated delay of the negative feedback loop in Drosophila,9003764,,"Light is the dominant environmental cue that provides temporal information to circadian pacemakers. In Drosophila melanogaster some period gene mutants have altered free-running circadian periods but entrain to 24 h light-dark cycles. To address the mechanism of light entrainment in Drosophila, we examined the effects of constant light on the period gene (per) and timeless gene (tim) products in wild-type and perS flies. The results indicate that light affects three features of the PER-TIM program: PER and TIM phosphorylation, PER and TIM accumulation, and per and tim RNA cycling. A post-transcriptional effect on the PER-TIM complex is the likely primary clock target, which then delays the subsequent decrease in per and tim RNA levels. This is consistent with a negative feedback loop, in which the PER-TIM complex contributes to the decrease in per and tim RNA levels, presumably at the transcriptional level. There are enhanced constant light effects on the perS mutant, which further support negative feedback as well as support its importance to entrainment of these flies to a 24 h cycle, far from their intrinsic period of 19 h. The perS mutant leads to a truncated protein accumulation phase and a subsequent premature perS RNA increase. A standard 24 h light-dark cycle delays the negative feedback circuit and extends the RNA and protein profiles, compensating for the accelerated RNA increase and restoring the rhythms to wild-type-like periodicity.",1996,"S B Marrus, H Zeng, M Rosbash, S B Marrus, H Zeng, M Rosbash"
A serine-kinase associated with the p127-l(2)gl tumour suppressor of Drosophila may regulate the binding of p127 to nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain and the attachment of p127 to the plasma membrane,8799824,,"The p127 tumour suppressor protein encoded by the lethal(2)giant larvae, [l(2)gl], gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a component of a cytoskeletal network distributed in both the cytoplasm and on the inner face of the plasma membrane. The p127 protein forms high molecular mass complexes consisting mainly of homo-oligomerized p127 molecules and at least ten additional proteins. One of these proteins has been recently identified as nonmuscle myosin type II heavy chain. To determine the functional interactions between p127 and other proteins present in the p127 complexes, we analyzed p127 for posttranslational modifications and found that p127 can be phosphorylated at serine residues. In this report we describe the characteristics of a serine kinase which is associated with p127, as judged by its recovery in p127 complexes purified by either gel filtration or immuno-affinity chromatography. This kinase phosphorylates p127 in vitro and its activation by supplementing ATP results in the release of p127 from the plasma membrane. Moreover, similar activation of the kinase present in immuno-purified p127 complexes dissociates nonmuscle myosin II from p127 without affecting the homo-oligomerization of p127. This dissociation can be inhibited by staurosporine and a 26mer peptide covering amino acid positions 651 to 676 of p127 and containing five serine residues which are evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to humans. These results indicate that a serine-kinase tightly associated with p127 regulates p127 binding with components of the cytoskeleton present in both the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane.",1996,"A Kalmes, G Merdes, B Neumann, D Strand, B M Mechler, A Kalmes, G Merdes, B Neumann, D Strand, B M Mechler"
Direct repeats bind the EcR/USP receptor and mediate ecdysteroid responses in Drosophila melanogaster,8649409,10.1128/mcb.16.6.2977,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone plays a key role in the induction and modulation of morphogenetic events throughout Drosophila development. Previous studies have shown that a heterodimeric nuclear receptor composed of the EcR and USP proteins mediates the action of the hormone at the transcriptional through binding to palindromic ecdysteroid mediates the action of the hormone at the transcriptional level through binding to palindromic ecdysteroid response elements (EcREs) such as those present in the promoter of the hsp27 gene or the fat body-specific enhancer of the Fbp1 gene. We show that in addition to palindromic EcREs, the EcR/USP heterodimer can bind in vitro with various affinities to direct repetitions of the motif AGGTCA separated by 1 to 5 nucleotides (DR1 to DR5), which are known to be target sites for vertebrate nuclear receptors. At variance with the receptors, EcR/USP was also found to bind to a DR0 direct repeat with no intervening nucleotide. In cell transformation assays, direct repeats DR0 to DR5 alone can render the minimum viral tk or Drosophila Fbp1 promoter responsive to 20-hydroxyecdysone, as does the palindromic hsp27 EcRE. In a transgenic assay, however, neither the palindromic hsp27 element nor direct repeat DR3 alone can make the Fbp1 minimal promoter responsive to premetamorphic ecdysteroid peaks. In contrast, DR0 and DR3 elements, when substituted for the natural palindromic EcRE in the context of the Fbp1 enhancer, can drive a strong fat body-specific ecdysteroid response in transgenic animals. These results demonstrate that directly repeated EcR/USP binding sites are as effective as palindromic EcREs in vivo. They also provide evidence that additional flanking regulatory sequences are crucially required to potentiate the hormonal response mediated by both types of elements and specify its spatial and temporal pattern.",1996,"C Antoniewski, B Mugat, F Delbac, J A Lepesant, C Antoniewski, B Mugat, F Delbac, J A Lepesant"
"A new method for manipulating transgenes: engineering heat tolerance in a complex, multicellular organism",15335817,10.1016/0960-9822(93)90218-d,"Background:
      
    

    
      Heat-shock proteins (hsps) are thought to protect cells against stresses, especially due to elevated temperatures. But while genetic manipulation of hsp gene expression can protect microorganisms and cultured metazoan cells against lethal stress, this has so far not been demonstrated in multicellular organisms. Testing whether expression of an hsp transgene contributes to increased stress tolerance is complicated by a general problem of transgene analysis: if the transgene cannot be targeted to a precise site in the genome, newly observed phenotypes may be due to either the action of the transgene or mutations caused by the transgene insertion.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To study the relationship between heat tolerance and hsp expression in Drosophila melanogaster, we have developed a novel method for transgene analysis, based upon the site-specific FLP recombinase. The method employs site-specific sister chromatid exchange to create an allelic series of transgene insertions that share the same integration site, but differ in transgene copy number. Phenotypic differences between members of this series can be confidently attributed to the transgenes. Using such an allelic series and a novel thermotolerance assay for Drosophila embryos, we investigated the role of the 70 kD heat-shock protein, Hsp 70, in thermotolerance. At early embryonic stages, Hsp70 accumulation was rate-limiting for thermotolerance, and elevated Hsp70 expression increased survival at extreme temperatures.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results provide an improved method for analyzing transgenes and demonstrate that, in Drosophila, Hsp70 is a critical thermotolerance factor. They show, moreover, that manipulating the expression of a single hsp can be sufficient to improve the stress tolerance of a complex multicellular organism.",1993,"M A Welte, J M Tetrault, R P Dellavalle, S L Lindquist, M A Welte, J M Tetrault, R P Dellavalle, S L Lindquist"
Nucleotide sequences responsible for the thermal inducibility of the Drosophila small heat-shock protein genes in monkey COS cells,2409289,10.1016/0022-2836(85)90233-5,"The promoter regions of the Drosophila melanogaster small heat-shock protein genes have been analysed in order to localize those sequences responsible for their heat-shock transcriptional inducibility. Different lengths of the 5' DNA sequences of these four genes were each fused individually to the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) transcription unit. These hybrid genes were constructed in a simian virus 40 recombinant vector for transfection in permissive monkey COS cells and tested for their heat-shock inducibility. The hsp22/HSV-tk and hsp26/HSV-tk fusion genes were found to be heat-inducible at 43 degrees C, giving rise to correctly initiated transcripts, but transcriptionally quiescent at 37 degrees C (control temperature). The hsp23 and hsp27 fusion gene constructs are, however, not heat-shock-inducible; no transcripts being detectable from hsp27/HSV-tk constructs at either temperature and all hsp23/HSV-tk clones being faithfully but constitutively expressed at low levels at both temperatures. By testing a series of 5' deletion mutants in hsp22/HSV-tk, a homologous sequence located adjacent to the TATA box in both the hsp22 and hsp26 genes was identified as being responsible for their heat-shock activation. This control element corresponds to the Pelham ""consensus sequence"", previously described for the Drosophila hsp70 genes. The possible modes of transcriptional induction of all four genes are discussed.",1985,"A Ayme, R Southgate, A Tissières, A Ayme, R Southgate, A Tissières"
Selective arrangement of ubiquitinated and D1 protein-containing nucleosomes within the Drosophila genome,6277512,10.1016/0092-8674(82)90355-5,"We have a new approach, two-dimensional hybridization mapping of nucleosomes, to compare the structures of mononucleosomes from different regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Approximately one in two nucleosomes of the transcribed copia and heat-shock 70 (hsp 70) genes in nonshocked cultured cells contains ubiquitin-H2A (uH2A) semihistone, a covalent conjugate of histone H2A and a small protein, ubiquitin. In striking contrast, less than one in 25 nucleosomes of tandemly repeated, nontranscribed 1.688 satellite DNA contains uH2A, suggesting that most of the nucleosomal uH2A is located in transcribed genes. Approximately 25% of all nucleosomes are ubiquitinated in nonsynchronized cultured Drosophila cells. The hsp 70 genes in nonshocked cells occur in nucleosomes, are greatly enriched in uH2A and are not digested preferentially by staphylococcal nuclease. In contrast, the same genes in chromatin from heat-shocked cells are highly sensitive to staphylococcal nuclease and no longer possess nucleosomal organization recognizable with this probe. Histone ubiquitination in transcribed nucleosomes may prevent formation of higher order chromosomal structures by modifying nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. The observed loss of nucleosomal organization in very actively transcribed genes, such as the hsp 70 genes in shocked cells, may be related to the recent finding that ubiquitin conjugates are substrates for the cytoplasmic ATP-dependent proteolytic system. We have also found that 1.688 satellite mononucleotomes contain a specific approximately 50,000 dalton nonhistone protein, D1, in addition to being extremely under-ubiquitinated. D1 may be involved in formation of the highly compact structure of satellite heterochromatin.",1982,"L Levinger, A Varshavsky, L Levinger, A Varshavsky"
Insulin Signaling in Intestinal Stem and Progenitor Cells as an Important Determinant of Physiological and Metabolic Traits in Drosophila,32225024,10.3390/cells9040803,"The insulin-IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway is conserved throughout multicellular organisms and regulates many traits, including aging, reproduction, feeding, metabolism, stress resistance, and growth. Here, we present evidence of a survival-sustaining role for IIS in a subset of gut cells in Drosophila melanogaster, namely the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and progenitor cells. Using RNAi to knockdown the insulin receptor, we found that inhibition of IIS in ISCs statistically shortened the lifespan of experimental flies compared with non-knockdown controls, and also shortened their survival under starvation or malnutrition conditions. These flies also showed decreased reproduction and feeding, and had lower amounts of glycogen and glucose in the body. In addition, increased expression was observed for the Drosophila transcripts for the insulin-like peptides dilp2, dilp5, and dilp6. This may reflect increased insulin signaling in peripheral tissues supported by up-regulation of the target of the brain insulin gene (tobi). In contrast, activation of IIS (via knockdown of the insulin pathway inhibitor PTEN) in intestinal stem and progenitor cells decreased fly resistance to malnutrition, potentially by affecting adipokinetic hormone signaling. Finally, Pten knockdown to enhance IIS also activated JAK-STAT signaling in gut tissue by up-regulation of upd2, upd3, and soc36 genes, as well as genes encoding the EGF receptor ligands spitz and vein. These results clearly demonstrate that manipulating insulin levels may be used to modulate various fly traits, which are important determinants of organismal survival.",2020,"Olha M Strilbytska, Uliana V Semaniuk, Kenneth B Storey, Ihor S Yurkevych, Oleh Lushchak, Olha M Strilbytska, Uliana V Semaniuk, Kenneth B Storey, Ihor S Yurkevych, Oleh Lushchak"
Isolation of stage-specific germ cells using FACS in Drosophila germarium,32423645,10.1016/bs.mcb.2020.02.003,"Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis is a versatile model system to address many fundamental questions of cell and developmental biology, such as stem cell biology, mitosis, meiosis or cell polarity. Many mutagenesis and powerful genetic tools have contributed massively to identify and dissect in vivo gene functions in a stage and tissue specific manner. However, the small number of germ cells during the early steps of oogenesis have hampered a systematic description of RNA and protein contents at each stage. We describe here a protocol for isolating and comparing two small subpopulations of cells in the ovary for the purpose of RNA sequence profiling. The method is based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of GFP- and RFP-labeled proteins that are expressed in distinct and mostly non-overlapping regions of the germline. We used a transgene expressing a GFP-tagged Bam protein driven by its own promoter, labeling specifically the mitotic region of the germarium. We also took advantage of the short-lived Wicked protein tagged with RFP and expressed under the nanos promoter to label the meiotic region. We generated flies expressing both markers and were able to sort enough cells from each region to extract total RNAs and small RNAs. Total RNA or small RNA extracted from sorted cells were then used to generate deep-sequencing libraries that show specificity toward each compartment. This method of isolating a very small number of cells and the data generated from comparing distinct cell populations within the germline should further our understanding of these conserved steps of oogenesis.",2020,"Ana Maria Vallés, Jean-René Huynh, Ana Maria Vallés, Jean-René Huynh"
Lamina feedback neurons regulate the bandpass property of the flicker-induced orientation response in Drosophila,32383496,10.1111/jnc.15036,"Natural scenes contain complex visual cues with specific features, including color, motion, flicker, and position. It is critical to understand how different visual features are processed at the early stages of visual perception to elicit appropriate cellular responses, and even behavioral output. Here, we studied the visual orientation response induced by flickering stripes in a novel behavioral paradigm in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that free walking flies exhibited bandpass orientation response to flickering stripes of different frequencies. The most sensitive frequency spectrum was confined to low frequencies of 2-4 Hz. Through genetic silencing, we showed that lamina L1 and L2 neurons, which receive visual inputs from R1 to R6 neurons, were the main components in mediating flicker-induced orientation behavior. Moreover, specific blocking of different types of lamina feedback neurons Lawf1, Lawf2, C2, C3, and T1 modulated orientation responses to flickering stripes of particular frequencies, suggesting that bandpass orientation response was generated through cooperative modulation of lamina feedback neurons. Furthermore, we found that lamina feedback neurons Lawf1 were glutamatergic. Thermal activation of Lawf1 neurons could suppress neural activities in L1 and L2 neurons, which could be blocked by the glutamate-gated chloride channel inhibitor picrotoxin (PTX). In summary, lamina monopolar neurons L1 and L2 are the primary components in mediating flicker-induced orientation response. Meanwhile, lamina feedback neurons cooperatively modulate the orientation response in a frequency-dependent way, which might be achieved through modulating neural activities of L1 and L2 neurons.",2020,"Deliang Yuan, Xiaoxiao Ji, Shun Hao, Julia Yvonne Gestrich, Wenlan Duan, Xinwei Wang, Yuanhang Xiang, Jihua Yang, Pengbo Hu, Mengbo Xu, Li Liu, Hongying Wei, Deliang Yuan, Xiaoxiao Ji, Shun Hao, Julia Yvonne Gestrich, Wenlan Duan, Xinwei Wang, Yuanhang Xiang, Jihua Yang, Pengbo Hu, Mengbo Xu, Li Liu, Hongying Wei"
Invertebrate Retinal Progenitors as Regenerative Models in a Microfluidic System,31652654,10.3390/cells8101301,"Regenerative retinal therapies have introduced progenitor cells to replace dysfunctional or injured neurons and regain visual function. While contemporary cell replacement therapies have delivered retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) within customized biomaterials to promote viability and enable transplantation, outcomes have been severely limited by the misdirected and/or insufficient migration of transplanted cells. RPCs must achieve appropriate spatial and functional positioning in host retina, collectively, to restore vision, whereas movement of clustered cells differs substantially from the single cell migration studied in classical chemotaxis models. Defining how RPCs interact with each other, neighboring cell types and surrounding extracellular matrixes are critical to our understanding of retinogenesis and the development of effective, cell-based approaches to retinal replacement. The current article describes a new bio-engineering approach to investigate the migratory responses of innate collections of RPCs upon extracellular substrates by combining microfluidics with the well-established invertebrate model of Drosophila melanogaster. Experiments utilized microfluidics to investigate how the composition, size, and adhesion of RPC clusters on defined extracellular substrates affected migration to exogenous chemotactic signaling. Results demonstrated that retinal cluster size and composition influenced RPC clustering upon extracellular substrates of concanavalin (Con-A), Laminin (LM), and poly-L-lysine (PLL), and that RPC cluster size greatly altered collective migratory responses to signaling from Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), a primary chemotactic agent in Drosophila. These results highlight the significance of examining collective cell-biomaterial interactions on bio-substrates of emerging biomaterials to aid directional migration of transplanted cells. Our approach further introduces the benefits of pairing genetically controlled models with experimentally controlled microenvironments to advance cell replacement therapies.",2019,"Caroline D Pena, Stephanie Zhang, Robert Majeska, Tadmiri Venkatesh, Maribel Vazquez, Caroline D Pena, Stephanie Zhang, Robert Majeska, Tadmiri Venkatesh, Maribel Vazquez"
Binding of SU(VAR)3-9 Partially Depends on SETDB1 in the Chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,31491894,10.3390/cells8091030,"H3K9 methylation is known to play a critical role in gene silencing. This modification is established and maintained by several enzymes, but relationships between them are not fully understood. In the present study, we decipher the interplay between two Drosophila H3K9-specific histone methyltransferases, SU(VAR)3-9 and SETDB1. We asked whether SETDB1 is required for targeting of SU(VAR)3-9. Using DamID-seq, we obtained SU(VAR)3-9 binding profiles for the chromosomes from larval salivary glands and germline cells from adult females, and compared profiles between the wild type and SETDB1-mutant backgrounds. Our analyses indicate that the vast majority of single copy genes in euchromatin are targeted by SU(VAR)3-9 only in the presence of SETDB1, whereas SU(VAR)3-9 binding at repeated sequences in heterochromatin is largely SETDB1-independent. Interestingly, piRNA clusters 42AB and 38C in salivary gland chromosomes bind SU(VAR)3-9 regardless of SETDB1, whereas binding to the same regions in the germline cells is SETDB1-dependent. In addition, we compared SU(VAR)3-9 profiles in female germline cells at different developmental stages (germarium cells in juvenile ovaries and mature nurse cells). It turned out that SU(VAR)3-9 binding is influenced both by the presence of SETDB1, as well as by the differentiation stage.",2019,"Daniil A Maksimov, Dmitry E Koryakov, Daniil A Maksimov, Dmitry E Koryakov"
Evolution of the activation domain in a Hox transcription factor,30604844,10.1387/ijdb.180151sb,"Linking changes in amino acid sequences to the evolution of transcription regulatory domains is often complicated by the low sequence complexity and high mutation rates of intrinsically disordered protein regions. For the Hox transcription factor Ultrabithorax (Ubx), conserved motifs distributed throughout the protein sequence enable direct comparison of specific protein regions, despite variations in the length and composition of the intervening sequences. In cell culture, the strength of transcription activation by Drosophila melanogaster Ubx correlates with the presence of a predicted helix within its activation domain. Curiously, this helix is not preserved in species more divergent than flies, suggesting the nature of transcription activation may have evolved. To determine whether this helix contributes to Drosophila Ubx function in vivo, wild-type and mutant proteins were ectopically expressed in the developing wing and the phenotypes evaluated. Helix mutations alter Drosophila Ubx activity in the developing wing, demonstrating its functional importance in vivo. The locations of activation domains in Ubx orthologues were identified by testing the ability of truncation mutants to activate transcription in yeast one-hybrid assays. In Ubx orthologues representing 540 million years of evolution, the ability to activate transcription varies substantially. The sequence and the location of the activation domains also differ. Consequently, analogous regions of Ubx orthologues change function over time, and may activate transcription in one species, but have no activity, or even inhibit transcription activation in another species. Unlike homeodomain-DNA binding, the nature of transcription activation by Ubx has substantially evolved.",2018,"Ying Liu, Annie Huang, Rebecca M Booth, Gabriela Geraldo Mendes, Zabeena Merchant, Kathleen S Matthews, Sarah E Bondos, Ying Liu, Annie Huang, Rebecca M Booth, Gabriela Geraldo Mendes, Zabeena Merchant, Kathleen S Matthews, Sarah E Bondos"
Drosophila CaV2 channels harboring human migraine mutations cause synapse hyperexcitability that can be suppressed by inhibition of a Ca2+ store release pathway,30080864,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007577,"Gain-of-function mutations in the human CaV2.1 gene CACNA1A cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). To characterize cellular problems potentially triggered by CaV2.1 gains of function, we engineered mutations encoding FHM1 amino-acid substitutions S218L (SL) and R192Q (RQ) into transgenes of Drosophila melanogaster CaV2/cacophony. We expressed the transgenes pan-neuronally. Phenotypes were mild for RQ-expressing animals. By contrast, single mutant SL- and complex allele RQ,SL-expressing animals showed overt phenotypes, including sharply decreased viability. By electrophysiology, SL- and RQ,SL-expressing neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) exhibited enhanced evoked discharges, supernumerary discharges, and an increase in the amplitudes and frequencies of spontaneous events. Some spontaneous events were gigantic (10-40 mV), multi-quantal events. Gigantic spontaneous events were eliminated by application of TTX-or by lowered or chelated Ca2+-suggesting that gigantic events were elicited by spontaneous nerve firing. A follow-up genetic approach revealed that some neuronal hyperexcitability phenotypes were reversed after knockdown or mutation of Drosophila homologs of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), IP3 receptor, or ryanodine receptor (RyR)-all factors known to mediate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological inhibitors of intracellular Ca2+ store release produced similar effects. Interestingly, however, the decreased viability phenotype was not reversed by genetic impairment of intracellular Ca2+ release factors. On a cellular level, our data suggest inhibition of signaling that triggers intracellular Ca2+ release could counteract hyperexcitability induced by gains of CaV2.1 function.",2018,"Douglas J Brusich, Ashlyn M Spring, Thomas D James, Catherine J Yeates, Timothy H Helms, C Andrew Frank, Douglas J Brusich, Ashlyn M Spring, Thomas D James, Catherine J Yeates, Timothy H Helms, C Andrew Frank"
RhoGAPp190: A potential player in tbph-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila,29652933,10.1371/journal.pone.0195845,"TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, Drosophila melanogaster is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein in vivo. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3'-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of Drosophila RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from in vivo tbph loss-of-function.",2018,"Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano, Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano"
The Complexities and Nuances of Analyzing the Genome of Drosophila ananassae and Its Wolbachia Endosymbiont,29301977,10.1534/g3.117.300164,"In ""Retrotransposons Are the Major Contributors to the Expansion of the Drosophila ananassae Muller F Element,"" Leung et al. (2017) improved contigs attributed to the Muller F element from the original CAF1 assembly, and used them to conclude that most of the sequence expansion of the fourth chromosome of D. ananassae is due to a higher transposon load than previously thought, but is not due to Wolbachia DNA integrations. While we do not disagree with the first conclusion, the authors base their second conclusion on the lack of homology detected between their improved CAF1 genome assembly attributed to D. ananassae and reference Wolbachia genomes. While the consensus CAF1 genome assembly lacks any sequence similarity to the reference genome of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (wMel), numerous studies from multiple laboratories provide experimental support for a large lateral/horizontal gene transfer (LGT) of a Wolbachia genome into this D. ananassae line. As such, we strongly suspect that the original whole genome assembly was either constructed after the removal of all Wolbachia reads, or that Wolbachia sequences were directly removed from the contigs in the CAF1 assembly. Hence, Leung et al. (2017) could not have identified the Wolbachia LGT using the CAF1 assembly. This manuscript by Leung et al. (2017) highlights that an assembly of the Wolbachia sequence reads and their mate pairs was erroneously attributed solely to the Wolbachia endosymbiont, albeit before we understood the extent of LGT in D. ananassae As such, we recommend that the sequences deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under PRJNA13365 should not be attributed to Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. ananassae, but should have their taxonomy reclassified by NCBI as ""Unclassified sequences.""

The Effects of Sex-Biased Gene Expression and X-Linkage on Rates of Sequence Evolution in Drosophila,29228267,10.1093/molbev/msx317,"A faster rate of adaptive evolution of X-linked genes compared with autosomal genes (the faster-X effect) can be caused by the fixation of recessive or partially recessive advantageous mutations. This effect should be largest for advantageous mutations that affect only male fitness, and least for mutations that affect only female fitness. We tested these predictions in Drosophila melanogaster by using coding and functionally significant noncoding sequences of genes with different levels of sex-biased expression. Consistent with theory, nonsynonymous substitutions in most male-biased and unbiased genes show faster adaptive evolution on the X. However, genes with very low recombination rates do not show such an effect, possibly as a consequence of Hill-Robertson interference. Contrary to expectation, there was a substantial faster-X effect for female-biased genes. After correcting for recombination rate differences, however, female-biased genes did not show a faster X-effect. Similar analyses of noncoding UTRs and long introns showed a faster-X effect for all groups of genes, other than introns of female-biased genes. Given the strong evidence that deleterious mutations are mostly recessive or partially recessive, we would expect a slower rate of evolution of X-linked genes for slightly deleterious mutations that become fixed by genetic drift. Surprisingly, we found little evidence for this after correcting for recombination rate, implying that weakly deleterious mutations are mostly close to being semidominant. This is consistent with evidence from polymorphism data, which we use to test how models of selection that assume semidominance with no sex-specific fitness effects may bias estimates of purifying selection.",2018,"José Luis Campos, Keira J A Johnston, Brian Charlesworth, José Luis Campos, Keira J A Johnston, Brian Charlesworth"
"Cloning and analysis of peptidoglycan recognition protein-LC and immune deficiency from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella",29193237,10.1002/arch.21436,"Peptidoglycan (PGN) exists in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as a component of the cell wall. PGN is an important target to be recognized by the innate immune system of animals. PGN recognition proteins (PGRP) are responsible for recognizing PGNs. In Drosophila melanogaster, PGRP-LC and IMD (immune deficiency) are critical for activating the Imd pathway. Here, we report the cloning and analysis of PGRP-LC and IMD (PxPGRP-LC and PxIMD) from diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), the insect pest of cruciferous vegetables. PxPGRP-LC gene consists of six exons encoding a polypeptide of 308 amino acid residues with a transmembrane region and a PGRP domain. PxIMD cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 251 amino acid residues with a death domain. Sequence comparisons indicate that they are characteristic of Drosophila PGRP-LC and IMD homologs. PxPGRP-LC and PxIMD were expressed in various tissues and developmental stages. Their mRNA levels were affected by bacterial challenges. The PGRP domain of PxPGRP-LC lacks key residues for the amidase activity, but it can recognize two types of PGNs. Overexpression of full-length and deletion mutants in Drosophila S2 cells induced expression of some antimicrobial peptide genes.

Cleavage of the Drosophila seminal protein Acp36DE in mated females enhances its sperm storage activity,28676322,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.06.015,"Sperm storage in the mated female reproductive tract (RT) is required for optimal fertility in numerous species with internal fertilization. In Drosophila melanogaster, sperm storage is dependent on female receipt of seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) during mating. The seminal fluid protein Acp36DE is necessary for the accumulation of sperm into storage. In the female RT, Acp36DE localizes to the anterior mating plug and also to a site in the common oviduct, potentially ""corralling"" sperm near the entry sites into the storage organs. Genetic studies showed that Acp36DE is also required for a series of conformational changes of the uterus that begin at the onset of mating and are hypothesized to move sperm towards the entry sites of the sperm storage organs. After Acp36DE is transferred to the female RT, the protein is cleaved by the astacin-metalloprotease Semp1. However, the effect of this cleavage on Acp36DE's function in sperm accumulation into storage is unknown. We used mass spectrometry to identify the single cleavage site in Acp36DE. We then mutated this site and tested the effects on sperm storage. Mutations of Acp36DE's cleavage site that slowed or prevented cleavage of the protein slowed the accumulation of sperm into storage, although they did not affect uterine conformational changes in mated females. Moreover, the N-terminal cleavage product of Acp36DE was sufficient to mediate sperm accumulation in storage, and it did so faster than versions of Acp36DE that could not be cleaved or were only cleaved slowly. These results suggest that cleavage of Acp36E may increase the number of bioactive molecules within the female RT, a mechanism similar to that hypothesized for Semp1's other substrate, the seminal fluid protein ovulin.",2017,"Frank W Avila, Mariana F Wolfner, Frank W Avila, Mariana F Wolfner"
Optogenetic Rescue of Locomotor Dysfunction and Dopaminergic Degeneration Caused by Alpha-Synuclein and EKO Genes,28442946,10.5607/en.2017.26.2.97,"α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a small presynaptic protein and its mutant forms (e.g. A53T) are known to be directly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying α-Syn-mediated neurodegeneration in PD still remain to be explored. However, several studies strongly support that overexpression of mutant α-Syn causes reduced release of dopamine (DA) in the brain, and contributes to motor deficits in PD. Using a favorable genetic model Drosophila larva, we examined whether reduced DA release is enough to induce key PD symptoms (i.e. locomotion deficiency and DA neurodegeneration), mimicking a PD gene α-Syn. In order to reduce DA release, we expressed electrical knockout (EKO) gene in DA neurons, which is known to make neurons hypo-excitable. EKO led to a decrease in a DA neuronal marker signal (i.e., TH - tyrosine hydroxylase) and locomotion deficits in Drosophila larva. In contrast, acute and prolonged exposure to blue light (BL, 470 nm) was sufficient to activate channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) and rescue PD symptoms caused by both α-Syn and EKO. We believe this is for the first time to confirm that locomotion defects by a genetic PD factor such as α-Syn can be rescued by increasing DA neuronal excitability with an optogenetic approach. Our findings strongly support that PD is a failure of DA synaptic transmission, which can be rescued by optogenetic activation of ChR2.",2017,"Cheng Qi, Scott Varga, Soo-Jin Oh, C Justin Lee, Daewoo Lee, Cheng Qi, Scott Varga, Soo-Jin Oh, C Justin Lee, Daewoo Lee"
Annealing of Complementary DNA Sequences During Double-Strand Break Repair in Drosophila Is Mediated by the Ortholog of SMARCAL1,28258182,10.1534/genetics.117.200238,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a serious threat to genomic integrity. If unrepaired, they can lead to chromosome fragmentation and cell death. If repaired incorrectly, they can cause mutations and chromosome rearrangements. DSBs are repaired using end-joining or homology-directed repair strategies, with the predominant form of homology-directed repair being synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). SDSA is the first defense against genomic rearrangements and information loss during DSB repair, making it a vital component of cell health and an attractive target for chemotherapeutic development. SDSA has also been proposed to be the primary mechanism for integration of large insertions during genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9. Despite the central role for SDSA in genome stability, little is known about the defining step: annealing. We hypothesized that annealing during SDSA is performed by the annealing helicase SMARCAL1, which can anneal RPA-coated single DNA strands during replication-associated DNA damage repair. We used unique genetic tools in Drosophila melanogaster to test whether the fly ortholog of SMARCAL1, Marcal1, mediates annealing during SDSA. Repair that requires annealing is significantly reduced in Marcal1 null mutants in both synthesis-dependent and synthesis-independent (single-strand annealing) assays. Elimination of the ATP-binding activity of Marcal1 also reduced annealing-dependent repair, suggesting that the annealing activity requires translocation along DNA. Unlike the null mutant, however, the ATP-binding defect mutant showed reduced end joining, shedding light on the interaction between SDSA and end-joining pathways.",2017,"Julie Korda Holsclaw, Jeff Sekelsky, Julie Korda Holsclaw, Jeff Sekelsky"
Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in Drosophila,27702774,10.1093/molbev/msw212,"Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high sequence identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene Sdic originated, and tandemly expanded in Drosophila melanogaster, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel sequencing data, we studied the organization, sequence evolution, and functional attributes of the different Sdic copies. By leveraging long-read sequencing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the Sdic region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the Sdic copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using Sdic knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the Sdic gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.",2017,"Bryan D Clifton, Pablo Librado, Shu-Dan Yeh, Edwin S Solares, Daphne A Real, Suvini U Jayasekera, Wanting Zhang, Mijuan Shi, Ronni V Park, Robert D Magie, Hsiu-Ching Ma, Xiao-Qin Xia, Antonio Marco, Julio Rozas, José M Ranz, Bryan D Clifton, Pablo Librado, Shu-Dan Yeh, Edwin S Solares, Daphne A Real, Suvini U Jayasekera, Wanting Zhang, Mijuan Shi, Ronni V Park, Robert D Magie, Hsiu-Ching Ma, Xiao-Qin Xia, Antonio Marco, Julio Rozas, José M Ranz"

By in situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes combined with high-resolution microscopy, we mapped the boundaries of the 61C7-8 interband and of the 61C7 and C8 band regions, respectively.

It contains several active genes and therefore can be considered as an open chromatin domain. Comparing the 61C7-8 structure of Drosophila S2 cells and polytene salivary gland cells by ChIP for chromatin protein binding and histone modifications, we observe a highly consistent domain structure for the proximal 13 kbp of the domain in both cell types. However, the distal 7 kbp of the open domain differs in protein binding and histone modification between both tissues. The domain contains four protein-coding genes in the proximal part and two noncoding transcripts in the distal part. The differential transcriptional activity of one of the noncoding transcripts correlates with the observed differences in the chromatin structure between both tissues. The significance of our findings for the organization and structure of open chromatin domains will be discussed.",2016,"Thomas Zielke, Alexander Glotov, Harald Saumweber, Thomas Zielke, Alexander Glotov, Harald Saumweber"
Evolution of reduced post-copulatory molecular interactions in Drosophila populations lacking sperm competition,26395588,10.1111/jeb.12763,"In many species with internal fertilization, molecules transferred in the male ejaculate trigger and interact with physiological changes in females. It is controversial to what extent these interactions between the sexes act synergistically to mediate the female switch to a reproductive state or instead reflect sexual antagonism evolved as a by product of sexual selection on males. To address this question, we eliminated sexual selection by enforcing monogamy in populations of Drosophila melanogaster for 65 generations and then measured the expression of male seminal fluid protein genes and genes involved in the female response to mating. In the absence of sperm competition, male and female reproductive interests are perfectly aligned and any antagonism should be reduced by natural selection. Consistent with this idea, males from monogamous populations showed reduced expression of seminal fluid protein genes, 16% less on average than in polygamous males. Further, we identified 428 genes that responded to mating in females. After mating, females with an evolutionary history of monogamy exhibited lower relative expression of genes that were up regulated in response to mating and higher expression of genes that were down-regulated--in other words, their post-mating transcriptome appeared more virgin-like. Surprisingly, these genes showed a similar pattern even before mating, suggesting that monogamous females evolved to be less poised for mating and the accompanying receipt of male seminal fluid proteins. This reduced investment by both monogamous males and females in molecules involved in post-copulatory interactions points to a pervasive role of sexual conflict in shaping these interactions.",2016,"B Hollis, D Houle, T J Kawecki, B Hollis, D Houle, T J Kawecki"
Girdin-mediated interactions between cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton are required for epithelial morphogenesis in Drosophila,25968313,10.1242/dev.122002,"E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is fundamental for epithelial tissue morphogenesis, physiology and repair. E-cadherin is a core transmembrane constituent of the zonula adherens (ZA), a belt-like adherens junction located at the apicolateral border in epithelial cells. The anchorage of ZA components to cortical actin filaments strengthens cell-cell cohesion and allows for junction contractility, which shapes epithelial tissues during development. Here, we report that the cytoskeletal adaptor protein Girdin physically and functionally interacts with components of the cadherin-catenin complex during Drosophila embryogenesis. Fly Girdin is broadly expressed throughout embryonic development and enriched at the ZA in epithelial tissues. Girdin associates with the cytoskeleton and co-precipitates with the cadherin-catenin complex protein α-Catenin (α-Cat). Girdin mutations strongly enhance adhesion defects associated with reduced DE-cadherin (DE-Cad) expression. Moreover, the fraction of DE-Cad molecules associated with the cytoskeleton decreases in the absence of Girdin, thereby identifying Girdin as a positive regulator of adherens junction function. Girdin mutant embryos display isolated epithelial cell cysts and rupture of the ventral midline, consistent with defects in cell-cell cohesion. In addition, loss of Girdin impairs the collective migration of epithelial cells, resulting in dorsal closure defects. We propose that Girdin stabilizes epithelial cell adhesion and promotes morphogenesis by regulating the linkage of the cadherin-catenin complex to the cytoskeleton.",2015,"Elise Houssin, Ulrich Tepass, Patrick Laprise, Elise Houssin, Ulrich Tepass, Patrick Laprise"
Distinct roles of the DmNav and DSC1 channels in the action of DDT and pyrethroids,25687544,10.1016/j.neuro.2015.02.001,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav channels) are critical for electrical signaling in the nervous system and are the primary targets of the insecticides DDT and pyrethroids. In Drosophila melanogaster, besides the canonical Nav channel, Para (also called DmNav), there is a sodium channel-like cation channel called DSC1 (Drosophila sodium channel 1). Temperature-sensitive paralytic mutations in DmNav (para(ts)) confer resistance to DDT and pyrethroids, whereas DSC1 knockout flies exhibit enhanced sensitivity to pyrethroids. To further define the roles and interaction of DmNav and DSC1 channels in DDT and pyrethroid neurotoxicology, we generated a DmNav/DSC1 double mutant line by introducing a para(ts1) allele (carrying the I265N mutation) into a DSC1 knockout line. We confirmed that the I265N mutation reduced the sensitivity to two pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin of a DmNav variant expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Computer modeling predicts that the I265N mutation confers pyrethroid resistance by allosterically altering the second pyrethroid receptor site on the DmNav channel. Furthermore, we found that I265N-mediated pyrethroid resistance in para(ts1) mutant flies was almost completely abolished in para(ts1);DSC1(-/-) double mutant flies. Unexpectedly, however, the DSC1 knockout flies were less sensitive to DDT, compared to the control flies (w(1118A)), and the para(ts1);DSC1(-/-) double mutant flies were even more resistant to DDT compared to the DSC1 knockout or para(ts1) mutant. Our findings revealed distinct roles of the DmNav and DSC1 channels in the neurotoxicology of DDT vs. pyrethroids and implicate the exciting possibility of using DSC1 channel blockers or modifiers in the management of pyrethroid resistance.",2015,"Frank D Rinkevich, Yuzhe Du, Josh Tolinski, Atsushi Ueda, Chun-Fang Wu, Boris S Zhorov, Ke Dong, Frank D Rinkevich, Yuzhe Du, Josh Tolinski, Atsushi Ueda, Chun-Fang Wu, Boris S Zhorov, Ke Dong"

A novel vertebrates TLR counterpart named PcToll, was firstly identified from the freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PcToll together with Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae Toll9 were clustered with human Tolls. PcToll was mainly expressed in hepatopancreas and gills and it also could be detected in hemocytes, heart, stomach and intestine. PcToll was upregulated in hemocytes and gills post 24 h Vibrio anguillarum challenge. In hepatopancreas and intestine, the highest expression level of PcToll could be observed at 12 h V. anguillarum challenge. In hemocytes, PcToll went up post 24 h Staphylococcus aureus challenge and in gills, the expression level of PcToll showed no obvious change from 2 to 24 h S. aureus challenge. In hepatopancreas post 12 h S. aureus challenge, PcToll was upregulated and it showed obvious upregulation post 12 h S. aureus challenge in intestine. RNAi results showed that PcToll was involved in regulation of crustins (Cru1, Cru2), anti-lipopolysaccharide factor 2 (ALF2) and lysozyme 1 (Lys1) expression. Overexpression of PcToll in Drosophila S2 cells could induce Drosophila Attacin (Atta), Metchnikowin (Mtk), Drosomycin (Drs) and shrimp Penaeidin (PEN4) expression. From the results, it could be speculated that PcToll might play important roles in crayfish innate immune defense.",2015,"Zheng Wang, Yi-Hong Chen, Yun-Jia Dai, Jing-Min Tan, Ying Huang, Jiang-Feng Lan, Qian Ren, Zheng Wang, Yi-Hong Chen, Yun-Jia Dai, Jing-Min Tan, Ying Huang, Jiang-Feng Lan, Qian Ren"
A re-examination of the selection of the sensory organ precursor of the bristle sensilla of Drosophila melanogaster,25569355,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004911,"The bristle sensillum of the imago of Drosophila is made of four cells that arise from a sensory organ precursor cell (SOP). This SOP is selected within proneural clusters (PNC) through a mechanism that involves Notch signalling. PNCs are defined through the expression domains of the proneural genes, whose activities enables cells to become SOPs. They encode tissue specific bHLH proteins that form functional heterodimers with the bHLH protein Daughterless (Da). In the prevailing lateral inhibition model for SOP selection, a transcriptional feedback loop that involves the Notch pathway amplifies small differences of proneural activity between cells of the PNC. As a result only one or two cells accumulate sufficient proneural activity to adopt the SOP fate. Most of the experiments that sustained the prevailing lateral inhibition model were performed a decade ago. We here re-examined the selection process using recently available reagents. Our data suggest a different picture of SOP selection. They indicate that a band-like region of proneural activity exists. In this proneural band the activity of the Notch pathway is required in combination with Emc to define the PNCs. We found a sub-group in the PNCs from which a pre-selected SOP arises. Our data indicate that most imaginal disc cells are able to adopt a proneural state from which they can progress to become SOPs. They further show that bristle formation can occur in the absence of the proneural genes if the function of emc is abolished. These results suggest that the tissue specific proneural proteins of Drosophila have a similar function as in the vertebrates, which is to determine the time of emergence and position of the SOP and to stabilise the proneural state.",2015,"Tobias Troost, Markus Schneider, Thomas Klein, Tobias Troost, Markus Schneider, Thomas Klein"
LC-MS-based urinary metabolite signatures in idiopathic Parkinson's disease,25271123,10.1021/pr500807t,"Increasing evidence has shown that abnormal metabolic phenotypes in body fluids reflect the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). These body fluids include urine; however, the relationship between, specifically, urinary metabolic phenotypes and PD is not fully understood. In this study, urinary metabolites from a total of 401 clinical urine samples collected from 106 idiopathic PD patients and 104 normal control subjects were profiled by using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Our study revealed significant correlation between clinical phenotype and urinary metabolite profile. Metabolic profiles of idiopathic PD patients differed significantly and consistently from normal controls, with related metabolic pathway variations observed in steroidogenesis, fatty acid beta-oxidation, histidine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and tyrosine metabolism. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the alteration of the kynurenine pathway in tryptophan metabolism corresponded with pathogenic changes in the alpha-synuclein overexpressed Drosophila model of PD. The results suggest that LC-MS-based urinary metabolomic profiling can reveal the metabolite signatures and related variations in metabolic pathways that characterize PD.

Evolution in an ancient detoxification pathway is coupled with a transition to herbivory in the drosophilidae,24974374,10.1093/molbev/msu201,"Chemically defended plant tissues present formidable barriers to herbivores. Although mechanisms to resist plant defenses have been identified in ancient herbivorous lineages, adaptations to overcome plant defenses during transitions to herbivory remain relatively unexplored. The fly genus Scaptomyza is nested within the genus Drosophila and includes species that feed on the living tissue of mustard plants (Brassicaceae), yet this lineage is derived from microbe-feeding ancestors. We found that mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species and microbe-feeding Drosophila melanogaster detoxify mustard oils, the primary chemical defenses in the Brassicaceae, using the widely conserved mercapturic acid pathway. This detoxification strategy differs from other specialist herbivores of mustard plants, which possess derived mechanisms to obviate mustard oil formation. To investigate whether mustard feeding is coupled with evolution in the mercapturic acid pathway, we profiled functional and molecular evolutionary changes in the enzyme glutathione S-transferase D1 (GSTD1), which catalyzes the first step of the mercapturic acid pathway and is induced by mustard defense products in Scaptomyza. GSTD1 acquired elevated activity against mustard oils in one mustard-feeding Scaptomyza species in which GstD1 was duplicated. Structural analysis and mutagenesis revealed that substitutions at conserved residues within and near the substrate-binding cleft account for most of this increase in activity against mustard oils. Functional evolution of GSTD1 was coupled with signatures of episodic positive selection in GstD1 after the evolution of herbivory. Overall, we found that preexisting functions of generalized detoxification systems, and their refinement by natural selection, could play a central role in the evolution of herbivory.",2014,"Andrew D Gloss, Daniel G Vassão, Alexander L Hailey, Anna C Nelson Dittrich, Katharina Schramm, Michael Reichelt, Timothy J Rast, Andrzej Weichsel, Matthew G Cravens, Jonathan Gershenzon, William R Montfort, Noah K Whiteman, Andrew D Gloss, Daniel G Vassão, Alexander L Hailey, Anna C Nelson Dittrich, Katharina Schramm, Michael Reichelt, Timothy J Rast, Andrzej Weichsel, Matthew G Cravens, Jonathan Gershenzon, William R Montfort, Noah K Whiteman"
Efficient chromosomal gene modification with CRISPR/cas9 and PCR-based homologous recombination donors in cultured Drosophila cells,24748663,10.1093/nar/gku289,"The ability to edit the genome is essential for many state-of-the-art experimental paradigms. Since DNA breaks stimulate repair, they can be exploited to target site-specific integration. The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes has been harnessed into an efficient and programmable nuclease for eukaryotic cells. We thus combined DNA cleavage by cas9, the generation of homologous recombination donors by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transient depletion of the non-homologous end joining factor lig4. Using cultured Drosophila melanogaster S2-cells and the phosphoglycerate kinase gene as a model, we reached targeted integration frequencies of up to 50% in drug-selected cell populations. Homology arms as short as 29 nt appended to the PCR primer resulted in detectable integration, slightly longer extensions are beneficial. We confirmed established rules for S. pyogenes cas9 sgRNA design and demonstrate that the complementarity region allows length variation and 5'-extensions. This enables generation of U6-promoter fusion templates by overlap-extension PCR with a standardized protocol. We present a series of PCR template vectors for C-terminal protein tagging and clonal Drosophila S2 cell lines with stable expression of a myc-tagged cas9 protein.

The Drosophila Werner exonuclease participates in an exonuclease-independent response to replication stress,24709634,10.1534/genetics.114.164228,"Members of the RecQ family of helicases are known for their roles in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. Mutations in the human RecQ helicases, WRN and BLM, cause Werner and Bloom syndromes, which are diseases characterized by genome instability and an increased risk of cancer. While WRN contains both a helicase and an exonuclease domain, the Drosophila melanogaster homolog, WRNexo, contains only the exonuclease domain. Therefore the Drosophila model system provides a unique opportunity to study the exonuclease functions of WRN separate from the helicase. We created a null allele of WRNexo via imprecise P-element excision. The null WRNexo mutants are not sensitive to double-strand break-inducing reagents, suggesting that the exonuclease does not play a key role in homologous recombination-mediated repair of DSBs. However, WRNexo mutant embryos have a reduced hatching frequency and larvae are sensitive to the replication fork-stalling reagent, hydroxyurea (HU), suggesting that WRNexo is important in responding to replication stress. The role of WRNexo in the HU-induced stress response is independent of Rad51. Interestingly, the hatching defect and HU sensitivity of WRNexo mutants do not occur in flies containing an exonuclease-dead copy of WRNexo, suggesting that the role of WRNexo in replication is independent of exonuclease activity. Additionally, WRNexo and Blm mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to HU and synthetic lethality in combination with mutations in structure-selective endonucleases. We propose that WRNexo and BLM interact to promote fork reversal following replication fork stalling and in their absence regressed forks are restarted through a Rad51-mediated process.",2014,"Elyse Bolterstein, Rachel Rivero, Melissa Marquez, Mitch McVey, Elyse Bolterstein, Rachel Rivero, Melissa Marquez, Mitch McVey"
Coordinated metabolic transitions during Drosophila embryogenesis and the onset of aerobic glycolysis,24622332,10.1534/g3.114.010652,"Rapidly proliferating cells such as cancer cells and embryonic stem cells rely on a specialized metabolic program known as aerobic glycolysis, which supports biomass production from carbohydrates. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster also utilizes aerobic glycolysis to support the rapid growth that occurs during larval development. Here we use singular value decomposition analysis of modENCODE RNA-seq data combined with GC-MS-based metabolomic analysis to analyze the changes in gene expression and metabolism that occur during Drosophila embryogenesis, spanning the onset of aerobic glycolysis. Unexpectedly, we find that the most common pattern of co-expressed genes in embryos includes the global switch to glycolytic gene expression that occurs midway through embryogenesis. In contrast to the canonical aerobic glycolytic pathway, however, which is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, the expression of genes involved in the tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle) and the electron transport chain are also upregulated at this time. Mitochondrial activity, however, appears to be attenuated, as embryos exhibit a block in the TCA cycle that results in elevated levels of citrate, isocitrate, and α-ketoglutarate. We also find that genes involved in lipid breakdown and β-oxidation are upregulated prior to the transcriptional initiation of glycolysis, but are downregulated before the onset of larval development, revealing coordinated use of lipids and carbohydrates during development. These observations demonstrate the efficient use of nutrient stores to support embryonic development, define sequential metabolic transitions during this stage, and demonstrate striking similarities between the metabolic state of late-stage fly embryos and tumor cells.",2014,"Jason M Tennessen, Nicolas M Bertagnolli, Janelle Evans, Matt H Sieber, James Cox, Carl S Thummel, Jason M Tennessen, Nicolas M Bertagnolli, Janelle Evans, Matt H Sieber, James Cox, Carl S Thummel"
Feature detection and orientation tuning in the Drosophila central complex,24107996,10.1038/nature12601,"Many animals, including insects, are known to use visual landmarks to orient in their environment. In Drosophila melanogaster, behavioural genetics studies have identified a higher brain structure called the central complex as being required for the fly's innate responses to vertical visual features and its short- and long-term memory for visual patterns. But whether and how neurons of the fly central complex represent visual features are unknown. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed walking and flying flies to probe visuomotor responses of ring neurons--a class of central complex neurons that have been implicated in landmark-driven spatial memory in walking flies and memory for visual patterns in tethered flying flies. We show that dendrites of ring neurons are visually responsive and arranged retinotopically. Ring neuron receptive fields comprise both excitatory and inhibitory subfields, resembling those of simple cells in the mammalian primary visual cortex. Ring neurons show strong and, in some cases, direction-selective orientation tuning, with a notable preference for vertically oriented features similar to those that evoke innate responses in flies. Visual responses were diminished during flight, but, in contrast with the hypothesized role of the central complex in the control of locomotion, not modulated during walking. Taken together, these results indicate that ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features in the fly's environment, enabling downstream central complex circuits to produce appropriate motor commands. More broadly, this study opens the door to mechanistic investigations of circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection in the Drosophila central complex.",2013,"Johannes D Seelig, Vivek Jayaraman, Johannes D Seelig, Vivek Jayaraman"
Specific Cooperation Between Imp-α2 and Imp-β/Ketel in Spindle Assembly During Drosophila Early Nuclear Divisions,22384376,10.1534/g3.111.001073,"The multifunctional factors Imp-α and Imp-β are involved in nuclear protein import, mitotic spindle dynamics, and nuclear membrane formation. Furthermore, each of the three members of the Imp-α family exerts distinct tasks during development. In Drosophila melanogaster, the imp-α2 gene is critical during oogenesis for ring canal assembly; specific mutations, which allow oogenesis to proceed normally, were found to block early embryonic mitosis. Here, we show that imp-α2 and imp-β genetically interact during early embryonic development, and we characterize the pattern of defects affecting mitosis in embryos laid by heterozygous imp-α2(D14) and imp-β(KetRE34) females. Embryonic development is arrested in these embryos but is unaffected in combinations between imp-β(KetRE34) and null mutations in imp-α1 or imp-α3. Furthermore, the imp-α2(D14)/imp-β(KetRE34) interaction could only be rescued by an imp-α2 transgene, albeit not imp-α1 or imp-α3, showing the exclusive imp-α2 function with imp-β. Use of transgenes carrying modifications in the major Imp-α2 domains showed the critical requirement of the nuclear localization signal binding (NLSB) site in this process. In the mutant embryos, we found metaphase-arrested mitoses made of enlarged spindles, suggesting an unrestrained activity of factors promoting spindle assembly. In accordance with this, we found that Imp-β(KetRE34) and Imp-β(KetD) bind a high level of RanGTP/GDP, and a deletion decreasing RanGTP level suppresses the imp-β(KetRE34) phenotype. These data suggest that a fine balance among Imp-α2, Imp-β, RanGTP, and the NLS cargos is critical for mitotic progression during early embryonic development.",2012,"Erika Virágh, Mátyás Gorjánácz, István Török, Tolga Eichhorn, Sowjanya Kallakuri, Tamás Szlanka, István Kiss, Bernard M Mechler, Erika Virágh, Mátyás Gorjánácz, István Török, Tolga Eichhorn, Sowjanya Kallakuri, Tamás Szlanka, István Kiss, Bernard M Mechler"
Mammalian Hippo signalling: a kinase network regulated by protein-protein interactions,22260677,10.1042/BST20110619,"The Hippo signal transduction cascade controls cell growth, proliferation and death, all of which are frequently deregulated in tumour cells. Since initial studies in Drosophila melanogaster were instrumental in defining Hippo signalling, the machinery was named after the central Ste20-like kinase Hippo. Moreover, given that loss of Hippo signalling components Hippo, Warts, and Mats resulted in uncontrolled tissue overgrowth, Hippo signalling was defined as a tumour-suppressor cascade. Significantly, all of the core factors of Hippo signalling have mammalian orthologues that functionally compensate for loss of their counterparts in Drosophila. Furthermore, studies in Drosophila and mammalian cell systems showed that Hippo signalling represents a kinase cascade that is tightly regulated by PPIs (protein-protein interactions). Several Hippo signalling molecules contain SARAH (Salvador/RASSF1A/Hippo) domains that mediate specific PPIs, thereby influencing the activities of MST1/2 (mammalian Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase 1/2) kinases, the human Hippo orthologues. Moreover, WW domains are present in several Hippo factors, and these domains also serve as interaction surfaces for regulatory PPIs in Hippo signalling. Finally, the kinase activities of LATS1/2 (large tumour-suppressor kinase 1/2), the human counterparts of Warts, are controlled by binding to hMOB1 (human Mps one binder protein 1), the human Mats. Therefore Hippo signalling is regulated by PPIs on several levels.

A distinct set of Drosophila brain neurons required for neurofibromatosis type 1-dependent learning and memory,20668197,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0283-10.2010,"Nonspecific cognitive impairments are one of the many manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A learning phenotype is also present in Drosophila melanogaster that lack a functional neurofibromin gene (nf1). Multiple studies have indicated that Nf1-dependent learning in Drosophila involves the cAMP pathway, including the demonstration of a genetic interaction between Nf1 and the rutabaga-encoded adenylyl cyclase (Rut-AC). Olfactory classical conditioning experiments have previously demonstrated a requirement for Rut-AC activity and downstream cAMP pathway signaling in neurons of the mushroom bodies. However, Nf1 expression in adult mushroom body neurons has not been observed. Here, we address this discrepancy by demonstrating (1) that Rut-AC is required for the acquisition and stability of olfactory memories, whereas Nf1 is only required for acquisition, (2) that expression of nf1 RNA can be detected in the cell bodies of mushroom body neurons, and (3) that expression of an nf1 transgene only in the alpha/beta subset of mushroom body neurons is sufficient to restore both protein synthesis-independent and protein synthesis-dependent memory. Our observations indicate that memory-related functions of Rut-AC are both Nf1-dependent and -independent, that Nf1 mediates the formation of two distinct memory components within a single neuron population, and that our understanding of Nf1 function in memory processes may be dissected from its role in other brain functions by specifically studying the alpha/beta mushroom body neurons.",2010,"Monica E Buchanan, Ronald L Davis, Monica E Buchanan, Ronald L Davis"
Targeted manipulation of serotonergic neurotransmission affects the escalation of aggression in adult male Drosophila melanogaster,20520823,10.1371/journal.pone.0010806,"Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) are reported to serve important roles in aggression in a wide variety of animals. Previous investigations of 5HT function in adult Drosophila behavior have relied on pharmacological manipulations, or on combinations of genetic tools that simultaneously target both DA and 5HT neurons. Here, we generated a transgenic line that allows selective, direct manipulation of serotonergic neurons and asked whether DA and 5HT have separable effects on aggression. Quantitative morphological examination demonstrated that our newly generated tryptophan hydroxylase (TRH)-Gal4 driver line was highly selective for 5HT-containing neurons. This line was used in conjunction with already available Gal4 driver lines that target DA or both DA and 5HT neurons to acutely alter the function of aminergic systems. First, we showed that acute impairment of DA and 5HT neurotransmission using expression of a temperature sensitive form of dynamin completely abolished mid- and high-level aggression. These flies did not escalate fights beyond brief low-intensity interactions and therefore did not yield dominance relationships. We showed next that manipulation of either 5HT or DA neurotransmission failed to duplicate this phenotype. Selective disruption of 5HT neurotransmission yielded flies that fought, but with reduced ability to escalate fights, leading to fewer dominance relationships. Acute activation of 5HT neurons using temperature sensitive dTrpA1 channel expression, in contrast, resulted in flies that escalated fights faster and that fought at higher intensities. Finally, acute disruption of DA neurotransmission produced hyperactive flies that moved faster than controls, and rarely engaged in any social interactions. By separately manipulating 5HT- and DA- neuron systems, we collected evidence demonstrating a direct role for 5HT in the escalation of aggression in Drosophila.",2010,"Olga V Alekseyenko, Carol Lee, Edward A Kravitz, Olga V Alekseyenko, Carol Lee, Edward A Kravitz"
Effects of lithium chloride on the gene expression profiles in Drosophila heads,19410610,10.1016/j.neures.2009.04.015,"To gain insight into the basic neurobiological processes regulated by lithium--an effective drug for bipolar disorder--we used Affymetrix Genome Arrays to examine lithium-induced changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles of head mRNA from the genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster. First, to identify the individual genes whose transcript levels are most significantly altered by lithium, we analyzed the microarray data with stringent criteria (fold change>2; p<0.001) and evaluated the results by RT-PCR. This analysis identified 12 genes that encode proteins with various biological functions, including an enzyme responsible for amino acid metabolism and a putative amino acid transporter. Second, to uncover the biological pathways involved in lithium's action in the nervous system, we used less stringent criteria (fold change>1.2; FDR<0.05) and assigned the identified 66 lithium-responsive genes to biological pathways using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). The gene ontology categories most significantly affected by lithium were amino acid metabolic processes.

Posttranslational regulation of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 in the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis,19339503,10.1104/pp.109.137414,"As an adaptation to life in a world with predictable daily changes, most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes have endogenous circadian (approximately 24 h) clocks. In plants, the circadian clock regulates a diverse range of cellular and physiological events from gene expression and protein phosphorylation to cellular calcium oscillations, hypocotyl growth, leaf movements, and photoperiod-dependent flowering. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), as in other model organisms, such as Drosophila (Drosophila melanogaster) and mice, circadian rhythms are generated by molecular oscillators that consist of interlocking feedback loops involving a number of elements. CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS (LHY) are closely related single myb transcription factors that have been identified as key elements in the Arabidopsis oscillator. Research in other model organisms has shown that posttranslational regulation of oscillator components plays a critical role in the generation of the approximately 24-h cycles. To examine the role of posttranslational regulation of CCA1 and LHY in the Arabidopsis oscillator, we generated transgenic plants with tagged CCA1 and LHY under the control of their own promoters. We have shown that these tagged proteins are functional and can restore normal circadian rhythms to CCA1- and LHY-null plants. Using the tagged proteins, we demonstrate that CCA1 can form both homodimers and heterodimers with LHY. Furthermore, we also show that CCA1 is localized to the nucleus in vivo and that there is no significant delay between the translation of CCA1 and its translocation to the nucleus.

As analyzed by confocal microscopy, S2MtEGFP cell cultures were shown to be quite heterogeneous regarding the intensity and cell localization of fluorescence among the EGFP expressing cells. Spectrofluorimetry kinetic studies of CuSO(4) induced S2MtEGFP cells showed the EGFP expression at 510 nm as soon as 5 h after induction, the fluorescence increasing progressively from this time to attain values of 4.6 x 10(5) counts/s after 72 h of induction. Induction with 700 muM of CuSO(4) performed at the exponential phase of the S2MtEGFP culture (10(6) cells/mL) led to a better performance in terms of cell growth, percent of fluorescent cells and culture intensity of fluorescence. Sodium butyrate (NaBu) treatment of CuSO(4) induced S2MtEGFP cell cultures, although leading to a loss of cell culture viability, increased the percent of EGFP expressing cells and sharply enhanced the cell culture fluorescence intensity. The present study established parameters for improving heterologous protein expression in stably transfected Drosophila S2 cells, as assessed by the EGFP expression.",2007,"Mariza G Santos, Soraia A C Jorge, Karl Brillet, Carlos A Pereira, Mariza G Santos, Soraia A C Jorge, Karl Brillet, Carlos A Pereira"
Drosophila lifespan control by dietary restriction independent of insulin-like signaling,18221413,10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00373.x,"Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling may be a natural way for the reduction of dietary nutrients to extend lifespan. While evidence challenging this hypothesis is accumulating with Caenorhabditis elegans, for Drosophila melanogaster it is still thought that insulin/IGF and the mechanisms of dietary restriction (DR) might as yet function through overlapping mechanisms. Here, we aim to understand this potential overlap. We found that over-expression of dFOXO in head fat body extends lifespan and reduces steady-state mRNA abundance of insulin-like peptide-2 under conditions of high dietary yeast, but not when yeast is limiting. In contrast, conditions of DR that increase lifespan change only insulin-like peptide-5 (ilp5) mRNA abundance. Thus, reduction of ilp5 mRNA is associated with longevity extension by DR, while reduction of insulin-like peptide-2 is associated with the diet-dependent effects of FOXO over-expression upon lifespan. To assess whether reduction of ilp5 is required for DR to extend lifespan, we blocked its diet-dependent change with RNAi. Loss of the ilp5 dietary response did not diminish the capacity of DR to extend lifespan. Finally, we assessed the capacity of DR to extend lifespan in the absence of dFOXO, the insulin/IGF-responsive transcription factor. As with the knockdown of ilp5 diet responsiveness, DR was equally effective among genotypes with and without dFOXO. It is clear from many Drosophila studies that insulin/IGF mediates growth and metabolic responses to nutrition, but we now find no evidence that this endocrine system mediates the interaction between dietary yeast and longevity extension.",2008,"Kyung-Jin Min, Rochele Yamamoto, Susanne Buch, Michael Pankratz, Marc Tatar, Kyung-Jin Min, Rochele Yamamoto, Susanne Buch, Michael Pankratz, Marc Tatar"
Roles for Drosophila melanogaster myosin IB in maintenance of enterocyte brush-border structure and resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila,17855510,10.1091/mbc.e07-02-0191,"Drosophila myosin IB (Myo1B) is one of two class I myosins in the Drosophila genome. In the larval and adult midgut enterocyte, Myo1B is present within the microvillus (MV) of the apical brush border (BB) where it forms lateral tethers between the MV membrane and underlying actin filament core. Expression of green fluorescent protein-Myo1B tail domain in the larval gut showed that the tail domain is sufficient for localization of Myo1B to the BB. A Myo1B deletion mutation exhibited normal larval gut physiology with respect to food uptake, clearance, and pH regulation. However, there is a threefold increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive enterocyte nuclei in the Myo1B mutant. Ultrastructural analysis of mutant midgut revealed many perturbations in the BB, including membrane tethering defects, MV vesiculation, and membrane shedding. The apical localization of both singed (fascin) and Dmoesin is impaired. BBs isolated from mutant and control midgut revealed that the loss of Myo1B causes the BB membrane and underlying cytoskeleton to become destabilized. Myo1B mutant larvae also exhibit enhanced sensitivity to oral infection by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila, and severe cytoskeletal defects are observed in the BB of proximal midgut epithelial cells soon after infection. Resistance to P. entomophila infection is restored in Myo1B mutant larvae expressing a Myo1B transgene. These results indicate that Myo1B may play a role in the local midgut response pathway of the Imd innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection.",2007,"Peter S Hegan, Valerie Mermall, Lewis G Tilney, Mark S Mooseker, Peter S Hegan, Valerie Mermall, Lewis G Tilney, Mark S Mooseker"
A role for the molecular chaperone protein BiP/GRP78 in Drosophila sleep homeostasis,17552370,10.1093/sleep/30.5.557,"Study objectives:
      
    

    
      Microarray studies have identified numerous genes that change in response to prolonged wakefulness. The challenge is to determine which transcriptional changes translate into protein changes that are critical for recovery following sleep loss. BiP is a protein indicator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and BiP mRNA increases in mouse and rat cerebral cortex and in Drosophila heads in response to sleep loss. We first sought to determine whether the expression of BiP protein parallels sleep homeostatic drive and dissipates with recovery sleep. We then sought to establish a key role for BiP in the homeostatic process of sleep by contrasting recovery sleep in models of over- and under-expression of BiP.
    

    
  


        Subjects and interventions:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster were used to take advantage of the UAS-Gal4 system to both over express wild-type BiP and express a dominant negative form of BiP.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      BiP protein rises two and a half fold across sleep loss and falls in recovery sleep, in parallel with gene changes. BiP over expression in the flies leads to an increase in recovery sleep in response to sleep loss, in parallel with a delay in the unfolded protein response. Flies with the dominant negative mutation and reduced functional BiP show the opposite effect.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      We show directly that BiP protein, a key indicator of ER stress is instrumental in determining the amount of recovery sleep following enforced wakefulness. We have thus identified a novel window into regulation of sleep homeostasis.",2007,"Nirinjini Naidoo, Vincent Casiano, Jacqueline Cater, John Zimmerman, Allan I Pack, Nirinjini Naidoo, Vincent Casiano, Jacqueline Cater, John Zimmerman, Allan I Pack"
Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in Drosophila,17409186,10.1073/pnas.0701572104,"We have estimated the selective effects of amino acid replacements in natural populations by comparing levels of polymorphism in 91 genes in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster with their divergence from Drosophila simulans. The genes include about equal numbers whose level of expression in adults is greater in males, greater in females, or approximately equal in the sexes. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample key parameters in the stationary distribution of polymorphism and divergence in a model in which the selective effect of each nonsynonymous mutation is regarded as a random sample from some underlying normal distribution whose mean may differ from one gene to the next. Our analysis suggests that approximately 95% of all nonsynonymous mutations that could contribute to polymorphism or divergence are deleterious, and that the average proportion of deleterious amino acid polymorphisms in samples is approximately 70%. On the other hand, approximately 95% of fixed differences between species are positively selected, although the scaled selection coefficient (N(e)s) is very small. We estimate that approximately 46% of amino acid replacements have N(e)s < 2, approximately 84% have N(e)s < 4, and approximately 99% have N(e)s < 7. Although positive selection among amino acid differences between species seems pervasive, most of the selective effects could be regarded as nearly neutral. There are significant differences in selection between sex-biased and unbiased genes, which relate primarily to the mean of the distributions of mutational effects and the fraction of slightly deleterious and weakly beneficial mutations that are fixed.",2007,"Stanley A Sawyer, John Parsch, Zhi Zhang, Daniel L Hartl, Stanley A Sawyer, John Parsch, Zhi Zhang, Daniel L Hartl"
Global analysis of X-chromosome dosage compensation,16507155,10.1186/jbiol30,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster females have two X chromosomes and two autosome sets (XX;AA), while males have a single X chromosome and two autosome sets (X;AA). Drosophila male somatic cells compensate for a single copy of the X chromosome by deploying male-specific-lethal (MSL) complexes that increase transcription from the X chromosome. Male germ cells lack MSL complexes, indicating that either germline X-chromosome dosage compensation is MSL-independent, or that germ cells do not carry out dosage compensation.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      To investigate whether dosage compensation occurs in germ cells, we directly assayed X-chromosome transcripts using DNA microarrays and show equivalent expression in XX;AA and X;AA germline tissues. In X;AA germ cells, expression from the single X chromosome is about twice that of a single autosome. This mechanism ensures balanced X-chromosome expression between the sexes and, more importantly, it ensures balanced expression between the single X chromosome and the autosome set. Oddly, the inactivation of an X chromosome in mammalian females reduces the effective X-chromosome dose and means that females face the same X-chromosome transcript deficiency as males. Contrary to most current dosage-compensation models, we also show increased X-chromosome expression in X;AA and XX;AA somatic cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Drosophila germ cells compensate for X-chromosome dose. This occurs by equilibrating X-chromosome and autosome expression in X;AA cells. Increased expression of the X chromosome in X;AA individuals appears to be phylogenetically conserved.",2006,"Vaijayanti Gupta, Michael Parisi, David Sturgill, Rachel Nuttall, Michael Doctolero, Olga K Dudko, James D Malley, P Scott Eastman, Brian Oliver, Vaijayanti Gupta, Michael Parisi, David Sturgill, Rachel Nuttall, Michael Doctolero, Olga K Dudko, James D Malley, P Scott Eastman, Brian Oliver"
"Human, Drosophila, and C.elegans TDP43: nucleic acid binding properties and splicing regulatory function",15826655,10.1016/j.jmb.2005.02.038,"TAR DNA binding protein (TDP43), a highly conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, was found to down-regulate splicing of the exon 9 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) through specific binding to a UG-rich polymorphic region upstream of the 3' splice site. Despite the emergence of new information regarding the protein's nuclear localization and splicing regulatory activity, TDP43's role in cells remains elusive. To investigate the function of human TDP43 and its homologues, we cloned and characterized the proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The proteins from human, fly, and worm show striking similarities in their nucleic acid binding specificity. We found that residues at two different positions, which show a strong conservation among TDP43 family members, are linked to the tight recognition of the target sequence. Our three-dimensional model of TDP43 in complex with a (UG)(m) sequence predicts that these residues make amino acid side-chain to base contacts. Moreover, our results suggest that Drosophila TDP43 is comparable to human TDP43 in regulating exon splicing. On the other hand, C.elegans TDP43 has no effect on exon recognition. TDP43 from C.elegans lacks the glycine-rich domain found at the carboxy terminus of the other two homologues. Mutants of human and fly TDP43 devoid of the C-terminal domain are likewise unable to affect splicing.

Drosophila glucosylceramide synthase: a negative regulator of cell death mediated by proapoptotic factors,15210713,10.1074/jbc.M400444200,"Glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT-1) catalyzes the formation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), the core structure of major glycosphingolipids (GSLs), from ceramide and UDP-glucose. Ceramide and its metabolites, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, are now known to be important mediators of apoptosis and cell survival. Recently, we have shown that GlcT-1 functions to regulate intracellular ceramide levels via glycosylation of ceramide. In this study, we employ the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for understanding the in vivo roles of GlcT-1. We isolated and characterized a GlcT-1 homologue (DGlcT-1) from Drosophila. When DGlcT-1 was expressed in GM-95 cells deficient in GSLs (because of the absence of GlcT-1 activity), these cells regained the ability to synthesize GSLs. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the expression of DGlcT-1 mRNA was ubiquitous throughout development, suggesting that DGlcT-1 is important for development and differentiation. Indeed, RNA interference experiments demonstrated that the loss of GlcT-1 function enhances apoptotic cell death. Conversely, targeted expression of GlcT-1 partially rescued cell death caused by the proapoptotic factors Reaper and Grim, suggesting that ceramide generation might be one signal pathway that executes the cell death program. We also found that GlcT-1 localized not only in the Golgi apparatus but also in the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, providing the first visual evidence of GlcT-1 in membranes.

A Drosophila temperature-sensitive seizure mutant in phosphoglycerate kinase disrupts ATP generation and alters synaptic function,15140922,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0542-04.2004,"A novel paralytic mutant, nubian, was identified in a behavioral screen for conditional temperature-sensitive seizure mutants in Drosophila melanogaster. nubian mutants display reduced lifespan, abnormal motor behavior, altered synaptic structure, and defective neurotransmitter release. The nubian mutant disrupts phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), an enzyme required for ATP generation in the terminal stage of the glycolytic pathway. Consistent with altered ATP generation in nubian animals, brain extracts show a threefold reduction in resting ATP levels compared with controls. Microarray analysis of nubian mutants reveals altered transcription of genes implicated in glucose and lipid metabolism. Disruption of ATP generation in nubian animals is accompanied by temperature-dependent defects in neuronal activity, with initial seizure activity, followed by an activity-dependent loss of synaptic transmission. nubian mutants also display structural defects at the synapse, with larger varicosity size but normal varicosity number, indicating that these synaptic parameters are regulated independently. Both exocytotic (NSF) and endocytotic (dynamin) ATPase/GTPase activity are required for normal synaptic transmission. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicate that synaptic defects in nubian animals are secondary to defective endocytosis, suggesting that endocytotic pathways may be generally more sensitive to altered ATP levels than those used for exocytosis. Alterations in ATP metabolism likely disrupt similar pathways in humans, because PGK deficiency is associated with mental retardation, seizures, and exercise intolerance. Given the behavioral similarities between disruptions of PGK function in Drosophila and humans, the analysis of nubian animals may reveal conserved neuronal responses associated with altered ATP generation within the brain.",2004,"Ping Wang, Sudipta Saraswati, Zhuo Guan, Carol J Watkins, Richard J Wurtman, J Troy Littleton, Ping Wang, Sudipta Saraswati, Zhuo Guan, Carol J Watkins, Richard J Wurtman, J Troy Littleton"
A triple mutant of the Drosophila ERR confers ligand-induced suppression of activity,12767224,10.1021/bi027279b,"The steroid hormone (NR3) subfamily of nuclear receptors was until recently believed to be restricted to deuterostomes. However, a novel nuclear receptor belonging to the NR3 subfamily was recently identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome, indicating the existence of an ancestor before the evolutionary split of deuterostomes and protostomes. This receptor, termed the Drosophila estrogen-related receptor (dERR), most closely resembles the human and mouse estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in both the DNA binding domain (DBD) (approximately 85% identical) and the ligand binding domain (LBD) (approximately 35% identical). Here we describe the functional analysis and rational design of ligand responsive dERR mutants created by protein engineering of the LBD. On the basis of homology modeling, three amino acid residues in the LBD were identified and mutated to enable ligand-dependent suppression of transcriptional activity. Our results show that the Y295A/T333I/Y365L triple mutant is significantly suppressed by the known ERR inverse agonists 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), in comparison to the wild-type dERR receptor, which was inefficiently suppressed by these substances. The coactivator mGRIP-1 (mouse glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1) was shown to significantly increase the activity of the triple mutant in transfection experiments, and the addition of OHT resulted in an efficient suppression of the activity. Accordingly, the ability to functionally interact with a coactivator is still maintained by the Y295A/T333I/Y365L mutant.

JAK signaling is somatically required for follicle cell differentiation in Drosophila,11830571,,"Janus kinase (JAK) pathway activity is an integral part of signaling through a variety of ligands and receptors in mammals. The extensive re-utilization and pleiotropy of this pathway in vertebrate development is conserved in other animals as well. In Drosophila melanogaster, JAK signaling has been implicated in embryonic pattern formation, sex determination, larval blood cell development, wing venation, planar polarity in the eye, and formation of other adult structures. Here we describe several roles for JAK signaling in Drosophila oogenesis. The gene for a JAK pathway ligand, unpaired, is expressed specifically in the polar follicle cells, two pairs of somatic cells at the anterior and posterior poles of the developing egg chamber. Consistent with unpaired expression, reduced JAK pathway activity results in the fusion of developing egg chambers. A primary defect of these chambers is the expansion of the polar cell population and concomitant loss of interfollicular stalk cells. These phenotypes are enhanced by reduction of unpaired activity, suggesting that Unpaired is a necessary ligand for the JAK pathway in oogenesis. Mosaic analysis of both JAK pathway transducers, hopscotch and Stat92E, reveals that JAK signaling is specifically required in the somatic follicle cells. Moreover, JAK activity is also necessary for the initial commitment of epithelial follicle cells. Many of these roles are in common with, but distinct from, the known functions of Notch signaling in oogenesis. Consistent with these data is a model in which Notch signaling determines a pool of cells to be competent to adopt stalk or polar fate, while JAK signaling assigns specific identity within that competent pool.",2002,"Jennifer R McGregor, Rongwen Xi, Douglas A Harrison, Jennifer R McGregor, Rongwen Xi, Douglas A Harrison"
Cell-cell adhesion via the ECM: integrin genetics in fly and worm,10936444,10.1016/s0945-053x(00)00064-0,"Integrins are essential for the development of the two genetically tractable invertebrate model organisms, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Just two integrins are present in C. elegans: one putative RGD binding integrin alphapat-2betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS2betaPS and vertebrate alpha5beta1, alphaVbeta1 and alpha8beta1, and one putative laminin binding integrin alphaina-1betapat-3, corresponding to Drosophila alphaPS1betaPS and vertebrate alpha3beta1, alpha6beta1 and alpha7beta1. In this review, the function of this minimal set of integrins during the development of these two invertebrates is compared. Despite the differences in bodyplan and developmental strategy, integrin adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required for similar processes: the formation of the link that translates muscle contraction into movement of the exoskeleton, cell migration, and morphogenetic interactions between epithelia. Other integrin functions, such as regulation of gene expression, have not yet been experimentally demonstrated in both organisms. Additional proteins have been characterised in each organism that are essential for integrin function, including extracellular matrix ligands and intracellular interacting proteins, but so far different proteins have been found in the two organisms. This in part represents the fact that the characterisation of the full set of interacting proteins is not complete in either system. However, in other cases different proteins appear to be used for similar functions in the two animals. The continued use of genetic approaches to identify proteins required for integrin function in these two model organisms should lead to the identification of the minimal set of conserved components that form integrin adhesive structures.",2000,"N H Brown, N H Brown"
The 3' end CCA of mature tRNA is an antideterminant for eukaryotic 3'-tRNase,10024176,10.1017/s1355838299981256,"Cytoplasmic tRNAs undergo posttranscriptional 5' and 3' end processing in the eukaryotic nucleus, and CCA (which forms the mature 3' end of all tRNAs) must be added by tRNA nucleotidyl transferase before tRNA can be aminoacylated and utilized in translation. Eukaryotic 3'-tRNase can endonucleolytically remove a 3' end trailer by cleaving on the 3' side of the discriminator base (the unpaired nucleotide 3' of the last base pair of the acceptor stem). This reaction proceeds despite a wide range in length and sequence of the 3' end trailer, except that mature tRNA containing the 3' terminal CCA is not a substrate for mouse 3'-tRNase (Nashimoto, 1997, Nucleic Acids Res 25:1148-1154). Herein, we extend this result with Drosophila and pig 3'-tRNase, using Drosophila melanogaster tRNAHis as substrate. Mature tRNA is thus prevented from recycling through 3' end processing. We also tested a series of tRNAs ending at the discriminator base (-), with one C added (+C), two Cs added (+CC), and CCA added (+CCA) as 3'-tRNase inhibitors. Inhibition was competitive with both Drosophila and pig 3'-tRNase. The product of the 3'-tRNase reaction (-) is a good 3'-tRNase inhibitor, with a KI approximately two times KM for the normal 3'-tRNase substrate. KI increases with each nucleotide added beyond the discriminator base, until when tRNA+CCA is used as inhibitor, KI is approximately forty times the substrate KM. The 3'-tRNase can thus remain free to process precursors with 3' end trailers because it is barely inhibited by tRNA+CCA, ensuring that tRNA can progress to aminoacylation. The active site of 3'-tRNase may have evolved to make an especially poor fit with tRNA+CCA.",1999,"A Mohan, S Whyte, X Wang, M Nashimoto, L Levinger, A Mohan, S Whyte, X Wang, M Nashimoto, L Levinger"
The product of the murine homolog of the Drosophila extra sex combs gene displays transcriptional repressor activity,9234727,10.1128/mcb.17.8.4707,"The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K protein represents a novel class of proteins that may act as docking platforms that orchestrate cross-talk among molecules involved in signal transduction and gene expression. Using a fragment of K protein as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated a cDNA that encodes a protein whose primary structure has extensive similarity to the Drosophila melanogaster extra sex combs (esc) gene product, Esc, a putative silencer of homeotic genes. The cDNA that we isolated is identical to the cDNA of the recently positionally cloned mouse embryonic ectoderm development gene, eed. Like Esc, Eed contains six WD-40 repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein and is thought to repress homeotic gene expression during mouse embryogenesis. Eed binds to K protein through a domain in its N terminus, but interestingly, this domain is not found in the Drosophila Esc. Gal4-Eed fusion protein represses transcription of a reporter gene driven by a promoter that contains Gal4-binding DNA elements. Eed also represses transcription when recruited to a target promoter by Gal4-K protein. Point mutations within the eed gene that are responsible for severe embryonic development abnormalities abolished the transcriptional repressor activity of Eed. Results of this study suggest that Eed-restricted homeotic gene expression during embryogenesis reflects the action of Eed as a transcriptional repressor. The Eed-mediated transcriptional effects are likely to reflect the interaction of Eed with multiple molecular partners, including K protein.",1997,"O N Denisenko, K Bomsztyk, O N Denisenko, K Bomsztyk"

We have identified and begun a phenotypic characterization of mutations in the stc gene. stc mutants die at the end of embryogenesis, when they appear to be incapable of coordinating the typical peristaltic contraction waves normally required for embryos to hatch into feeding first instar larvae. Preliminary evidence indicates that the resulting lethality of this behavioral defect is accompanied by subtle morphological abnormalities in the central nervous system, where in wild-type embryos, STC protein is normally localized in the nuclei of repeated cell clusters within each neuromere and brain lobe. Thus, the NF-X1 homolog encoded by the Drosophila stc gene defines a new family of putative transcription factors and plays an essential role in the completion of embryonic development.

Enhancer-trap detection of expression patterns corresponding to the polar coordinate system in the imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster,28305739,10.1007/BF00360483,"We have isolated three classes of ""enhancertrap"" lines of Drosophila in which lacZ expression patterns in the imaginal discs are consistent with the idea of a polar (radial and angular) coordinate system of positional information. In the first class (HZ76), a circular pattern was expressed transiently during the mid-third instar larval stage when the radial components of the coordinate are probably generated. The expression patterns of the second class (HZ84) were sector-shaped and circular in the leg disc, suggesting a correlation with both radial and angular coordinate values. The expression patterns found in the third class (PZ63 and PZ22) were circular and appeared to reflect radial positional values. Expression in the latter two classes always began in the presumptive dorsal region of the leg disc and gradually spread to the ventral region. These developmental profiles of expression suggested the existence of a centre that initiates patterned gene expression in the presumptive dorsal region of the leg disc. The PZ22 line showed transient expression during tarsal segmentation, suggesting its involvement in tarsal segment formation. We have cloned the PZ22 gene and partially determined its sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence contained a zinc finger motif found in DNA/RNA binding proteins. By in situ hybridization, we determined that the PZ22 gene was transcribed in the leg disc in a pattern identical to that of the lacZ expression. In addition, it was expressed transiently in the embryonic mesoderm during mesoderm segmentation. The PZ22 gene, therefore, may function both in mesodermal segmentation in the embryo and in tarsal segmentation in the imaginal disc.",1995,"Satoshi Goto, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoshiki Hotta, Satoshi Goto, Teiichi Tanimura, Yoshiki Hotta"
Enhancer-trap targeting at the Broad-Complex locus of Drosophila melanogaster,7744254,10.1101/gad.9.9.1137,"Here, we describe the exact replacement of a defective unmarked P element by an enhancer-trap transposon marked by the miniwhite gene and carrying lacZ as a reporter gene. The original defective P element was located in an intron of the Broad-Complex (BRC), a key gene involved in metamorphosis. Replacement events resulted from conversions induced by the P-element transposase from a donor enhancer-trap element located on another chromosome. Six independent conversion events were selected. In all converted chromosomes, the enhancer-trap transposon was in the same orientation as the original P element. From the pattern of X-gal staining observed, lacZ expression likely reflects the regulatory influence of BRC enhancers on the convertant transposon. Reversion to wild type was achieved by excision of the enhancer-trap transposon. The six convertants were analyzed in detail at the nucleotide level. The occurrence of a polymorphism at position 33 of the P-element sequences led us to propose a conversion mechanism involving homologous P sequences for repair. This is in contrast to previously analyzed P-element transposase-induced conversion events and proposed models relying on sequence identity between genomic Drosophila sequences. The lack of any homology requirement other than between P element sequences means that our findings can be easily generalized. Targeting a marked P-element derivative at a precise site without loss or addition of genetic information makes it possible to exploit the hundreds of defective P elements scattered throughout the Drosophila genome by replacing them with engineered P elements, already available.",1995,"G Gonzy-Tréboul, J A Lepesant, J Deutsch, G Gonzy-Tréboul, J A Lepesant, J Deutsch"
Distribution of PCNA during postblastoderm cell division cycles in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo: effect of a string- mutation,7796467,10.1247/csf.20.47,"We used immunocytochemical methods and a specific antibody to identify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in Drosophila embryos during the postblastoderm cell division cycles. The strong nuclear staining observed during interphase disappeared at prophase, staining remained nil throughout the remaining mitotic (M) phases and reappeared in nuclei at the next interphase. As the embryos with the homozygous string- mutation sustained the strong staining signal in nuclei throughout embryonic development, disappearance of the staining signal probably depends on string function and is coupled with the onset of mitosis. When cells in embryos were arrested at M phase following treatment with TN-16 or Vinblastine, the staining signal with the anti-PCNA antibody was lost. However, Western blots showed that the level of PCNA protein in M phase-arrested embryos did not decrease. Therefore, the disappearance of staining signals is apparently due to reorganization of PCNA protein in the multiprotein complex in nuclei, rendering it inaccessible to the antibody, rather than to the degradation of PCNA protein. In contrast to findings in developing embryos, cultured Drosophila Kc cells stained strongly with the anti-PCNA antibody, during both interphase and the M phase. In genetic crossing experiments of transgenic flies carrying the lacZ gene under the control of the PCNA gene regulatory region (-607 to +137 with respect to the transcription initiation site) with string- mutant files, the PCNA gene promoter seems to function in a manner independent of cell cycle progression or of functions of the string gene.",1995,"M Yamaguchi, Y Nishimoto, F Hirose, A Matsukage, M Yamaguchi, Y Nishimoto, F Hirose, A Matsukage"

Recent estimates of the number of germ cell divisions per generation are: for humans, 401 (30-year generation) in males and 31 in females; for mice, 62 (9-month generation) in males and 25 in females; and for Drosophila melanogaster, 35.5 (18-day generation) in males and 36.5 (25-day generation) in females. The relationships between germ cell division estimates of the two sexes in the three species closely reflect those between mutation rates in the sexes, although mutation rates per cell division vary among species. Whereas the overall rate per generation is constant among species, this consistency must be achieved by diverse mechanisms. Modifiers of mutation rates, on which selection might act, include germline characteristics that contribute disproportionately to the total mutation rates. The germline mutation rates between the sexes within a species are largely influenced by germ cell divisions per generation. Also, a large portion of the total mutations occur during the interval between the beginning of meiosis and differentiation of the soma from the germline. Significant genetic events contributing to mutations during this time may include meiosis, lack of DNA repair in sperm cells, methylation of CpG dinucleotides in mammalian sperm and early embryo, gonomeric fertilization, and rapid cleavage divisions.",1995,"J B Drost, W R Lee, J B Drost, W R Lee"
Mutations that alter the timing and pattern of cubitus interruptus gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,7705626,,"The cubitus interruptus (ci) gene is a member of the Drosophila segment polarity gene family and encodes a protein with a zinc finger domain homologous to the vertebrate Gli genes and the nematode tra-1 gene. Three classes of existing mutations in the ci locus alter the regulation of ci expression and can be used to examine ci function during development. The first class of ci mutations causes interruptions in wing veins four and five due to inappropriate expression of the ci product in the posterior compartment of imaginal discs. The second class of mutations eliminates ci protein early in embryogenesis and causes the deletion of structures that are derived from the region including and adjacent to the engrailed expressing cells. The third class of mutations eliminates ci protein later in embryogenesis and blocks the formation of the ventral naked cuticle. The loss of ci expression at these two different stages in embryonic development correlates with the subsequent elimination of wingless expression. Adults heterozygous for the unique ciCe mutation have deletions between wing veins three and four. A similar wing defect is present in animals mutant for the segment polarity gene fused that encodes a putative serine/threonine kinase. In ciCe/+ and fused mutants, the deletions between wing veins three and four correlate with increased ci protein levels in the anterior compartment. Thus, proper regulation of both the ci mRNA and protein appears to be critical for normal Drosophila development.",1995,"D C Slusarski, C K Motzny, R Holmgren, D C Slusarski, C K Motzny, R Holmgren"
"High recombinagenic activities of three antiviral agents, adenine derivatives, in the Drosophila wing spot test",7526196,10.1016/0027-5107(94)90189-9,"Three adenine derivatives, (R,S)-9-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)adenine (DHPA), D-eritadenine (EA), and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA), prospective antiviral drugs, were subjected to genotoxicity analysis using the somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster. All three compounds were found to be very potent inducers of mosaic spots on Drosophila wings in a dose-related fashion. Data obtained in inversion-free flies revealed that the compounds, in particular DHPA and EA (nucleoside analogues), are highly effective in the induction of mitotic recombination. PMEA, a nucleotide analogue, exhibited a rather different genotoxic profile from those of DHPA and EA, indicating a different mechanism of genetic action of this compound. Of somatic mutations, chromosome aberrations rather than point mutations seem to play a major role in the genotoxicity of PMEA. In flies carrying an inversion chromosome, which eliminates most products of mitotic recombination, reduced spot frequencies were obtained, which, however, were still unexpectedly high for compounds with strong recombinagenic activities. Most probably, in addition to structural mutations of chromosome, double mitotic crossing-over and non-reciprocal recombination events similar to unequal sister-strand recombination or gene conversion significantly contributed to spot induction in the inversion heterozygous flies. Concerning the mechanism of genotoxic action, we suggest that these adenine derivatives can be incorporated into DNA chains during replication. This would result, via breaks and DNA repair mechanisms, either in various recombination events or in chromosome aberrations.",1994,"F Marec, I Gelbic, F Marec, I Gelbic"
Delays in anaphase initiation occur in individual nuclei of the syncytial Drosophila embryo,8257792,10.1091/mbc.4.9.885,"The syncytial divisions of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo lack some of the well established cell-cycle checkpoints. It has been suggested that without these checkpoints the divisions would display a reduced fidelity. To test this idea, we examined division error frequencies in individuals bearing an abnormally long and rearranged second chromosome, designated C(2)EN. Relative to a normal chromosome, this chromosome imposes additional structural demands on the mitotic apparatus in both the early syncytial embryonic divisions and the later somatic divisions. We demonstrate that the C(2)EN chromosome does not increase the error frequency of the late larva neuroblast divisions. However, in the syncytial embryonic nuclear divisions, the C(2)EN chromosome produces a 10-fold increase in division errors relative to embryos with a normal karyotype. During late anaphase of the neuroblast divisions, the sister C(2)EN chromosomes cleanly separate from one another. In contrast, during late anaphase of the syncytial divisions in C(2)EN-bearing nuclei, large amounts of chromatin often lag on the metaphase plate. Live analysis of C(2)EN-bearing embryos demonstrates that individual nuclei in the syncytial population of dividing nuclei often delay in their initiation of anaphase. These delays frequently lead to division errors. Eventually the products of the nuclei delayed in anaphase sink inward and are removed from the dividing population of syncytial nuclei. These results suggest that the Drosophila embryo may be equipped with mechanisms that monitor the fidelity of the syncytial nuclear divisions. Unlike checkpoints that rely on cell cycle delays to identify and correct division errors, these embryonic mechanisms rely on cell cycle delays to identify and discard the products of division errors.",1993,"W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli, W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli"
Gap junctions in ovarian follicles of Drosophila melanogaster: inhibition and promotion of dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells,8364958,10.1007/BF00304623,"The analysis of chimeras has shown that communication between germ-line and soma cells plays an important role during Drosophila oogenesis. We have therefore investigated the intercellular exchange of the fluorescent tracer molecule, Lucifer yellow, pressure-injected into the oocyte of vitellogenic follicles of Drosophila. The dye reached the nurse cells via cytoplasmic bridges and entered, via gap junctions, the somatic follicle cells covering the oocyte. The percentage of follicles showing dye-coupling between oocyte and follicle cells was found to increase with the developmental stage up to stage 11, but depended also on the status of oogenesis, i.e., the stage-spectrum, in the respective ovary. During late stage 10B and stage 11, dye-coupling was restricted to the follicle cells covering the anterior pole of the oocyte. No dye-coupling was observed from stage 12 onwards. During prolonged incubation in vitro, the dye was found to move from the follicle cells back into the oocyte; this process was suppressable with dinitrophenol. Dye-coupling was inhibited when prolonged in vitro incubation preceded the dye-injection. Moreover, dye-coupling was inhibited with acidic pH, low [K+], high intracellular [Ca2+], octanol, dinitrophenol, and NaN3, but not with retinoic acid, basic pH, or high extracellular [Ca2+]. Dye-coupling was stimulated with a juvenile hormone analogue and with 20-hydroxyecdysone. Thus, gap junctions between oocyte and follicle cells may play an important role in intercellular communication during oogenesis. We discuss the significance of our findings with regard to the electrophysiological properties of the follicles, and to the coordinated activities of the different cell types during follicle development and during the establishment of polarity in the follicle.",1993,"J Bohrmann, A Haas-Assenbaum, J Bohrmann, A Haas-Assenbaum"
Embryonic origin of the imaginal discs of the head of Drosophila melanogaster,28305981,10.1007/BF00539891,"The embryonic development of the primordia of the Drosophila head was studied by using an enhancer trap line expressed in these structures from embryonic stage 13 onward. Particular attention was given to the question of how the adult head primordia relate to the larval head segments. The clypeo-labral bud to the stage 13 embryo is located at a lateral position in the labrum adjacent to the labral sensory complex (""epiphysis""). Both clypeo-labral bud and sensory complex are located anterior to the engrailed-expression domain of the labrum. Throughout late embryogenesis and the larval period, the clypeo-labral bud forms integral part of the epithelium lining the roof of the atrium. The labial disc originates from the lateral labial segment adjacent to the labial sensory complex (""hypophysis""). It partially overlaps with the labial en-domain. After head involution, the labial disc forms a small pocket in the ventro-lateral wall of the atrium. The eye-antenna disc develops from a relatively large territory occupying the dorso-posterior part of the procephalic lobe, as well as parts of the dorsal gnathal segments. Cells in this territory are greatly reduced in number by cell death during stages 12-14. After head involution, the presumptive eye-antenna disc occupies a position in the lateral-posterior part of the dorsal pouch. Evagination of this tissue occurs during the first hours after hatching. In the embryo, no en-expression is present in the presumptive eye-antenna disc. en-expression starts in three separate regions in the third instar larva.",1993,"Amelia Younossi-Hartenstein, Ulrich Tepass, Volker Hartenstein, Amelia Younossi-Hartenstein, Ulrich Tepass, Volker Hartenstein"
Neither enhanced removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers nor strand-specific repair is found after transcription induction of the beta 3-tubulin gene in a Drosophila embryonic cell line Kc,1383806,10.1016/0921-8777(92)90003-l,"Nucleotide excision repair (NER) of ultraviolet (UV) light induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) was assayed in a Drosophila melanogaster Kc subline that responds to treatment with the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-OH-E; beta-ecdysone, ecdysterone). In this cell line the hormone induces transcription of the beta 3-tubulin gene which is not expressed under standard culture conditions. Cells were exposed to either 10 or 15 J/m2 UV (predominantly 254-nm) and removal of CPDs from several genes, including beta 3-tubulin, and total cellular DNA was assayed. We show that upon induction of transcription of the beta 3-tubulin gene, its repair is not enhanced. In non-treated as well as 20-OH-E treated cells, repair kinetics in beta 3-tubulin resemble those in the active genes Gart and Notch, the inactive locus white and total cellular DNA. Moreover, in the presence as well as in the absence of transcription, the separate strands of the beta 3-tubulin gene are repaired with the same rate and to the same extent: about 90% after 24 h. It can be concluded from these observations that transcription is not a prerequisite for the efficient repair of CPDs in the Drosophila embryonic Kc cell line.",1992,"J G de Cock, E C Klink, W Ferro, P H Lohman, J C Eeken, J G de Cock, E C Klink, W Ferro, P H Lohman, J C Eeken"
"There are two mechanisms of achiasmate segregation in Drosophila females, one of which requires heterochromatic homology",1304424,10.1002/dvg.1020130608,"There are numerous examples of the regular segregation of achiasmate chromosomes at meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster females. Classically, the choice of achiasmate segregational partners has been thought to be independent of homology, but rather made on the basis of availability or similarities in size and shape. To the contrary, we show here that heterochromatic homology plays a primary role in ensuring the proper segregation of achiasmate homologs. We observe that the heterochromatin of chromosome 4 functions as, or contains, a meiotic pairing site. We show that free duplications carrying the 4th chromosome pericentric heterochromatin induce high frequencies of 4th chromosome nondisjunction regardless of their size. Moreover, a duplication from which some of the 4th chromosome heterochromatin has been removed is unable to induce 4th chromosome nondisjunction. Similarly, in the absence of either euchromatic homology or a size similarity, duplications bearing the X chromosome heterochromatin also disrupt the segregation of two achiasmate X chromosome centromeres. Although heterochromatic regions are sufficient to conjoin nonexchange homologues, we confirm that the segregation of heterologous chromosomes is determined by size, shape, and availability. The meiotic mutation Axs differentiates between these two processes of achiasmate centromere coorientation by disrupting only the homology-dependent mechanism. Thus there are two different mechanisms by which achiasmate segregational partners are chosen. We propose that the absence of diplotene-diakinesis during female meiosis allows heterochromatic pairings to persist until prometaphase and thus to co-orient homologous centromeres. We also propose that heterologous disjunctions result from a separate and homology-independent process that likely occurs during prometaphase. The latter process, which may not require the physical association of segregational partners, is similar to those observed in many insects, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in C. elegans males. We also suggest that the physical basis of this process may reflect known properties of the Drosophila meiotic spindle.",1992,"R S Hawley, H Irick, A E Zitron, D A Haddox, A Lohe, C New, M D Whitley, T Arbel, J Jang, K McKim, R S Hawley, H Irick, A E Zitron, D A Haddox, A Lohe, C New, M D Whitley, T Arbel, J Jang, K McKim"
The gene fl(2)d is required for various Sxl-controlled processes in Drosophila females,28306022,10.1007/BF00190237,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the gene Sex-lethal (Sxl) controls the processes of sex determination, dosage compensation, oogenesis and sexual behaviour. The control of Sxl is by alternative splicing of its primary RNA. We have identified a gene, female-lethal-2-d (fl(2)d), which is needed for the female-specific splicing of Sxl RNA and which also has a vital function independent of Sxl. Here we analyse other aspects of the gene fl(2)d. Specifically, we have analysed the effect of the temperature-sensitive mutation fl(2)d 1 on the viability of adult flies homozygous for this mutation. We have found that the viability of the mutant females is reduced, while that of the mutant males is not affected. In addition, the capacity of the mutant females to be inseminated is considerably reduced, whilst all the mutant males are able to inseminate females. These effects on females are suppressed by Sxl M1. However, the fat body cells of fl(2)d 1 homozygous females are able to synthesize yolk proteins at the restrictive temperature. We have also carried out, in males, a clonal analysis of fl(2)d 2, a mutation lethal in both sexes. We have found that the clones are fully viable. We conclude that the gene fl(2)d seems to be necessary during the adult life of females for the processes that require Sxl + activity. Moreover, the Sxl-independent vital function of fl(2)d seems to be required in both sexes only during larval development.",1991,"Begoña Granadino, Ana B San Juán, Lucas Sánchez, Begoña Granadino, Ana B San Juán, Lucas Sánchez"
Distribution of MR-induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila melanogaster,3923338,10.1016/0027-5107(85)90122-8,"In the 'doubling-dose' method currently used in genetic risk evaluation, two principle assumptions are made and these are: (1) there is proportionality between spontaneous and induced mutations and (2) the lesions that lead to spontaneous and induced mutations are essentially similar. The studies reported in this paper were directed at examining the validity of these two assumptions in Drosophila. An analysis was made of the distribution of sex-linked recessive lethals induced by MR, one of the well-studied mutator systems in Drosophila. Appropriate genetic complementation tests with 15 defined X-chromosome duplications showed that MR-induced lethals occurred at many sites along the X-chromosome (in contrast to the known locus specificity of MR-induced visible-mutations); some, but not all these sites at which recessive lethals arose in the MR-system are the same as those known to be hot-spots for X-ray-induced lethals. With in situ hybridization we were able to demonstrate that a majority of MR-induced lethals is associated with a particular mobile DNA sequence, the P-element, i.e. they arose as a result of transposition. The differences between the profiles of MR-induced and X-ray-induced recessive lethals, and the nature of MR-induced and X-ray-induced mutations, thus raise questions about the validity of the assumptions involved in the use of the 'doubling-dose' method.",1985,"J C Eeken, F H Sobels, V Hyland, A P Schalet, J C Eeken, F H Sobels, V Hyland, A P Schalet"
Chromosome structure and DNA replication in nurse and follicle cells of Drosophila melanogaster,3920017,10.1007/BF00328222,"In the nurse cells of Drosophila, nuclear DNA is replicated many times without nuclear division. Nurse cells differ from salivary gland cells, another type of endoreplicated Drosophila cell, in that banded polytene chromosomes are not seen in large nurse cells. Cytophotometry of Feulgen stained nurse cell nuclei that have also been labeled with 3H-thymidine shows that the DNA contents between S-phases are not doublings of the diploid value. In situ hybridization of cloned probes for 28S + 18S ribosomal RNA, 5S RNA, and histone genes, and for satellite, copia, and telomere sequences shows that satellite and histone sequences replicate only partially during nurse cell growth, while 5S sequences fully replicate. However, during the last nurse cell endoreplication cycle, all sequences including the previously under-replicated satellite sequences replicate fully. In situ hybridization experiments also demonstrate that the loci for the multiple copies of histone and 5S RNA genes are clustered into a small number of sites. In contrast, 28S + 18S rRNA genes are dispersed. We discuss the implications of the observed distribution of sequences within nurse cell nuclei for interphase nuclear organization. In the ovarian follicle cells, which undergo only two or three endoreplication cycles, satellite, histone and ribosomal DNA sequences are also found by in situ hybridization to be underrepresented; satellite sequences may not replicate beyond their level in 2C cells. Hence the pathways of endoreplication in three cell types, salivary gland, nurse, and follicle cells, share basic features of DNA replication, and differ primarily in the extent of association of the duplicated chromatids.",1985,"M P Hammond, C D Laird, M P Hammond, C D Laird"

The mosquito Aedes aegypti has a large genome size and high transposable element load but contains a low proportion of transposon-specific piRNAs,22171608,10.1186/1471-2164-12-606,"Background:
      
    

    
      The piRNA pathway has been shown in model organisms to be involved in silencing of transposons thereby providing genome stability. In D. melanogaster the majority of piRNAs map to these sequences. The medically important mosquito species Aedes aegypti has a large genome size, a high transposon load which includes Miniature Inverted repeat Transposable Elements (MITES) and an expansion of the piRNA biogenesis genes. Studies of transgenic lines of Ae. aegypti have indicated that introduced transposons are poorly remobilized and we sought to explore the basis of this. We wished to analyze the piRNA profile of Ae. aegypti and thereby determine if it is responsible for transposon silencing in this mosquito.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Estimated piRNA sequence diversity was comparable between Ae. aegypti and D. melanogaster, but surprisingly only 19% of mosquito piRNAs mapped to transposons compared to 51% for D. melanogaster. Ae. aegypti piRNA clusters made up a larger percentage of the total genome than those of D. melanogaster but did not contain significantly higher percentages of transposon derived sequences than other regions of the genome. Ae. aegypti contains a number of protein coding genes that may be sources of piRNA biogenesis with two, traffic jam and maelstrom, implicated in this process in model organisms. Several genes of viral origin were also targeted by piRNAs. Examination of six mosquito libraries that had previously been transformed with transposon derived sequence revealed that new piRNA sequences had been generated to the transformed sequences, suggesting that they may have stimulated a transposon inactivation mechanism.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Ae. aegypti has a large piRNA complement that maps to transposons but primarily gene sequences, including many viral-derived sequences.

The Wolbachia cytoplasmic incompatibility enzyme CidB targets nuclear import and protamine-histone exchange factors,31774393,10.7554/eLife.50026,"Intracellular Wolbachia bacteria manipulate arthropod reproduction to promote their own inheritance. The most prevalent mechanism, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), traces to a Wolbachia deubiquitylase, CidB, and CidA. CidB has properties of a toxin, while CidA binds CidB and rescues embryonic viability. CidB is also toxic to yeast where we identified both host effects and high-copy suppressors of toxicity. The strongest suppressor was karyopherin-α, a nuclear-import receptor; this required nuclear localization-signal binding. A protein-interaction screen of Drosophila extracts using a substrate-trapping catalytic mutant, CidB*, also identified karyopherin-α; the P32 protamine-histone exchange factor bound as well. When CidB* bound CidA, these host protein interactions disappeared. These associations would place CidB at the zygotic male pronucleus where CI defects first manifest. Overexpression of karyopherin-α, P32, or CidA in female flies suppressed CI. We propose that CidB targets nuclear-protein import and protamine-histone exchange and that CidA rescues embryos by restricting CidB access to its targets.",2019,"John Frederick Beckmann, Gagan Deep Sharma, Luis Mendez, Hongli Chen, Mark Hochstrasser, John Frederick Beckmann, Gagan Deep Sharma, Luis Mendez, Hongli Chen, Mark Hochstrasser"
Front-end Weber-Fechner gain control enhances the fidelity of combinatorial odor coding,31251174,10.7554/eLife.45293,"We showed previously (Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017) that Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the co-receptor Orco scale their gain inversely with mean odor intensity according to Weber-Fechner's law. Here, we show that this front-end adaptation promotes the reconstruction of odor identity from dynamic odor signals, even in the presence of confounding background odors and rapid intensity fluctuations. These enhancements are further aided by known downstream transformations in the antennal lobe and mushroom body. Our results, which are applicable to various odor classification and reconstruction schemes, stem from the fact that this adaptation mechanism is not intrinsic to the identity of the receptor involved. Instead, a feedback mechanism adjusts receptor sensitivity based on the activity of the receptor-Orco complex, according to Weber-Fechner's law. Thus, a common scaling of the gain across Orco-expressing ORNs may be a key feature of ORN adaptation that helps preserve combinatorial odor codes in naturalistic landscapes.",2019,"Nirag Kadakia, Thierry Emonet, Nirag Kadakia, Thierry Emonet"

Here we show that DIP-α is expressed by two identified motor neurons, while its binding partner Dpr10 is expressed by postsynaptic muscle targets. Removal of either DIP-α or Dpr10 results in loss of specific axonal branches and NMJs formed by one motor neuron, MNISN-1s, while other branches of the MNISN-1s axon develop normally.

Neuronal cell fate diversification controlled by sub-temporal action of Kruppel,27740908,10.7554/eLife.19311,"During Drosophila embryonic nervous system development, neuroblasts express a programmed cascade of five temporal transcription factors that govern the identity of cells generated at different time-points.

The sub-temporal program acts both upon itself and upon the determination cascades to diversify the castor window. Surprisingly, the early temporal gene Kruppel acts as one of the sub-temporal genes within the late castor window. Intriguingly, while the temporal gene castor activates the two determination cascades and the sub-temporal program, spatial cues controlling cell fate in the latter part of the 5-6 lineage exclusively act upon the determination cascades.",2016,"Johannes Stratmann, Hugo Gabilondo, Jonathan Benito-Sipos, Stefan Thor, Johannes Stratmann, Hugo Gabilondo, Jonathan Benito-Sipos, Stefan Thor"

Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression.

Nutrient restriction enhances the proliferative potential of cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN in mitotic tissues,23853709,10.7554/eLife.00380,"How single cells in a mitotic tissue progressively acquire hallmarks of cancer is poorly understood. We exploited mitotic recombination in developing Drosophila imaginal tissues to analyze the behavior of cells devoid of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling, under varying nutritional conditions. Cells lacking PTEN strongly overproliferated specifically in nutrient restricted larvae. Although the PTEN mutant cells were sensitive to starvation, they successfully competed with neighboring cells by autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms distinct from cell competition. The overgrowth was strictly dependent on the activity of the downstream components Akt/PKB and TORC1, and a reduction in amino acid uptake by reducing the levels of the amino acid transporter Slimfast caused clones of PTEN mutant cells to collapse.

Cellular specificity of expression and regulation of Drosophila vitelline membrane protein 32E gene in the follicular epithelium: identification of cis-acting elements,1768620,10.1016/0925-4773(91)90018-2,"In this paper we analyze the expression in follicular cells and regulation of the vitelline membrane protein gene we identified in region 32E of the second chromosome of D. melanogaster (VMP32E). We report germ line transformation results obtained with different kinds of gene fusion leading to the identification of a follicular cell subpopulation involved in the expression of the VMP32E. We have characterized two 5' non-transcribed regions (-465/-249; -135/-39) where the cis-acting transcriptional regulatory sequences, directing tissue and temporal specificity, are contained. The region between -465 and -249, which appears to control transcriptional high efficiency, does not behave as an enhancer as it is incapable of conferring any expression to a reporter gene. The region between -135 and -39 can confer temporal specificity of expression of the VMP32E gene, albeit at a very low level. Most interestingly, sequence similarities to ecdysone response elements raise the possibility of hormonal control also for VMP gene expression.",1991,"G Gargiulo, S Gigliotti, C Malva, F Graziani, G Gargiulo, S Gigliotti, C Malva, F Graziani"
Wolbachia Acquisition by Drosophila yakuba-Clade Hosts and Transfer of Incompatibility Loci Between Distantly Related Wolbachia,31227544,10.1534/genetics.119.302349,"Maternally transmitted Wolbachia infect about half of insect species, yet the predominant mode(s) of Wolbachia acquisition remains uncertain. Species-specific associations could be old, with Wolbachia and hosts codiversifying (i.e., cladogenic acquisition), or relatively young and acquired by horizontal transfer or introgression. The three Drosophila yakuba-clade hosts [(D. santomea, D. yakuba) D. teissieri] diverged ∼3 MYA and currently hybridize on the West African islands Bioko and São Tomé. Each species is polymorphic for nearly identical Wolbachia that cause weak cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI)-reduced egg hatch when uninfected females mate with infected males. D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia are closely related to wMel, globally polymorphic in D. melanogaster We use draft Wolbachia and mitochondrial genomes to demonstrate that D. yakuba-clade phylogenies for Wolbachia and mitochondria tend to follow host nuclear phylogenies. However, roughly half of D. santomea individuals, sampled both inside and outside of the São Tomé hybrid zone, have introgressed D. yakuba mitochondria. Both mitochondria and Wolbachia possess far more recent common ancestors than the bulk of the host nuclear genomes, precluding cladogenic Wolbachia acquisition. General concordance of Wolbachia and mitochondrial phylogenies suggests that horizontal transmission is rare, but varying relative rates of molecular divergence complicate chronogram-based statistical tests. Loci that cause CI in wMel are disrupted in D. yakuba-clade Wolbachia; but a second set of loci predicted to cause CI are located in the same WO prophage region. These alternative CI loci seem to have been acquired horizontally from distantly related Wolbachia, with transfer mediated by flanking Wolbachia-specific ISWpi1 transposons.",2019,"Brandon S Cooper, Dan Vanderpool, William R Conner, Daniel R Matute, Michael Turelli, Brandon S Cooper, Dan Vanderpool, William R Conner, Daniel R Matute, Michael Turelli"
Potential Direct Regulators of the Drosophila yellow Gene Identified by Yeast One-Hybrid and RNAi Screens,27527791,10.1534/g3.116.032607,"The regulation of gene expression controls development, and changes in this regulation often contribute to phenotypic evolution. Drosophila pigmentation is a model system for studying evolutionary changes in gene regulation, with differences in expression of pigmentation genes such as yellow that correlate with divergent pigment patterns among species shown to be caused by changes in cis- and trans-regulation. Currently, much more is known about the cis-regulatory component of divergent yellow expression than the trans-regulatory component, in part because very few trans-acting regulators of yellow expression have been identified. This study aims to improve our understanding of the trans-acting control of yellow expression by combining yeast-one-hybrid and RNAi screens for transcription factors binding to yellow cis-regulatory sequences and affecting abdominal pigmentation in adults, respectively. Of the 670 transcription factors included in the yeast-one-hybrid screen, 45 showed evidence of binding to one or more sequence fragments tested from the 5' intergenic and intronic yellow sequences from D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. willistoni, suggesting that they might be direct regulators of yellow expression. Of the 670 transcription factors included in the yeast-one-hybrid screen, plus another TF previously shown to be genetically upstream of yellow, 125 were also tested using RNAi, and 32 showed altered abdominal pigmentation. Nine transcription factors were identified in both screens, including four nuclear receptors related to ecdysone signaling (Hr78, Hr38, Hr46, and Eip78C). This finding suggests that yellow expression might be directly controlled by nuclear receptors influenced by ecdysone during early pupal development when adult pigmentation is forming.",2016,"Gizem Kalay, Richard Lusk, Mackenzie Dome, Korneel Hens, Bart Deplancke, Patricia J Wittkopp, Gizem Kalay, Richard Lusk, Mackenzie Dome, Korneel Hens, Bart Deplancke, Patricia J Wittkopp"
Herbal supplement extends life span under some environmental conditions and boosts stress resistance,25879540,10.1371/journal.pone.0119068,"Genetic studies indicate that aging is modulated by a great number of genetic pathways. We have used Drosophila longevity and stress assays to test a multipath intervention strategy. To carry out this strategy, we supplemented the flies with herbal extracts (SC100) that are predicted to modulate the expression of many genes involved in aging and stress resistance, such as mTOR, NOS, NF-KappaB, and VEGF. When flies were housed in large cages with SC100 added, daily mortality rates of both male and female flies were greatly diminished in mid to late life. Surprisingly, SC100 also stabilized midlife mortality rate increases so as to extend the maximum life span substantially beyond the limits previously reported for D. melanogaster. Under these conditions, SC100 also promoted robust resistance to partial starvation stress and to heat stress. Fertility was the same initially in both treated and control flies, but it became significantly higher in treated flies at older ages as the fertility of control flies declined. Mean and maximum life spans of flies in vials at the same test site were also extended by SC100, but the life spans were short in absolute terms. In contrast, at an independent test site where stress was minimized, the flies exhibited much longer mean life spans, but the survival curves became highly rectangular and the effects of SC100 on both mean and maximum life spans declined greatly or were abolished. The data indicate that SC100 is a novel herbal mix with striking effects on enhancing Drosophila stress resistance and life span in some environments, while minimizing mid to late life mortality rates. They also show that the environment and other factors can have transformative effects on both the length and distribution of survivorship, and on the ability of SC100 to extend the life span.",2015,"Bryant Villeponteau, Kennedy Matsagas, Amber C Nobles, Cristina Rizza, Marc Horwitz, Gregory Benford, Robin J Mockett, Bryant Villeponteau, Kennedy Matsagas, Amber C Nobles, Cristina Rizza, Marc Horwitz, Gregory Benford, Robin J Mockett"
Genetic changes accompanying the evolution of host specialization in Drosophila sechellia,19033155,10.1534/genetics.108.093419,"Changes in host specialization contribute to the diversification of phytophagous insects. When shifting to a new host, insects evolve new physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations. Our understanding of the genetic changes responsible for these adaptations is limited. For instance, we do not know how often host shifts involve gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function alleles. Recent work suggests that some genes involved in odor recognition are lost in specialists. Here we show that genes involved in detoxification and metabolism, as well as those affecting olfaction, have reduced gene expression in Drosophila sechellia-a specialist on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia. We screened for genes that differ in expression between D. sechellia and its generalist sister species, D. simulans. We also screened for genes that are differentially expressed in D. sechellia when these flies chose their preferred host vs. when they were forced onto other food. D. sechellia increases expression of genes involved with oogenesis and fatty acid metabolism when on its host. The majority of differentially expressed genes, however, appear downregulated in D. sechellia. For several functionally related genes, this decrease in expression is associated with apparent loss-of-function alleles. For example, the D. sechellia allele of Odorant binding protein 56e (Obp56e) harbors a premature stop codon. We show that knockdown of Obp56e activity significantly reduces the avoidance response of D. melanogaster toward M. citrifolia. We argue that apparent loss-of-function alleles like Obp56e potentially contributed to the initial adaptation of D. sechellia to its host. Our results suggest that a subset of genes reduce or lose function as a consequence of host specialization, which may explain why, in general, specialist insects tend to shift to chemically similar hosts.",2009,"Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones, Ian Dworkin, Corbin D Jones"
Retrotransposon-induced overexpression of a homeobox gene causes defects in eye morphogenesis in Drosophila,1671353,,"Insertion of the tom transposable element into various Drosophila ananassae genes results in dominant phenotypes that affect eye morphology. One of these genes encoded by the Om(1D) locus was isolated by transposon tagging. The Om(1D) gene encodes a 2.7 kb transcript that is expressed in every stage of development. The deduced Om(1D) protein is 606 amino acids long and contains two glutamine/histidine, two alanine-rich and one histidine/proline repeats, as well as a homeodomain located near the carboxy terminus. Tom-induced alleles of Om(1D) show a 1.7-fold increased accumulation of Om(1D) RNA in whole individuals during late larval--early pupal stages of development, whereas expression of this transcript is 7-fold higher in the eye--antenna imaginal disc of mutant versus wild-type flies. D. melanogaster flies transformed with the Om(1D) coding region under the control of the hsp70 promoter display an eye phenotype similar to that of Om(1D) when expression of the homeobox protein encoded by the chimeric gene is induced by temperature elevation at the end of the third instar period. These results suggest that the eye-specific mutant phenotype caused by the insertion of the tom retrotransposon in the Om(1D) locus may be a consequence of the tissue-specific induction of the expression of this gene by sequences present in the transposable element.",1991,"S Tanda, V G Corces, S Tanda, V G Corces"
Genetic basis of octanoic acid resistance in Drosophila sechellia: functional analysis of a fine-mapped region,28035709,10.1111/mec.14001,"Drosophila sechellia is a species of fruit fly endemic to the Seychelles islands. Unlike its generalist sister species, D. sechellia has evolved to be a specialist on the host plant Morinda citrifolia. This specialization is interesting because the plant's fruit contains secondary defence compounds, primarily octanoic acid (OA), that are lethal to most other Drosophilids. Although ecological and behavioural adaptations to this toxic fruit are known, the genetic basis for evolutionary changes in OA resistance is not. Prior work showed that a genomic region on chromosome 3R containing 18 genes has the greatest contribution to differences in OA resistance between D. sechellia and D. simulans. To determine which gene(s) in this region might be involved in the evolutionary change in OA resistance, we knocked down expression of each gene in this region in D. melanogaster with RNA interference (RNAi) (i) ubiquitously throughout development, (ii) during only the adult stage and (iii) within specific tissues. We identified three neighbouring genes in the Osiris family, Osiris 6 (Osi6), Osi7 and Osi8, that led to decreased OA resistance when ubiquitously knocked down. Tissue-specific RNAi, however, showed that decreasing expression of Osi6 and Osi7 specifically in the fat body and/or salivary glands increased OA resistance. Gene expression analyses of Osi6 and Osi7 revealed that while standing levels of expression are higher in D. sechellia, Osi6 expression is significantly downregulated in salivary glands in response to OA exposure, suggesting that evolved tissue-specific environmental plasticity of Osi6 expression may be responsible for OA resistance in D. sechellia.",2017,"J M Andrade López, S M Lanno, J M Auerbach, E C Moskowitz, L A Sligar, P J Wittkopp, J D Coolon, J M Andrade López, S M Lanno, J M Auerbach, E C Moskowitz, L A Sligar, P J Wittkopp, J D Coolon"

Although these patterns suggest selection, there is generally no attempt to test how large differences at the geographical level are relative to levels of variation within and between local populations. Here we compare these levels in D. melanogaster from temperate Tasmania versus tropical northern Queensland by focusing on adult resistance to desiccation, cold and starvation stress, as well as associated traits (size, lipid content). For starvation and desiccation resistance, levels of variation were highest among strains from the same population. whereas there was little differentiation among local populations and a low level of differentiation at the geographic level. For adult cold resistance, there was local differentiation and strain variation but no geographic variation. For size (thorax length), geographic differentiation was higher despite some overlap among strains from the tropical and temperate locations. Finally, for lipid levels there was only evidence for variation among strains. The low level of differentiation among geographic locations for stress resistance was further verified with the characterization of isofemale strains from 18 locations along a coastal transect extending from Tasmania to northern Queensland. Crosses among some of the isofemale strains showed that results were not confounded by inbreeding effects. Strains derived from a cross between a tropical and temperate strain differed for all traits, and variation among strains for body size was higher than strain variation within the geographic regions. Unlike in previous studies, lipid content and starvation resistance were not correlated in any set of strains, but there was a correlation between cold resistance and lipid content. There was also a correlation between desiccation resistance and size but only in the geographic cross strains. These findings suggest a large amount of variation in stress resistance at the population level and inconsistent correlation patterns across experimental approaches.",2001,"A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, P Mitrovski, A A Hoffmann, R Hallas, C Sinclair, P Mitrovski"
The yan gene is highly conserved in Drosophila and its expression suggests a complex role throughout development,10079364,10.1007/s004270050245,"Competence for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation is under tight control of regulatory genes. Yan, a nuclear target of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, is an E twenty six (ETS) DNA-binding protein that functions as a negative regulator of cell differentiation and proliferation in Drosophila. Most members of RTK signaling pathways are highly conserved through evolution, yet no yan orthologues have been identified to date in vertebrates. To investigate the degree of yan conservation during evolution, we have characterized a yan homologue from a sibling species of D. melanogaster, D. virilis. Our results show that the organization, primary structure and expression pattern of yan are highly conserved. Both genes span over 20 kb and contain four exons with introns at identical positions. The areas with highest amino acid similarity include the Pointed and ETS domain but there are other discrete regions with a high degree of similarity. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that yan's closest relative is the human tel gene, a negative regulator of differentiation in hematopoetic precursors. In both species, Yan is dynamically expressed beginning as early as stage 4/5 and persisting throughout embryogenesis. In third instar larvae, Yan is expressed in and behind the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc as well as in the laminar precursor cells of the brain. Ovarian follicle cells also contain Yan protein. Conservation of the structure and expression patterns of yan genes strongly suggests that regulatory mechanisms for their expression are also conserved in these two species.",1999,"M D Price, Z Lai, M D Price, Z Lai"
Evolution of the transposable element Uhu in five species of Hawaiian Drosophila,1334909,10.1007/BF00133708,"The complete DNA sequence of three independent isolates of Uhu, a member of the Tc1-like class of transposable elements from D. heteroneura (Uhu-1, Uhu-3, and Uhu-4), has been determined. These isolates have between 95 and 96.4% nucleotide sequence identity indicating that Uhu is well conserved within this species. A comparison of the DNA sequences of Uhu and the D. melanogaster Hb1 transposable element shows that the nucleotide substitution rate for Uhu is comparable to the synonymous rate for the Adh gene in these species. Uhu has been identified in four other species of endemic Hawaiian Drosophila, D. silvestris, D. differens, D. planitibia and D. picticornis, and nine Uhu elements were isolated from genomic libraries of these four species. A 444 base pair region from within the coding region of the Uhu element, with well conserved ends, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used for sequence comparison of elements from different species. The analysis of the sequence similarities between the elements within and between the species shows a grouping of the two pairs of most closely related species (D. heteroneura and D. silvestris, and D. differens and D. planitibia), but shows a much larger variation within the most recently diverged species (D. heteroneura and D. silvestris) than expected. There are extensive nucleotide substitutions and deletions in the Uhu elements from D. picticornis showing that they are degenerating and being lost in this species. These observations indicate that the Uhu element has been transmitted vertically and that transposition may have been activated at the time of formation of each species as it colonized the newly formed islands of the Hawaiian archipelago.",1992,"L Brezinsky, T D Humphreys, J A Hunt, L Brezinsky, T D Humphreys, J A Hunt"
Fluorescence patterns of heterochromatin in mitotic and polytene chromosomes in seven members of three sub-groups of the melanogaster species group of Drosophila,6777123,10.1007/BF00292428,"A comparative study of fluorescence patterns of heterochromatin in mitotic and polytene chromosomes of seven species belonging to 3 subgroups (melanogaster sub-group: D. melanogaster and D. simulans; montium sub-group: D. kikkawai and D. jambulina; ananassae sub-group: D. ananassae. D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata) of the melanogaster species group of Drosophila (Sophophora) has been made. Hoechst 33258 (H) fluorescence patterns of mitotic chromosomes reveal differences correlated to the taxonomic groupings of these species. The melanogaster sub-group species have H-bright regions on heterochromatin of all chromosomes; the montium subgroup species have H-bright regions mainly on the 4th and Y-chromosomes; in the ananassae sub-group, while D. ananassae chromosomes do not show any H-bright regions. D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata have small H-bright segments only on their 4th chromosomes. The H- and quinacrine mustard (QM) fluorescence patterns of larval salivary gland polytene chromocentre in these species, however, do not show the same taxonomic correlation. While D. ananassae and D. kikkawai polytene nuclei lack any H- or QM-bright region in the chromocentre, the remaining species have prominent H- and/or QM-bright region(s). In D. jambulina, the QM-bright regions are generally bigger than H-bright regions, while in D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata the situation is reversed. Actinomycin D counterstaining prior to H-staining of polytene preparations of each species confirms that the H-bright region/s in the chromocentre are composed of A-T rich sequences. In vivo labelling of salivary gland polytene nuclei with 5-bromo-deoxyuridine for 24 to 48 h and subsequent H-staining reveals that in all the species, the H-bright regions do not replicate in 3rd instar stage and presumably represent the non-replicating alpha heterochromatin. Significantly, in all the species (excepting D. kikkawai and D. ananassae), the size, location and the number of H- and/or QM-bright regions were seen to vary in different polytene nuclei in the same gland. It seems that the organization and the extent of under-replication of alpha heterochromatin varies in different polytene nuclei. Present studies also show that even closely related species differ in the content and organization of H-bright heterochromatin. The 81F band at the base of 3R in D. melanogaster, but not in D. simulans, appears to contain non-replicating H-bright sequences in addition to replicating chromatin.",1980,"S C Lakhotia, A Mishra, S C Lakhotia, A Mishra"
Small eyes in dim light: Implications to spatio-temporal visual abilities in Drosophila melanogaster,32163744,10.1016/j.visres.2020.02.007,"Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, are active over a range of light intensities in the wild, but lab-reared flies are often tested only in bright light. Similarly, scarce feeding during larval stages-common in nature-generates smaller adults, and a wide range of eye sizes not found in well-fed lab colonies. Both dimmer light and smaller eyes limit light capture and have undetermined effects on visual behaviors such as flight. In this study, we used moving sinusoidal gratings to test spatial acuity, temporal acuity, and contrast threshold of female flies of varying eye sizes at different light intensities. We also investigated vision in the smaller and often neglected male fruit flies. As light intensity drops from 50.1 lx to 0.3 lx, flies have a reduced spatial acuity (females: from 0.1 to 0.06 cycles per degree, CPD, males: 0.1 to 0.04 CPD) and temporal acuity (females: from 50 Hz to 10 Hz, males: 25 Hz to 10 Hz), and an increased contrast detection threshold (females: from 10% to 29%, males: 19% to 48%). We find no major sex-specific differences after accounting for eye size. Visual abilities in both small (eye area of 0.1-0.17 mm2) and large flies (0.17-0.23 mm2) suffer at 0.3 lx compared to 50.1 lx, but small flies suffer more (spatial acuity: 0.03 vs 0.06 CPD, contrast threshold: 76% vs 57%, temporal acuity: 5 Hz vs 10 Hz). Our results suggest visual abilities of small flies suffer more than large flies at low light levels, possibly leading to size- and light intensity-dependent effects on foraging, navigation, and flight.",2020,"Ravindra Palavalli-Nettimi, Jamie C Theobald, Ravindra Palavalli-Nettimi, Jamie C Theobald"
Effects of developmental plasticity on heat tolerance may be mediated by changes in cell size in Drosophila melanogaster,31829515,10.1111/1744-7917.12742,"There is a growing interest in the physiology underpinning heat tolerance of ectotherms and their responses to the ongoing rise in temperature. However, there is no consensus about the underlying physiological mechanisms. According to ""the maintain aerobic scope and regulate oxygen supply"" hypothesis, responses to warming at different organizational levels contribute to the ability to safeguard energy metabolism via aerobic pathways. At the cellular level, a decrease in cell size increases the capacity for the uptake of resources (e.g., food and oxygen), but the maintenance of electrochemical gradients across cellular membranes implies greater energetic costs in small cells. In this study, we investigated how different rearing temperatures affected cell size and heat tolerance in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We tested the hypothesis that smaller-celled flies are more tolerant to acute, intense heat stress whereas larger-celled flies are more tolerant to chronic, mild heat stress. We used the thermal tolerance landscape framework, which incorporates the intensity and duration of thermal challenge. Rearing temperatures strongly affected both cell size and survival times. We found different effects of developmental plasticity on tolerance to either chronic or acute heat stress. Warm-reared flies had both smaller cells and exhibited higher survival times under acute, intense heat stress when compared to cold-reared flies. However, under chronic, mild heat stress, the situation was reversed and cold-reared flies, consisting of larger cells, showed better survival. These differences in heat tolerance could have resulted from direct effects of rearing temperature or they may be mediated by the correlated changes in cell size. Notably, our results are consistent with the idea that a smaller cell size may confer tolerance to acute temperatures via enhanced oxygen supply, while a larger cell may confer greater tolerance to chronic and less intense heat stress via more efficient use of resources.",2019,"Nadja Verspagen, Félix P Leiva, Irene M Janssen, Wilco C E P Verberk, Nadja Verspagen, Félix P Leiva, Irene M Janssen, Wilco C E P Verberk"
Mutational analysis of cysteine residues of the insect odorant co-receptor (Orco) from Drosophila melanogaster reveals differential effects on agonist- and odorant-tuning receptor-dependent activation,25271160,10.1074/jbc.M114.603993,"Insect odorant receptors are heteromeric odorant-gated cation channels comprising a conventional odorant-sensitive tuning receptor (ORx) and a highly conserved co-receptor known as Orco. Orco is found only in insects, and very little is known about its structure and the mechanism leading to channel activation. In the absence of an ORx, Orco forms homomeric channels that can be activated by a synthetic agonist, VUAA1. Drosophila melanogaster Orco (DmelOrco) contains eight cysteine amino acid residues, six of which are highly conserved. In this study, we replaced individual cysteine residues with serine or alanine and expressed Orco mutants in Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells. Changes in intracellular Ca(2+) levels were used to determine responses to VUAA1. Replacement of two cysteines (Cys-429 and Cys-449) in a predicted intracellular loop (ICL3), individually or together, gave variants that all showed similar increases in the rate of response and sensitivity to VUAA1 compared with wild-type DmelOrco. Kinetic modeling indicated that the response of the Orco mutants to VUAA1 was faster than wild-type Orco. The enhanced sensitivity and faster response of the Cys mutants was confirmed by whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology. In contrast to the results from direct agonist activation of Orco, the two cysteine replacement mutants when co-expressed with a tuning receptor (DmelOR22a) showed an ∼10-fold decrease in potency for activation by 2-methyl hexanoate. Our work has shown that intracellular loop 3 is important for Orco channel activation.

Hemiclonal analysis of interacting phenotypes in male and female Drosophila melanogaster,24884361,10.1186/1471-2148-14-95,"Background:
      
    

    
      Identifying the sources of variation in mating interactions between males and females is important because this variation influences the strength and/or the direction of sexual selection that populations experience. While the origins and effects of variation in male attractiveness and ornamentation have received much scrutiny, the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in females have been relatively overlooked. We used cytogenetic cloning techniques developed for Drosophila melanogaster to create ""hemiclonal"" males and females with whom we directly observed sexual interaction between individuals of different known genetic backgrounds and measured subsequent reproductive outcomes. Using this approach, we were able to quantify the genetic contribution of each mate to the observed phenotypic variation in biologically important traits including mating speed, copulation duration, and subsequent offspring production, as well as measure the magnitude and direction of intersexual genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found significant additive genetic variation contributing to mating speed that can be attributed to male genetic identity, female genetic identity, but not their interaction. Furthermore we found that phenotypic variation in copulation duration had a significant male-associated genetic component. Female genetic identity and the interaction between male and female genetic identity accounted for a substantial amount of the observed phenotypic variation in egg size. Although previous research predicts a trade-off between egg size and fecundity, this was not evident in our results. We found a strong negative genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness, a result that suggests a potentially important role for sexually antagonistic alleles in sexual selection processes in our population.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      These results further our understanding of sexual selection because they identify that genetic identity plays a significant role in phenotypic variation in female behaviour and fecundity. This variation may be potentially due to ongoing sexual conflict found between the sexes for interacting phenotypes. Our unexpected observation of a negative correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness highlights the need for more explicit theoretical models of genetic covariance to investigate the coevolution of female choosiness and male attractiveness.",2014,"Hannah M E Tennant, Erin E Sonser, Tristan A f Long, Hannah M E Tennant, Erin E Sonser, Tristan A f Long"
External and circadian inputs modulate synaptic protein expression in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster,24772085,10.3389/fphys.2014.00102,"In the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster the retina photoreceptors form tetrad synapses with the first order interneurons, amacrine cells and glial cells in the first optic neuropil (lamina), in order to transmit photic and visual information to the brain. Using the specific antibodies against synaptic proteins; Bruchpilot (BRP), Synapsin (SYN), and Disc Large (DLG), the synapses in the distal lamina were specifically labeled. Then their abundance was measured as immunofluorescence intensity in flies held in light/dark (LD 12:12), constant darkness (DD), and after locomotor and light stimulation. Moreover, the levels of proteins (SYN and DLG), and mRNAs of the brp, syn, and dlg genes, were measured in the fly's head and brain, respectively. In the head we did not detect SYN and DLG oscillations. We found, however, that in the lamina, DLG oscillates in LD 12:12 and DD but SYN cycles only in DD. The abundance of all synaptic proteins was also changed in the lamina after locomotor and light stimulation. One hour locomotor stimulations at different time points in LD 12:12 affected the pattern of the daily rhythm of synaptic proteins. In turn, light stimulations in DD increased the level of all proteins studied. In the case of SYN, however, this effect was observed only after a short light pulse (15 min). In contrast to proteins studied in the lamina, the mRNA of brp, syn, and dlg genes in the brain was not cycling in LD 12:12 and DD, except the mRNA of dlg in LD 12:12. Our earlier results and obtained in the present study showed that the abundance of BRP, SYN and DLG in the distal lamina, at the tetrad synapses, is regulated by light and a circadian clock while locomotor stimulation affects their daily pattern of expression. The observed changes in the level of synaptic markers reflect the circadian plasticity of tetrad synapses regulated by the circadian clock and external inputs, both specific and unspecific for the visual system.",2014,"Wojciech Krzeptowski, Jolanta Górska-Andrzejak, Ewelina Kijak, Alicja Görlich, Elżbieta Guzik, Gareth Moore, Elżbieta M Pyza, Wojciech Krzeptowski, Jolanta Górska-Andrzejak, Ewelina Kijak, Alicja Görlich, Elżbieta Guzik, Gareth Moore, Elżbieta M Pyza"
Proteomic characterization of a temperature-sensitive conditional lethal in Drosophila melanogaster,19812620,10.1038/hdy.2009.132,"Genetic variation that is expressed only under specific environmental conditions can contribute to additional adverse effects of inbreeding if environmental conditions change. We present a proteomic characterization of a conditional lethal found in an inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster. The lethal effect is apparent as a large increase in early mortality at the restrictive temperature (29 degrees C) as opposed to normal survival at the permissive temperature (20 degrees C). The increased mortality in response to the restrictive temperature is probably caused by a single recessive major locus. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) region segregating variation affecting the lethal effect has been identified, allowing for a separation of primary/causal effects and secondary consequences in the proteome expression patterns observed. In this study, the proteomic response to the restrictive temperature in the lethal-line (L-line) was compared with the response in an inbred-control-line (IC-line) and an outbred-control-line (OC-line). Quantitative protein changes were detected using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In all, 45 proteins were found to be significantly differently regulated in response to the restrictive temperature in the L-line as compared with the IC-line. No proteins were significantly differently regulated between the IC-line and the OC-line, verifying that differential protein regulation was specific to a genetic defect in the L-line. Proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria were significantly overrepresented within the list of differentially expressed proteins. Proteins related to muscle contraction were also found to be differentially expressed in the L-line in response to the restrictive temperature, supporting phenotypic observations of moribund muscle hyper-contraction.",2010,"K S Pedersen, M C Codrea, C J Vermeulen, V Loeschcke, E Bendixen, K S Pedersen, M C Codrea, C J Vermeulen, V Loeschcke, E Bendixen"
Significance of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) as the target of diflubenzuron in chitin synthesis inhibition in Drosophila melanogaster and Blattella germanica,15262279,10.1016/j.ibmb.2004.03.009,"Diflubenzuron (DIMILIN) is a powerful insecticidal chemical which has been known for many years to inhibit chitin synthesis in vivo in insects and related arthropod species. However, its action mechanism has remained unresolved partly because of its inaction on any of the enzymes involved in chitin synthesis in vitro. Based on our previous work (Diflubenzuron affects gamma-thioGTP stimulated Ca2+ transport in vitro in intracellular vesicles from the integument of the newly molted American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 24 (1994) 1009) showing that diflubenzuron inhibits Ca2+ uptake by vesicles obtained from the integument of American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.), in vitro, we tested the hypothesis that the action site of diflubenzuron is an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter, probably a sulfonylurea-sensitive transporter. Glibenclamide, one of the most commonly used sulfonylureas for type II diabetes treatment, was the positive control. When given to immature insects, glibenclamide clearly caused toxicity, with symptoms indicating molting abnormality comparable to diflubenzuron. Its LD50 (0.472 microg/nymph) was approximately 2.8 times the value obtained for diflubenzuron (0.17 microg/nymph, topical) in German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). However, in terms of the inhibitory activities on chitin synthesis, in isolated integuments glibenclamide showed an identical potency to diflubenzuron in B. germanica nymphs. A competitive binding assay with [3H]-glibenclamide and unlabeled diflubenzuron clearly established that the latter is capable of competitively displacing the former radioligand. The KD values observed for vesicles prepared from fruit fly larvae, Drosophila melanogaster M., were 44.9 nM for glibenclamide and 65.0 nM for diflubenzuron, respectively. Furthermore, glibenclamide was found to affect Ca2+ uptake by isolated cuticular vesicles from B. germanica in a manner very similar to diflubenzuron. These results support our conclusion that the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) is the target of diflubenzuron in inhibition of chitin synthesis in these two insect species.",2004,"Gamal E Abo-Elghar, Phillip Fujiyoshi, Fumio Matsumura, Gamal E Abo-Elghar, Phillip Fujiyoshi, Fumio Matsumura"
The S6 kinase signaling pathway in the control of development and growth,12415748,10.4067/s0716-97602002000200022,"The discussion will focus on the role of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) signaling pathway in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Although 40S ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation was first described 25 years ago (Gressner and Wool, 1974), it only recently has been implicated in the translational up-regulation of mRNAs coding for the components of protein synthetic apparatus (Fumagalli and Thomas, 2000). These mRNAs contain an oligopyrimidine tract at their 5' transcriptional start site, termed a 5'TOP, which has been shown to be essential for their regulation at the translational level (Meyuhas et al., 1996). In parallel, a great deal of information has accumulated concerning the identification of the signaling pathway and the regulatory phosphorylation sites involved in controlling S6K activation (Dufner and Thomas, 1999). Despite this knowledge we are only beginning to identify the direct upstream elements involved in growth factor-induced kinase activation (Dennis et al., 2001; Pullen et al., 1998). Use of the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a bacterial macrolide, in conjunction with dominant interfering and activated forms of S6K1 has helped to establish the role of this signaling cascade in the regulation of growth and proliferation (Dennis and Thomas, 2002). In addition, current studies employing the mouse as well as Drosophila melanogaster have provided new insights into physiological function of S6K in the animal (Montagne et al., 1999; Pende et al., 2000). Loss of dS6K function in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated its paramount importance in development and growth control (Montagne et al., 1999), whereas deletion of the S6K1 gene in the mouse led to an animal of reduced size and the identification of the S6K1 homologue, S6K2 (Shima et al., 1998). Such mice are significantly smaller during fetal development (Shima et al., 1998) and hypoinsulinemic in the adult, conditions known to lead to type 2 diabetes (Pende et al., 2000).",2002,"George Thomas, George Thomas"
[Brain central regions in courtship sound production in Drosophila melanogaster],11534204,,"There are debates about the function of the two main central brain structures of insects--mushroom bodies and the central complex--in the control of motor co-ordination and triggering of different behaviour programs including sound production. To throw additional light onto this problem we analysed the parameters of the love song produced by 5-day old males courting for 5 minutes a fertilised CS female at 25 degrees C, in two wild-type strains of Drosophila melanogaster (Berlin and CS), hydroxyurea (HU)-treated flies (chemical ablation of the mushroom bodies) two mushroom body mutants (mbm1 and mud1), two central complex mutants (ccbKS127 and cexKS181) and a mutant cxbN71 with defects both in the mushroom bodies and in the central complex. It was found that the love song of HU-treated flies devoid of the mushroom bodies is very similar to that of wild-type flies. In mbm1 and mud1 the main parameters of the song (interpulse interval, IPI, and train duration) are slightly shifted from those of wild type but the sharpness of tuning of the pulse oscillator is the same. The flies of all these strains are equal to wild-type strains in mating success (% of copulations with virgins in 10-min test). On the contrary, the songs of the central complex mutants differ from those of wild-type flies. First of all, the sharpness of tuning of the pulse oscillator is destroyed,--the IPIs become highly variable. The pulses often are much longer and polycyclic as in well known cacophony mutant. The mean duration of pulse trains is much shorter. The males of the mutant cexKS181 usually court violently, but in most cases abnormal sounds are produced. Both cexKS181 and ccbKS127 males are much less successful in matings in comparison to wild-type flies. One can conclude that the central complex plays probably a very important role in the control of singing, whereas the mushroom bodies are practically not involved in this function.",2001,"A V Popov, N A Sitnik, E V Savvateeva-Popova, W Reinhard, M Heisenberg, A V Popov, N A Sitnik, E V Savvateeva-Popova, W Reinhard, M Heisenberg"
Wing-beat frequency mutants and courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster males,9583239,10.1023/a:1021476125052,"Flightless mutations that affect wing-beat frequency (WBF) of Drosophila melanogaster were examined for their effect on male courtship. WBFs were measured using a fixed-wire tether that completely supports the fly in an attitude similar to hovering flight. The two spontaneous mutations, one of which reduces WBF to one-half normal and the other to zero, were placed on an isogenic background and were compared to an isogenic wildtype strain and to a genetically heterogeneous wildtype strain. Time to mating under noncompetitive conditions (single pair matings) was not significantly different among the four male types in one experiment. In a second experiment, although the time to mating varied significantly among the four male types, there was no association between the WBF that was characteristic of a male type and the length of time to mating. Time to mating was not significantly correlated with WBF, wing size, or body mass in either experiment. Genetically heterogeneous wild-type females were significantly more receptive (had shorter times to mating) than inbred wild-type females toward all four male types. During the time-to-mating tests, all four male types appeared to show typical courtship behaviors. Therefore, the male types were compared for possible differences in four components of the male courtship song: sine song frequency, interpulse interval, intrapulse frequency (= carrier frequency), and wing cycles per pulse. One or another of these components showed significant differences among the four male types (e.g., genetically heterogeneous, wild-type males showed a significantly higher sine song frequency and intrapulse frequency than males of the three isogenic types). However, the average values for all four male types were within reported wild-type ranges for each courtship song component. Although the two mutations drastically reduce WBF during tethered flight, they do not have any similar major effect on courtship. Apparently they affect muscles or neuronal control mechanisms that are not common elements shared by the wing movement of flight and male courtship song.",1998,"P T Barnes, L Sullivan, A Villella, P T Barnes, L Sullivan, A Villella"
Processing of artificial visual feedback in the walking fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,9172415,,"A computerized 360 degrees panorama allowed us to suppress most of the locomotion-induced visual feedback of a freely walking fly without neutralizing its mechanosensory system ('virtual open-loop' conditions). This novel paradigm achieves control over the fly's visual input by continuously evaluating its actual position and orientation. In experiments with natural visual feedback (closed-loop conditions), the optomotor turning induced by horizontal pattern motion in freely walking Drosophila melanogaster increased with the contrast and brightness of the stimulus. Conspicuously striped patterns were followed with variable speed but often without significant overall slippage. Using standard open-loop conditions in stationary walking flies and virtual open-loop or closed-loop conditions in freely walking flies, we compared horizontal turning induced by either horizontal or vertical motion of appropriately oriented rhombic figures. We found (i) that horizontal displacements and the horizontal-motion illusion induced by vertical displacements of the oblique edges of the rhombic figures elicited equivalent open-loop turning responses; (ii) that locomotion-induced visual feedback from the vertical edges of the rhombic figures in a stationary horizontal position diminished the closed-loop turning elicited by vertical displacements to only one-fifth of the response to horizontal displacements; and (iii) that virtual open-loop responses of mobile flies and open-loop responses of immobilized flies were equivalent in spite of delays of up to 0.1 s in the generation of the virtual stimulus. Horizontal compensatory turning upon vertical displacements of oblique edges is quantitatively consistent with the direction-selective summation of signals from an array of elementary motion detectors for the horizontal stimulus components within their narrow receptive fields. A compensation of the aperture-induced ambiguity can be excluded under these conditions. However, locomotion-induced visual feedback greatly diminished the horizontal-motion illusion in a freely walking fly. The illusion was used to assay the quality of open-loop simulation in the new paradigm.",1997,"R Strauss, S Schuster, K G Götz, R Strauss, S Schuster, K G Götz"
Erratum to Mutation spectrum of 2-chloroethyl methanesulfonate in Drosophila melanogaster premeiotic germ cells' [Mutation Res. 331 (1995) 213-224],8692201,10.1016/0027-5107(95)00248-0,"The 2-chloroethyl methanesulfonate (2CIEMS)-induced alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) null germline mutation frequency in treated Drosophila melanogaster second instar larval gonia was two orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous mutation frequency. DNA sequence analysis of 83 Adh null mutations showed that 40 mutations of independent origin were at 23 sites in the Adh gene. The mutation spectrum contained only GC --> AT transitions with 35 mutations (87.5%) at the middle or 3' guanine. In addition, characteristics of glutathione (GSH)-mediated bioactivation were determined for 2CIEMS in vitro. Rates of GSH-mediated conjugation, catalyzed by purified rat liver glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and binding of [35S]GSH-mediated conjugation products to calf thymus DNA were determined for 2CIEMS, 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC) and 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB). The relative rates of GSH-mediated conjugation were the following: 5 mM EDB > 40 mM 2CIEMS > 40 mM EDC. A similar trend was observed for DNA binding of the [35S]GSH-mediated conjugation products when differences in mutagen concentration were considered: EDB > 2CIEMS > EDC. The ratios of DNA binding to GSH conjugation calculated for EDB, EDC and 2CIEMS were 6.8 x 10(-5), 9.3 x 10(-5) and 19.1 x 10(-5), respectively. A narrow range, less than a 3-fold difference, in the ratios of DNA binding to GSH conjugation indicates that the bioactivation of 2CIEMS is mediated by the same mechanism as EDB and EDC. Consequently, 2CIEMS, EDC and EDB may induce a specific mutation in premeiotic germ cells.",1996,"N G Fossett, B J Byrne, A B Tucker, P Arbour-Reily, S Chang, W R Lee, N G Fossett, B J Byrne, A B Tucker, P Arbour-Reily, S Chang, W R Lee"
The somatic white-ivory eye spot test does not detect the same spectrum of genotoxic events as the wing somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster,8625958,10.1002/(SICI)1098-2280(1996)27:3<219::AID-EM7>3.0.CO;2-9,"A groups of six chemical compounds was tested in parallel in two different somatic genotoxicity assays in Drosophila melanogaster, the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) and the white-ivory eye spot test. The wing spot test makes use of the wing cell markers multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare (flr) and detects both mitotic recombination and various types of mutational events. The white-ivory eye spot test makes use of the white-ivory (wi) quadruplication and detects the somatic reversion of the recessive eye color mutation wi to the wild-type (w+). Three- or two-day-old larvae were fed chronically with the compounds ethylnitrosourea (ENU), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NNP), caffeine (CAF), chromium (VI) oxide (CRO), potassium chromate (POC), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). All six compounds are genotoxic to various degrees in the wing spot test. The percentage of the genotoxic activity that is due to mitotic recombination was between 84% and 91% for the hexavalent chromium compounds CRO and POC and about 68% for 2,4-D. In contrast, ENU and NNP showed only 46% and 25% recombinagenic activity, respectively. In the white-ivory eye spot test, the three compounds (CRO, POC, and 2,4-D) with high recombinagenic activity and CAF were clearly nongenotoxic, whereas only ENU and NNP gave a positive response. From these results, it is concluded that the spectrum of genotoxic events detected by the two assays is different. In particular, the white-ivory eye spot test appears not to detect mitotic recombination the way the wing spot test does.",1996,"U Graf, F E Würgler, U Graf, F E Würgler"
High resolution mapping of genetic factors affecting abdominal bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster,7768438,,"Factors responsible for selection response for abdominal bristle number and correlated responses in sternopleural bristle number were mapped to the X and third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster. Lines divergent for high and low abdominal bristle number were created by 25 generations of artificial selection from a large base population, with an intensity of 25 individuals of each sex selected from 100 individuals of each sex scored per generation. Isogenic chromosome substitution lines in which the high (H) X or third chromosome were placed in an isogenic low (L) background were derived from the selection lines and from the 93 recombinant isogenic (RI) HL X and 67 RI chromosome 3 lines constructed from them. Highly polymorphic neutral roo transposable elements were hybridized in situ to the polytene chromosomes of the RI lines to create a set of cytogenetic markers. These techniques yielded a dense map with an average spacing of 4 cM between informative markers. Factors affecting bristle number, and relative viability of the chromosome 3 RI lines, were mapped using a multiple regression interval mapping approach, conditioning on all markers > or = 10 cM from the tested interval. Two factors with large effects on abdominal bristle number were mapped on the X chromosome and five factors on the third chromosome. One factor with a large effect on sternopleural bristle number was mapped to the X and two were mapped to the third chromosome; all factors with sternopleural effects corresponded to those with effects on abdominal bristle number. Two of the chromosome 3 factors with large effects on abdominal bristle number were also associated with reduced viability. Significant sex-specific effects and epistatic interactions between mapped factors of the same order of magnitude as the additive effects were observed.

Are Drosophila melanogaster populations under a stable geographical differentiation due to the presence of P elements?,2504684,10.1038/hdy.1989.74,"In order to simulate the outcome of the P-M status of Eurasian populations of Drosophila melanogaster, the evolution of experimental mixed-strains was monitored for up to 50 generations. The results were compared with the evolution in natura of European populations sampled in 1981-83 and 1986-87 over a similar period of time. Different combinations of P and M' strains, Q and M' strains, M' and M' strains and M and M' strains were set up at 25 degrees C and duplicated at 13 degrees C night-21 degrees C day. The possibility of a change towards a P type only appeared with the introduction of the strong P strain Harwich into Eurasian strains. Strains with strength similar to that of Harwich are not currently found in wild populations. With the introduction of weak P and Q strains of the strength presently observed in western Europe, experimental populations evolved slowly towards a Q state or a weak M' state. M'-M' mixed populations resulted in strong M' strains, as was the case for M-M' populations. In these cases. P sequences were not eliminated. In wild populations both genetic and molecular analyses showed no significant differences, over a five year period, for GD sterility potentials, for total P copy number or for distribution of the full-sized and KP elements. Changes in Eurasian populations are probably taking place at a very low rate and may even have stopped, leading to a quasi-stable differentiation over the continent. During the different steps of progressive invasion of P transposable elements, several deleted elements developed and natural selection may have acted on them. The possibility of the selection of different types of regulatory mechanisms according to the presence of different kinds of derivative elements, leading to a world-wide differentiation between P-Q and M' strains is discussed.",1989,"G Periquet, S Ronsseray, M H Hamelin, G Periquet, S Ronsseray, M H Hamelin"
"Genotype-by-environment and epistatic interactions in Drosophila melanogaster: the effects of Gpdh allozymes, genetic background and rearing temperature on larval developmental time and viability",2503425,,"The possible role of temperature as a component of natural selection generating the latitudinal clines in Gpdh allele frequencies in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster was examined. Effects of rearing temperature (16 degrees, 22 degrees and 29 degrees) and of Gpdh allozymes (S and F) on larval developmental time and viability were measured. Eight genetic backgrounds from each of three populations (continents) were used to assess the generality of any effects. Analyses of variance indicated significant temperature effects and allozyme-by-genetic background interaction effects for both characters. Viability showed significant genetic background effects, as well as significant temperature-by-allozyme and temperature-by-allozyme-by-population interactions. In general, the S/S genotype was significantly lower in viability than the F/F and F/S genotypes at extreme temperatures (16 degrees and 29 degrees), with no significant differences at 22 degrees. However, each population had a slightly different pattern of viability associated with temperature, and only the Australian population showed a pattern that could contribute to the observed cline formation. Although the same two interactions were not significant for developmental time, examination of the means showed that the S/S genotype had a slightly faster rate of development at 16 degrees than the F/F genotype in all populations (by an average of 0.25 day or 1.1%). The low temperature effect on developmental time is consistent with the clines observed in nature, with the S allele increasing in frequency with higher latitudes. The results for both viability and developmental time are consistent with the interpretation of Gpdh as a minor polygene affecting physiological phenotypes, as indicated by previous work with adult flight metabolism. Finally, it is proposed that the temperature-dependent antagonistic effects of the allozymes on viability vs. developmental time and flight metabolism may be the underlying force giving rise to the worldwide polymorphism.",1989,"P T Barnes, B Holland, V Courreges, P T Barnes, B Holland, V Courreges"
Large changes in intracellular pH and calcium observed during heat shock are not responsible for the induction of heat shock proteins in Drosophila melanogaster,3097504,10.1128/mcb.6.5.1767,"Heat shock caused significant changes in intracellular pH (pHi) and intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) which occurred rapidly after temperature elevation. pHi fell from a resting level value at 25 degrees C of 7.38 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- standard error of the mean, n = 15) to 6.91 +/- 0.11 (n = 7) at 35 degrees C.

"Recombination, dominance and selection on amino acid polymorphism in the Drosophila genome: contrasting patterns on the X and fourth chromosomes",14668375,,"Surveys of nucleotide polymorphism and divergence indicate that the average selection coefficient on Drosophila proteins is weakly positive. Similar surveys in mitochondrial genomes and in the selfing plant Arabidopsis show that weak negative selection has operated. These differences have been attributed to the low recombination environment of mtDNA and Arabidopsis that has hindered adaptive evolution through the interference effects of linkage. We test this hypothesis with new sequence surveys of proteins lying in low recombination regions of the Drosophila genome. We surveyed >3800 bp across four proteins at the tip of the X chromosome and >3600 bp across four proteins on the fourth chromosome in 24 strains of D. melanogaster and 5 strains of D. simulans. This design seeks to study the interaction of selection and linkage by comparing silent and replacement variation in semihaploid (X chromosome) and diploid (fourth chromosome) environments lying in regions of low recombination. While the data do indicate very low rates of exchange, all four gametic phases were observed both at the tip of the X and across the fourth chromosome. Silent variation is very low at the tip of the X (thetaS = 0.0015) and on the fourth chromosome (thetaS = 0.0002), but the tip of the X shows a greater proportional loss of variation than the fourth shows relative to normal-recombination regions. In contrast, replacement polymorphism at the tip of the X is not reduced (thetaR = 0.00065, very close to the X chromosome average). MK and HKA tests both indicate a significant excess of amino acid polymorphism at the tip of the X relative to the fourth. Selection is significantly negative at the tip of the X (Nes = -1.53) and nonsignificantly positive on the fourth (Nes approximately 2.9), analogous to the difference between mtDNA (or Arabidopsis) and the Drosophila genome average. Our distal X data are distinct from regions of normal recombination where the X shows a deficiency of amino acid polymorphism relative to the autosomes, suggesting more efficient selection against recessive deleterious replacement mutations. We suggest that the excess amino acid polymorphism on the distal X relative to the fourth chromosome is due to (1) differences in the mutation rate for selected mutations on the distal X or (2) a greater relaxation of selection from stronger linkage-related interference effects on the distal X. This relaxation of selection is presumed to be greater in magnitude than the difference in efficiency of selection between X-linked vs. autosomal selection.",2003,"Lea A Sheldahl, Daniel M Weinreich, David M Rand, Lea A Sheldahl, Daniel M Weinreich, David M Rand"

      RNA interference (RNAi) is a process triggered by a double-stranded RNA that leads to targeted down-regulation/silencing of gene expression and can be used for functional genomics; i.e. loss-of-function studies. Here we report on the use of RNAi in the identification of a developmentally important novel Drosophila (fruit fly) gene (corresponding to a putative gene CG5652/GM06434), that we named beltless based on an embryonic loss-of-function phenotype.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Beltless mRNA is expressed in all developmental stages except in 0-6 h embryos. In situ RT-PCR localized beltless mRNA in the ventral cord and brain of late stage embryos and in the nervous system, ovaries, and the accessory glands of adult flies. RNAi was induced by injection of short (22 bp) beltless double-stranded RNAs into embryos or into adult flies. Embryonic RNAi altered cuticular phenotypes ranging from partially-formed to missing denticle belts (thus beltless) of the abdominal segments A2-A4. Embryonic beltless RNAi was lethal. Adult RNAi resulted in the shrinkage of the ovaries by half and reduced the number of eggs laid. We also examined Df(1)RK4 flies in which deletion removes 16 genes, including beltless. In some embryos, we observed cuticular abnormalities similar to our findings with beltless RNAi. After differentiating Df(1)RK4 embryos into those with visible denticle belts and those missing denticle belts, we assayed the presence of beltless mRNA; no beltless mRNA was detectable in embryos with missing denticle belts.

      We have identified a developmentally important novel Drosophila gene, beltless, which has been characterized in loss-of-function studies using RNA interference. The putative beltless protein shares homologies with the C. elegans nose resistant to fluoxetine (NRF) NRF-6 gene, as well as with several uncharacterized C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genes, some with prominent acyltransferase domains.

Drosophila melanogaster mini spindles TOG3 utilizes unique structural elements to promote domain stability and maintain a TOG1- and TOG2-like tubulin-binding surface,25720490,10.1074/jbc.M114.633826,"Microtubule-associated proteins regulate microtubule (MT) dynamics spatially and temporally, which is essential for proper formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. The XMAP215 family is comprised of conserved microtubule-associated proteins that use an array of tubulin-binding tumor overexpressed gene (TOG) domains, consisting of six (A-F) Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, target of rapamycin (HEAT) repeats, to robustly increase MT plus-end polymerization rates. Recent work showed that TOG domains have differentially conserved architectures across the array, with implications for position-dependent TOG domain tubulin binding activities and function within the XMAP215 MT polymerization mechanism. Although TOG domains 1, 2, and 4 are well described, structural and mechanistic information characterizing TOG domains 3 and 5 is outstanding. Here, we present the structure and characterization of Drosophila melanogaster Mini spindles (Msps) TOG3. Msps TOG3 has two unique features as follows: the first is a C-terminal tail that stabilizes the ultimate four HEAT repeats (HRs), and the second is a unique architecture in HR B. Structural alignments of TOG3 with other TOG domain structures show that the architecture of TOG3 is most similar to TOG domains 1 and 2 and diverges from TOG4. Docking TOG3 onto recently solved Stu2 TOG1· and TOG2·tubulin complex structures suggests that TOG3 uses similarly conserved tubulin-binding intra-HEAT loop residues to engage α- and β-tubulin. This indicates that TOG3 has maintained a TOG1- and TOG2-like TOG-tubulin binding mode despite structural divergence. The similarity of TOG domains 1-3 and the divergence of TOG4 suggest that a TOG domain array with polarized structural diversity may play a key mechanistic role in XMAP215-dependent MT polymerization activity.",2015,"Amy E Howard, Jaime C Fox, Kevin C Slep, Amy E Howard, Jaime C Fox, Kevin C Slep"
Photoactivation of cryptochromes from Drosophila melanogaster and Sylvia borin: insight into the chemical compass mechanism by computational investigation,25710635,10.1021/jp508871h,"Although behavioral studies demonstrated light-induced magnetoreception in the insect Drosophila melanogaster, gaining insight into the possibility that a radical-pair mechanism accounts for the magnetic response of the cryptochrome (DmCry1) is complicated by a number of factors. In addition, the mechanism of magnetoreception for the cryptochrome from the garden warbler bird Sylvia borin (gwCry1a), which demonstrated a long-lived radical pair by transient optical absorption measurements, has also not been rationalized. To assess potential feasibility of a radical-pair mechanism in DmCry1 and gwCry1a, formed by excitation and electron transfer between a Trp-triad and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), further separated by electron transfer within the triad, we applied a combination of theoretical methods, including homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) for structure refinement, high-level ab initio theory, and MD simulations using a polarizable force-field for prediction of pKa and the electron transfer rate. Calculated excitation energies, followed by electron transfer in model compounds of DmCry1 that assume proton transfer in conjunction with electron transfer from Trp (W420) to FAD and the predicted pKa for the proximate residue to FAD (Cys416), support a radical-pair mechanism. Furthermore, free-energy and reorganization energies for the Trp-triad in DmCry1 demonstrate facile electron transfer, explained by the local protein environment and exposure to solvent, which in turn enables a large enough distance separation for the radical-pair partners. Results for gwCry1a demonstrated the importance of accounting for relaxed excited-state geometries in validating the first stage of a radical-pair mechanism. This work provides insight into the so-called chemical compass mechanism to explain magnetic-field sensing in DmCry1 and gwCry1a, expanding on previous work on the cyrptochrome from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Solov'yov et al.

Potent anticancer effects of lentivirus encoding a Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase mutant combined with brivudine,22901180,10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.5.2121,"Objective:
      
    

    
      Deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) mutants have been reported to exert suicide gene effects in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. Here, we aimed to further evaluate the capacity of the mutanted enzyme and its potential for inhibiting cancer cell growth.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      We altered the sequence of the last 10 amino acids of Dm-dNK to perform site-directed mutagenesis and constructed active site mutanted Dm-dNK (Dm-dNKmut), RT-PCR and western bloting studies were used to reveal the expression of lentivirus mediated Dm-dNKmut in a breast cancer cell line (Bcap37), a gastric cancer cell line (SGC7901) and a colorectal cancer cell line (CCL187). [3H]-labeled substrates were used for enzyme activity assays, cell cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assays, cell proliferation using a hemocytometer and apoptosis induction by thenannexin-V-FITC labeled FACS method. In vivo, an animal study was set out in which BALB/C nude mice bearing tumors were treated with lentivirus mediated expression of Dm-dNKmut with the pyrimidine nucleoside analog brivudine (BVDU, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-(2-deoxyuridine).
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The Dm-dNKmut could be stably expressed in the cancer cell lines and retained its enzymatic activity. Moreover, the cells expressing Dm-dNKmut exhibited increased sensitivity in combination with BVDU, with induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      These findings underlined the importance of BVDU phosphorylated by Dm-dNKmut in transduced cancer cells and the potential role of Dm-dNKmut as a suicide gene, thus providing the basis for future intensive research for cancer therapy.",2012,"Nian-Qu Zhang, Lei Zhao, Shuai Ma, Ming Gu, Xin-Yu Zheng, Nian-Qu Zhang, Lei Zhao, Shuai Ma, Ming Gu, Xin-Yu Zheng"
The chromosomal association/dissociation of the chromatin insulator protein Cp190 of Drosophila melanogaster is mediated by the BTB/POZ domain and two acidic regions,21194420,10.1186/1471-2121-11-101,"Background:
      
    

    
      Chromatin insulators or boundary elements are a class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome. They regulate gene transcription by interfering with promoter-enhancer communication. The Cp190 protein of Drosophila melanogaster is essential to the function of at least three-types of chromatin insulator complexes organized by Su(Hw), CTCF and BEAF32.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We mapped functional regions of Cp190 in vivo and identified three domains that are essential for the insulator function and for the viability of flies: the BTB/POZ domain, an aspartic acid-rich (D-rich) region and a C-terminal glutamic acid-rich (E-rich) region. Other domains including the centrosomal targeting domain and the zinc fingers are dispensable. The N-terminal CP190BTB-D fragment containing the BTB/POZ domain and the D-rich region is sufficient to mediate association with all three types of insulator complexes. The fragment however is not sufficient for insulator activity or viability. The Cp190 and CP190BTB-D are regulated differently in cells treated with heat-shock. The Cp190 dissociated from chromosomes during heat-shock, indicating that dissociation of Cp190 with chromosomes can be regulated. In contrast, the CP190BTB-D fragment didn't dissociate from chromosomes in the same heat-shocked condition, suggesting that the deleted C-terminal regions have a role in regulating the dissociation of Cp190 with chromosomes.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      The N-terminal fragment of Cp190 containing the BTB/POZ domain and the D-rich region mediates association of Cp190 with all three types of insulator complexes and that the E-rich region of Cp190 is required for dissociation of Cp190 from chromosomes during heat-shock. The heat-shock-induced dissociation is strong evidence indicating that dissociation of the essential insulator protein Cp190 from chromosomes is regulated. Our results provide a mechanism through which activities of an insulator can be modulated by internal and external cues.",2010,"Daniel Oliver, Brian Sheehan, Heather South, Omar Akbari, Chi-Yun Pai, Daniel Oliver, Brian Sheehan, Heather South, Omar Akbari, Chi-Yun Pai"
"Providencia sneebia sp. nov. and Providencia burhodogranariea sp. nov., isolated from wild Drosophila melanogaster",19406801,10.1099/ijs.0.000117-0,"Multiple isolates of the genus Providencia were obtained from the haemolymph of wild-caught Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. Sixteen isolates were distinguished from the six previously described species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. These isolates belonged to two distinct groups, which we propose each comprise previously undescribed species. Two isolates, designated A(T) and B(T), were characterized by DNA sequences of the fusA, lepA, leuS, gyrB and ileS housekeeping genes, whole-genome DNA-DNA hybridizations with their nearest relatives and utilization of substrates for metabolism. The closest phylogenetic relatives of strain A(T) are strain B(T) (86.9 % identity for the housekeeping genes) and Providencia stuartii DSM 4539(T) (86.0 % identity). The closest phylogenetic relatives of strain B(T) are strain A(T) (86.9 % identity) and P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) (86.6 % identity). The type strains of described species in this genus shared between 84.1 and 90.1 % identity for these sequences. DNA-DNA hybridization between the strain pairs A(T)-B(T), A(T)-P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) and B(T)-P. stuartii DSM 4539(T) all resulted in less than 25 % relatedness. In addition, patterns of utilization of amygdalin, arbutin, aesculin, salicin, d-sorbitol, trehalose, inositol, d-adonitol and d-galactose distinguish strains A(T) and B(T) from other members of this genus.

Kinetic response of a Drosophila melanogaster cell line to different medium formulations and culture conditions,19003169,10.1007/s10616-008-9146-z,"In the past few years, Drosophila melanogaster cells have been employed for recombinant protein production purposes, and a comprehensive knowledge of their metabolism is essential for process optimization. In this work, the kinetic response of a Schneider S2 cell line, grown in shake flasks, in two different culture media, the serum-free SF900-II((R)) and the serum-supplemented TC-100, was evaluated. Cell growth, amino acids and glucose uptake, and lactate synthesis were measured allowing the calculation of kinetic parameters. The results show that S2 cells metabolism was able to adjust to different environmental situations, as determined by medium formulation, as well as by the particular situation resulting from the culture conditions. Cells attained a 163% higher final cell concentration (1.4 x 10(7) cells mL(-1)) in SF900 II((R)) medium, when compared to serum-supplemented TC-100 medium. Also, a maximum specific cell growth rate 52% higher in SF900 II((R) )medium, when compared to serum-supplemented TC-100 one, was observed. Glutamine was the growth limiting factor in SF900 II((R)) medium, while glucose, sometimes associated with glutamine, controlled growth in serum-supplemented TC-100 medium based formulation. The different pattern of lactate production is an example of the versatility of the metabolism of these cells. This by-product was produced only in glutamine limitation, but the amount synthesized depended not only on the excess glucose, but on other medium components. Therefore, in serum-supplemented TC-100 medium a much smaller lactate amount was generated. Besides, glucose was identified not only as a growth limiting factor, but also as a viability limiting factor, since its depletion accelerated cell death.",2008,"R Bovo, A L L Galesi, S A C Jorge, R A M Piccoli, A M Moraes, C A Pereira, E F P Augusto, R Bovo, A L L Galesi, S A C Jorge, R A M Piccoli, A M Moraes, C A Pereira, E F P Augusto"
Structural and biochemical studies reveal differences in the catalytic mechanisms of mammalian and Drosophila melanogaster thioredoxin reductases,17385893,10.1021/bi602394p,"Thioredoxin reductase (TR) from Drosophila melanogaster (DmTR) is a member of the glutathione reductase (GR) family of pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductases and catalyzes the reduction of the redox-active disulfide bond of thioredoxin. DmTR is notable for having high catalytic activity without the presence of a selenocysteine (Sec) residue (which is essential for the mammalian thioredoxin reductases). We report here the X-ray crystal structure of DmTR at 2.4 A resolution (Rwork = 19.8%, Rfree = 24.7%) in which the enzyme was truncated to remove the C-terminal tripeptide sequence Cys-Cys-Ser. We also demonstrate that tetrapeptides equivalent to the oxidized C-terminal active sites of both mouse mitochondrial TR (mTR3) and DmTR are substrates for the truncated forms of both enzymes. This truncated enzyme/peptide substrate system examines the kinetics of the ring-opening step that occurs during the enzymatic cycle of TR. The ring-opening step is 300-500-fold slower when Sec is replaced with Cys in mTR3 when using this system. Conversely, when Cys is replaced with Sec in DmTR, the rate of ring opening is only moderately increased (5-36-fold). Structures of these tetrapeptides were oriented in the active site of both enzymes using oxidized glutathione bound to GR as a template. DmTR has a more open tetrapeptide binding pocket than the mouse enzyme and accommodates the peptide Ser-Cys-Cys-Ser(ox) in a cis conformation that allows for the protonation of the leaving-group Cys by His464', which helps to explain why this TR can function without the need for Sec. In contrast, mTR3 shows a narrower pocket. One possible result of this narrower interface is that the mammalian redox-active tetrapeptide Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly may adopt a trans conformation for a better fit. This places the Sec residue farther away from the protonating histidine residue, but the lower pKa of Sec in comparison to that of Cys eliminates the need for Sec to be protonated.",2007,"Brian E Eckenroth, Mark A Rould, Robert J Hondal, Stephen J Everse, Brian E Eckenroth, Mark A Rould, Robert J Hondal, Stephen J Everse"
Mild heat stress at a young age in Drosophila melanogaster leads to increased Hsp70 synthesis after stress exposure later in life,15133188,10.1007/BF02715811,"In a number of animal species it has been shown that exposure to low levels of stress at a young age has a positive effect on stress resistance later in life, and on longevity. The positive effects have been attributed to the activation of defence/cleaning systems (heat shock proteins (Hsps), antioxidases, DNA repair) or to effects of a changed metabolic rate, or both. We investigated the effect of mild stress exposures early in life on Hsp70 synthesis after a harder stress exposure later in life in five isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies were either exposed to repeated bouts of mild heat stress (3 h at 34 degrees C) at a young age (days 2, 4 and 6 post-eclosion) or held under standard laboratory conditions. At 16 and 32 days of adult age, respectively, flies were exposed to a high-temperature treatment known to induce Hsp70 in the investigated species (1 h at 37 degrees C). Thereafter, the inducible Hsp70 levels were measured. Our data show a tendency towards increased Hsp70 synthesis with increased age for both 'mild stress' and 'no stress' flies. Moreover, the results show that flies exposed to mild stress at a young age synthesized more Hsp70 upon induction, compared to control flies, and that this difference was accentuated at 32 days compared to 16 days of age. Thus, bouts of mild heat stress at a young age impact on the physiological stress response system later in life. This may be caused by an increased ability to react to future stresses. Alternatively, the mild stress exposure at a young age may actually have caused cellular damages increasing the need for Hsp70 levels after stress exposure later in life. The importance of an Hsp70 upregulation (throughout life) in explaining the phenomenon of hormesis is discussed, together with alternative hypotheses, and suggestions for further studies.",2003,"Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Jesper Givskov Sørensen, Volker Loeschcke, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Jesper Givskov Sørensen, Volker Loeschcke"
O-ethylthymidine adducts are the most relevant damages for mutation induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in female germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster,12203408,10.1002/em.10101,"Responses to genotoxic agents vary not only among organisms, test systems, and cellular stages, but also between sexes; little, however, is known about the mutagenic consequences of chemical exposures to female germ cells. In this study, the mutagenicity of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) was analyzed in female germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster using the recessive-lethal test and the vermilion system, which simultaneously generates information on induced mutation frequency and mutation spectrum. ENU was mutagenic in all stages of oogenesis, although there were differences among the stages. In mature and immature oocytes, ENU-induced mutations in the vermilion locus were 43.5% A:T-->G:C transitions, 39.1% A:T-->T:A transversions, 8.7% G:C-->A:T transitions, and 8.7% A:T-->C:G transversions, indicating that the most important premutagenic lesions induced by this chemical are O(4)-ethylthymine and O(2)-ethylthymine. The low frequency of mutation involving O(6)-ethylguanine (i.e., G:C-->A:T transitions) could be a consequence of the repair of these lesions by O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase. Comparison of these results with those previously obtained in male germ cells stresses the importance of the repair activity of the analyzed cells, because the mutation spectrum in female germ cells was similar to the spectrum obtained with repair-proficient spermatogonial cells and different from repair-deficient postmeiotic cells. The results also indicate that studies with female germ cells could be an alternative to the use of premeiotic male germ cells, especially when the analysis of these cells is difficult or almost impossible and when studies of in vivo DNA repair in premeiotic germ cells are performed.",2002,"L Alvarez, M A Comendador, L M Sierra, L Alvarez, M A Comendador, L M Sierra"
Backbone dynamics for the wild type and a double H52R/T56W mutant of the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain from Drosophila melanogaster,11580276,10.1021/bi010398r,"The (15)N relaxation behavior and heteronuclear Overhauser effect data for the wild type and an H52R/T56W double mutant protein that encompasses the vnd/NK-2 homeodomain from Drosophila melanogaster were used to characterize and describe the protein backbone dynamics. This investigation, which includes a description of a model structure for the H52R/T56W double mutant vnd/NK-2 homeodomain, was carried out for the two proteins in both the free and DNA-bound states. The double residue replacement at positions 52 and 56 within the DNA recognition helix of vnd/NK-2 has been shown to lead to a significant secondary structural modification resulting in an increase in the length of the recognition helix for the unbound protein. These structural changes are accompanied by corresponding changes in the T(1) and T(1)(rho) relaxation times as well as in the heteronuclear Overhauser effect (XNOE) values that show that the structural stability of the protein is enhanced by the two residue replacements. The values of the rotational anisotropy, D(parallel)/D(perpendicular), derived from analysis of the (15)N T(1) and T(1)(rho) relaxation values are small (1.189 for the unbound homeodomain and 1.110 for the bound homeodomain; both analyzed as prolate ellipsoids of revolution). A comparison of the T(2) values of the wild type and double mutant homeodomain reveals the presence of a low-frequency exchange contribution for the wild type analogue. These relaxation studies show that the motional behavior of the protein primarily reflects the tertiary structure and stability of the homeodomain backbone as well as the respective changes induced upon site-directed residue replacement or DNA binding.",2001,"S Fausti, S Weiler, C Cuniberti, K J Hwang, K T No, J M Gruschus, A Perico, M Nirenberg, J A Ferretti, S Fausti, S Weiler, C Cuniberti, K J Hwang, K T No, J M Gruschus, A Perico, M Nirenberg, J A Ferretti"
Quantitative trait loci affecting components of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster,10835390,,"Two composite multiple regression-interval mapping analyses were performed to identify candidate quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting components of wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster defined by eight relative warp-based measures. A recombinant inbred line design was used to map QTL for the shape of two intervein regions in the anterior compartment of the wing, using a high resolution map of retrotransposon insertion sites between Oregon-R and Russian 2b. A total of 35 QTL representing up to 23 different loci were identified, many of which are located near components of the epidermal growth factor-Ras signal transduction pathway that regulates vein vs. intervein decision making and vein placement. Over one-half of the loci were detected in both sexes, and just under one-half were detected at two different growth temperatures. Different loci were found to affect aspects of shape in each intervein region, confirming that the shape of the whole wing should be regarded as a compound trait composed of several developmental units. In addition, a reciprocal backcross design was used to map QTL affecting shape in the posterior compartment of the wings of 831 flies, using a molecular map of 16 allele-specific oligohybridization single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers between two divergent inbred lines. A total of 13 QTL were detected and shown to have generally additive effects on separable components of shape, in both sexes. By contrast, 8 QTL that affected wing size in these backcrosses were nearly dominant in their effects. The results confirm at the genetic level that wing shape is regulated independent of wing size and set up the hypothesis that wing shape is regulated in part through the regulation of the length and positioning of wing veins, involving quantitative regulation of the activity of secreted growth factors.",2000,"E Zimmerman, A Palsson, G Gibson, E Zimmerman, A Palsson, G Gibson"
"Processing specificity and biosynthesis of the Drosophila melanogaster convertases dfurin1, dfurin1-CRR, dfurin1-X, and dfurin2",7836354,10.1074/jbc.270.3.1020,"Pro-protein and pro-hormone convertases are subtilisin/kexin-like enzymes implicated in the activation of numerous precursors by cleavage at sites mostly composed of pairs of basic amino acids. Six members of this family of enzymes have been identified in mammals and named furin (also called PACE), PC1 (also called PC3), PC2, PACE4, PC4, and PC5 (also called PC6). Multiple transcripts are produced for all the mammalian convertases, but only in the cases of PC4, PACE4, and PC5 does differential splicing result in the modification of the C-terminal sequence of these enzymes. A similar molecular diversity is also observed for the convertases of Hydra vulgaris, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. In the third species, two genes homologous to human furin called Dfur1 and Dfur2 have been identified. The Dfur1 gene undergoes differential splicing to generate three type I membrane-bound proteins called dfurin1, dfurin1-CRR, and dfurin1-X, which differ only in their C-terminal sequence. By using recombinant vaccinia viruses that express each of the dfurin proteins, we investigated the potential effect of the C-terminal domain on their catalytic specificities. For this purpose, these enzymes were coexpressed with the precursors pro-7B2, pro-opiomelanocortin, and pro-dynorphin in a number of cell lines, and the processed products obtained were characterized. Our studies demonstrate that these proteases display cleavage specificities similar to that of mammalian furin but not to that of PC2. In contrast, we noted significant differences in the biosynthetic fates of these convertases. All dfurins undergo rapid removal of their transmembrane domain within the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in the release of several truncated soluble forms. However, in the media of cells containing secretory granules, such as GH4C1 and AtT-20, dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 predominate over dfurin1, whereas dfurin1-X is never detected. While pro-segment removal occurs predominantly in the trans-Golgi network for all the dfurins, in the presence of brefeldin A, only dfurin1-CRR and dfurin2 can undergo partial zymogen cleavage.

A voltage-dependent gap junction in Drosophila melanogaster,1901743,10.1016/S0006-3495(91)82204-4,"Steady-state and kinetic analyses of gap junctional conductance, gi, in salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster third instar larvae reveal a strong and complex voltage dependence that can be elicited by two types of voltages. Voltages applied between the cells, i.e., transjunctional voltages, Vj, and those applied between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, inside-outside voltages, Vi,o, markedly alter gj. Alteration of Vi-o while holding Vj = O,i.e., by equal displacement of the voltages in the cells, causes gj to increase to a maximum on hyperpolarization and to decrease to near zero on depolarization. These conductance changes associated with Vi-o are fit by a model in which there are two independent gates in series, one in each series, one in each membrane, where each gate is equally sensitive to Vi-o and exhibits first order kinetics. Vj's generated by applying voltage steps of either polarity to either cell, substantially reduce gj. These conductance changes exhibit complex kinetics that depend on Vi-o as well as Vj. At more positive Vi-o's, the changes in gj have two phases, an early phase consisting of of a decrease in gj for either polarity of Vj and a later phase consisting of an increase in gj on hyperpolarizing either cell and a decrease on depolarizing either cell. At negative Vi-o's in the plateau region of the gj-Vi-o relation, the later slow increase in gj is absent on hyperpolarizing either cell. Also, the early decrease in gj for either polarity of Vj is faster the more positive the Vi-o. The complex time course elicited by applying voltage steps to one cell can be explained as combined actions of Vi-o and Vj, with the early phase ascribable to Vj, but influenced by Vi-o, and the later phase to the changes in Vi-o associated with the generation of Vj. The substantially different kinetics and sensitivity of changes in gj by Vi-o and Vj suggests that the mechanisms of gating by these two voltages are different. Evidently, these gap-junction channels are capable of two distinct, but interactive forms of voltage dependence.",1991,"V K Verselis, M V Bennett, T A Bargiello, V K Verselis, M V Bennett, T A Bargiello"
Experimental population genetics of meiotic drive systems. I. Pseudo-Y chromosomal drive as a means of eliminating cage populations of Drosophila melanogaster,407130,,"The experimental population genetics of Y-chromosome drive in Drosophila melanogaster is approximated by studying the behavior of T(Y;2),SD lines. These exhibit ""pseudo-Y"" drive through the effective coupling of the Y chromosome to the second chromosome meiotic drive locus, Segregation distorter (SD). T(Y;2),SD males consequently produce only male offspring. When such lines are allowed to compete against structurally normal SD(+) flies in population cages, T(Y;2),SD males increase in frequency according to the dynamics of a simple haploid selection model until the cage population is eliminated as a result of a deficiency in the number of adult females. Cage population extinction generally occurs within about seven generations.-Several conclusions can be drawn from these competition cage studies:(1) Fitness estimates for the T(Y;2),SD lines (relative to SD(+ )) are generally in the range of 2-4, and these values are corroborated by independent estimates derived from studies of migration-selection equilibrium. (2) Fitness estimates are unaffected by cage replication, sample time, or the starting frequency of T(Y;2),SD males, indicating that data from diverse cages can be legitimately pooled to give an overall fitness estimate. (3) Partitioning of the T(Y;2),SD fitnesses into components of viability, fertility, and frequency of alternate segregation (Y + SD from X + SD(+)) suggests that most of the T(Y;2),SD advantage derives from the latter two components. Improvements in the system might involve increasing both the viability and the alternate segregation to increase the total fitness. While pseudo-Y drive operates quite effectively against laboratory stocks, it is less successful in eliminating wild-type populations which are already segregating for suppressors of SD action. This observation suggests that further studies into the origin and rate of accumulation of suppressors of meiotic drive are needed before an overall assessment can be made of the potential of Y-chromosome drive as a tool for population control.",1977,"T W Lyttle, T W Lyttle"

It was observed that HD's consumption was associated with lower survival of the flies, lower longevity, and increased levels of glucose, triglycerides, TBARS and increased SOD activities and CAT activities. Treatment with 25 μM 4-PSQ increased the satiety of flies, increased survival, reduced glucose, triglyceride and TBARS levels, increased hatching, and normalized SOD and CAT activities.

In this study, we examined the effects of trauma on the expression of genes in Drosophila melanogaster, a useful model for investigating genetics and physiology. After trauma was induced by a non-lethal needle puncture of the thorax, we observed the differential expression of genes encoding for mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, as well as those encoding for apoptosis-related and insulin signaling-related proteins, thus indicating muscle functional dysregulation. These results prompted us to examine the link between insulin signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction using in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with complementary electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Trauma significantly increased insulin resistance biomarkers, and the NMR spectral profile of the aged flies with trauma-induced thoracic injury resembled that of insulin-resistant chico mutant flies. In addition, the mitochondrial redox status, as measured by EPR, was significantly altered following trauma, indicating mitochondrial uncoupling. A mitochondria-targeted compound, Szeto-Schiller (SS)-31 that promotes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis normalized the NMR spectral profile, as well as the mitochondrial redox status of the flies with trauma-induced thoracic injury, as assessed by EPR. Based on these findings, we propose a molecular mechanism responsible for trauma-related mortality and also propose that trauma sequelae in aging are linked to insulin signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings further suggest that SS-31 attenuates trauma-associated pathological changes.",2016,"Caterina Constantinou, Yiorgos Apidianakis, Nikolaos Psychogios, Valeria Righi, Michael N Mindrinos, Nadeem Khan, Harold M Swartz, Hazel H Szeto, Ronald G Tompkins, Laurence G Rahme, A Aria Tzika, Caterina Constantinou, Yiorgos Apidianakis, Nikolaos Psychogios, Valeria Righi, Michael N Mindrinos, Nadeem Khan, Harold M Swartz, Hazel H Szeto, Ronald G Tompkins, Laurence G Rahme, A Aria Tzika"
Accumulation of tetrahedral intermediates in cholinesterase catalysis: a secondary isotope effect study,21105647,10.1021/ja104496q,"In a previous communication, kinetic β-deuterium secondary isotope effects were reported that support a mechanism for substrate-activated turnover of acetylthiocholine by human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) wherein the accumulating reactant state is a tetrahedral intermediate ( Tormos , J. R. ; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005 , 127 , 14538 - 14539 ). In this contribution additional isotope effect experiments are described with acetyl-labeled acetylthiocholines (CL(3)COSCH(2)CH(2)N(+)Me(3); L = H or D) that also support accumulation of the tetrahedral intermediate in Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase (DmAChE) catalysis. In contrast to the aforementioned BuChE-catalyzed reaction, for this reaction the dependence of initial rates on substrate concentration is marked by pronounced substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations. Moreover, kinetic β-deuterium secondary isotope effects for turnover of acetylthiocholine depended on substrate concentration, and gave the following: (D3)k(cat)/K(m) = 0.95 ± 0.03, (D3)k(cat) = 1.12 ± 0.02 and (D3)βk(cat) = 0.97 ± 0.04. The inverse isotope effect on k(cat)/K(m) is consistent with conversion of the sp(2)-hybridized substrate carbonyl in the E + A reactant state into a quasi-tetrahedral transition state in the acylation stage of catalysis, whereas the markedly normal isotope effect on k(cat) is consistent with hybridization change from sp(3) toward sp(2) as the reactant state for deacylation is converted into the subsequent transition state. Transition states for Drosophila melanogaster AChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine were further characterized by measuring solvent isotope effects and determining proton inventories. These experiments indicated that the transition state for rate-determining decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by multiple protonic interactions. Finally, a simple model is proposed for the contribution that tetrahedral intermediate stabilization provides to the catalytic power of acetylcholinesterase.",2010,"Jose R Tormos, Kenneth L Wiley, Yi Wang, Didier Fournier, Patrick Masson, Florian Nachon, Daniel M Quinn, Jose R Tormos, Kenneth L Wiley, Yi Wang, Didier Fournier, Patrick Masson, Florian Nachon, Daniel M Quinn"
Genomic instability of I elements of Drosophila melanogaster in absence of dysgenic crosses,20957225,10.1371/journal.pone.0013142,"Retrotranspostion of I factors in the female germline of Drosophila melanogaster is responsible for the so called I-R hybrid dysgenesis, a phenomenon that produces a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities including reduced fertility, increased frequency of mutations and chromosome loss. Transposition of I factor depends on cellular conditions that are established in the oocytes of the reactive females and transmitted to their daughters. The so-called reactivity is a cellular state that may exhibit variable levels of expression and represents a permissive condition for I transposition at high levels. Defective I elements have been proposed to be the genetic determinants of reactivity and, through their differential expression, to modulate transposition of active copies in somatic and/or germ line cells. Recently, control of transposable element activity in the germ line has been found to depend on pi-RNAs, small repressive RNAs interacting with Piwi-family proteins and derived from larger transposable elements (TE)-derived primary transcripts. In particular, maternally transmitted I-element piRNAs originating from the 42AB region of polytene chromosomes were found to be involved in control of I element mobility. In the present work, we use a combination of cytological and molecular approaches to study the activity of I elements in three sublines of the inducer y; cn bw; sp isogenic strain and in dysgenic and non-dysgenic genetic backgrounds. Overall, the results of FISH and Southern blotting experiments clearly show that I elements are highly unstable in the Montpellier subline in the absence of classical dysgenic conditions. Such instability appears to be correlated to the amount of 5' and 3' I element transcripts detected by quantitative and real-time RT-PCR. The results of this study indicate that I elements can be highly active in the absence of a dysgenic crosses. Moreover, in the light of our results caution should be taken to assimilate the genomic annotation data on transposable elements to all y; cn bw sp sublines.",2010,"Roberta Moschetti, Patrizio Dimitri, Ruggiero Caizzi, Nikolaj Junakovic, Roberta Moschetti, Patrizio Dimitri, Ruggiero Caizzi, Nikolaj Junakovic"
"Efficiency of selection, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphism variation, is dependent on inbreeding rate in Drosophila melanogaster",19780974,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04366.x,"It is often hypothesized that slow inbreeding causes less inbreeding depression than fast inbreeding at the same absolute level of inbreeding. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include the more efficient purging of deleterious alleles and more efficient selection for heterozygote individuals during slow, when compared with fast, inbreeding. We studied the impact of inbreeding rate on the loss of heterozygosity and on morphological traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We analysed five noninbred control lines, 10 fast inbred lines and 10 slow inbred lines; the inbred lines all had an expected inbreeding coefficient of approximately 0.25. Forty single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA coding regions were genotyped, and we measured the size and shape of wings and counted the number of sternopleural bristles on the genotyped individuals. We found a significantly higher level of genetic variation in the slow inbred lines than in the fast inbred lines. This higher genetic variation was resulting from a large contribution from a few loci and a smaller effect from several loci. We attributed the increased heterozygosity in the slow inbred lines to the favouring of heterozygous individuals over homozygous individuals by natural selection, either by associative over-dominance or balancing selection, or a combination of both. Furthermore, we found a significant polynomial correlation between genetic variance and wing size and shape in the fast inbred lines. This was caused by a greater number of homozygous individuals among the fast inbred lines with small, narrow wings, which indicated inbreeding depression. Our results demonstrated that the same amount of inbreeding can have different effects on genetic variance depending on the inbreeding rate, with slow inbreeding leading to higher genetic variance than fast inbreeding. These results increase our understanding of the genetic basis of the common observation that slow inbred lines express less inbreeding depression than fast inbred lines. In addition, this has more general implications for the importance of selection in maintaining genetic variation.",2009,"Ditte Demontis, Cino Pertoldi, Volker Loeschcke, Karina Mikkelsen, Tomas Axelsson, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen, Ditte Demontis, Cino Pertoldi, Volker Loeschcke, Karina Mikkelsen, Tomas Axelsson, Torsten Nygaard Kristensen"
"yellow0, a marker for low body weight in Drosophila melanogaster",19641873,10.1007/s11427-009-0075-7,"Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is an important modern breeding technique, but it has been found that the effect of the markers for quantitative trait loci (QTL) is inconsistent, leading in some cases to MAS failure and raising doubts about its effectiveness. Here the model organism Drosophila melanogaster was employed to study whether an effective marker could be found and applied to MAS. We crossed the stock carrying the y (0) marker (a recessive mutation allele of the yellow gene on the X chromosome) with three other stocks carrying corresponding wild-type markers in an F2 design, and found that the y (0) marker was in significant association with low body weight (P<0.001). This association was consistent across different backgrounds and the marker effects in female and male were approximately 0.95 sigma (P) (phenotypic standard deviation) and 0.68 sigma (P), respectively. We next introgressed a fragment via the y (0) marker into a wild stock background over 20 generations of marker-assisted introgression (MAI), and constructed the introgression stock y (0)(OR)20 in which body weight decreased by 13% and 7%, in female and male, respectively, compared to the wild stock (P<0.0001). This indicated that there must be a single QTL for low body weight that is tightly linked to the y (0) marker. We then shortened the introgressed fragment to less than 1.5 cM by a deeper MAI using the y (0) marker and the white marker. This narrower fragment also resulted in a similar decrease in body weight to that induced by y (0)(OR)20, indicating that the QTL for low body weight is located within this less-than-1.5 cM interval. Molecular characteristics of the y (0) marker by PCR amplification and Southern blotting revealed that yellow gene was deficient in the y (0) stock, leading to disappearance of melanin from the cuticle and probably influencing the developmental process. The above results confirmed the existence of effective QTL markers applicable to MAS breeding schemes, and their potential application in breeding new stocks.",2009,"XinHai Li, XueMei Deng, XinHai Li, XueMei Deng"
Analytical approach for the extraction of recombinant membrane viral glycoprotein from stably transfected Drosophila melanogaster cells,18064610,10.1002/biot.200700179,"Parameters for storage, lysis and concentration of Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2AcRVGP) cells expressing the recombinant rabies virus glycoprotein (RVGP) were studied with regard to RVGP quantification by ELISA, for productivity evaluation and future purification. Lysis buffers were formulated with Tris, NaCl, glycerol, EDTA, KCl, Na(2)PO(4), MgCl(2), PMSF and NP-40 or CHAPS. S2AcRVGP cells (10(7) cells at the exponential growth phase) were frozen at -20 degrees C as a dry pellet, suspended in buffer (B) formulations or after treatment with lysis buffer (LB) formulations. They were then thawed as cell pellets or with B formulations or PBS at 4 degrees C or at room temperature and then lysed with LB formulations. For RVGP quantification by ELISA, a protocol was chosen of cell preparation including cell freezing as dry pellet, cell thawing at 4 degrees C with B4 (Tris, NaCl, MgCl(2), PMSF) and cell lysis with the LB4 (B4 + NP-40) since it fulfilled requirements of high RVGP detection, and was easily performed with mixtures freezing quickly, and a cost-saving LB formulation could be used. Using these established conditions, we examined the optimal cell concentration for RVGP quantification by ELISA. Results showed that an increase in the RVGP detection (from 62.5 to 1083 ng/10(7) cells) paralleled a decrease in the cell number (3 x 10(7) - 10(5) cells) used. The NP-40 concentration present in the LB4 was further investigated as a function of the cell number used for sample preparation. Previous results were confirmed indicating that higher NP-40 concentrations led to a decreased detection of RVGP. Altogether our data clearly pointed out the crucial effects of cell freeze, thaw, lysis and concentration on immune detection of recombinant membrane glycoproteins and can be useful as a guideline for sample preparation for this purpose.",2008,"Renato M Astray, Elisabeth Augusto, Adriana Y Yokomizo, Carlos A Pereira, Renato M Astray, Elisabeth Augusto, Adriana Y Yokomizo, Carlos A Pereira"
Phenotypic plasticity of body size in a temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster: when the temperature-size rule does not apply,16809835,10.1007/BF02728965,"A natural population of Drosophila melanogaster in southern France was sampled in three different years and 10 isofemale lines were investigated from each sample. Two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, were measured and the wing/thorax ratio was also calculated. Phenotypic plasticity was analysed after development at seven different constant temperatures, ranging from 12 degrees C to 31 degrees C. The three year samples exhibited similar reaction norms, suggesting a stable genetic architecture in the natural population. The whole sample (30 lines) was used to determine precisely the shape of each reaction norm, using a derivative analysis. The practical conclusion was that polynomial adjustments could be used in all cases, but with different degrees: linear for the wing/thorax ratio, quadratic for thorax length, and cubic for wing length. Both wing and thorax length exhibited concave reaction norms, with a maximum within the viable thermal range. The temperatures of the maxima were, however, quite different, around 15 degrees C for the wing and 19.5 degrees C for the thorax. Assuming that thorax length is a better estimate of body size, it is not possible to state that increasing the temperature results in monotonically decreasing size (the temperature-size rule), although this is often seen to be the case for genetic variations in latitudinal clines. The variability of the traits was investigated at two levels-within and between lines-and expressed as a coefficient of variation. The within-line (environmental) variability revealed a regular, quadratic convex reaction norm for the three traits, with a minimum around 21 degrees C. This temperature of minimum variability may be considered as a physiological optimum, while extreme temperatures are stressful. The between-line (genetic) variability could also be adjusted to quadratic polynomials, but the curvature parameters were not significant. Our results show that the mean values of the traits and their variance are both plastic, but react in different ways along a temperature gradient. Extreme low or high temperatures decrease the size but increase the variability. These effects may be considered as a functional response to environmental stress.",2006,"Jean R David, Hélène Legout, Brigitte Moreteau, Jean R David, Hélène Legout, Brigitte Moreteau"
Genotype-specific responses of fluctuating asymmetry and of preadult survival to the effects of lead and temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster,14554005,10.1016/s0269-7491(03)00238-0,"Although fluctuating asymmetry (FA) increases with exposure to certain types of environmental stressors such as temperature extremes, relatively little is known about the effects of interaction (e.g., synergism) between known sources of environmental stress on FA. Knowledge of such interaction effects, and of the magnitude of genotype-by-environment interaction, are of fundamental importance toward predicting the usefulness of FA as a bioindicator of environmental pollution. We tested for synergistic effects on FA between elevated temperature and exposure to lead, and examined FA responses simultaneously in four genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster known to differ in their degree of developmental instability, and presumably in their buffering capacity. In the absence of heavy metal, bristle FA increased with temperature, but in the presence of lead, FA at high temperature (30 (degrees)C) was reduced to levels similar, or below, that at lower temperature (25 (degrees)C). This temperature by lead interaction was statistically significant, but paradoxical in that the disruptive effects of temperature appeared to be attenuated in the presence of the heavy metal. In no case was there a significant effect of lead on bristle FAs, despite documented assimilation of heavy metal by flies, and in no case was the genotype by environment interaction significant. Whereas lead treatment did not influence survival, survival was reduced at the high temperature, but significantly so only in one genetic strain (Oregon-R). There was no relationship between survival and FA across stress treatments within lines. Thus, any disproportionate stress-induced mortality in developmentally unstable classes (developmental selection) was unlikely to bias the FA results. Our results underscore the need for independent replication of significant findings before FA-based biomonitoring can be responsibly and effectively implemented. The results call for caution in using FA as a biomarker of stress, because stress factors may interact in complex and unpredictable ways, which could result in erroneous conclusions about real levels of stress present in field populations, under the unduly simplistic assumption that stress factors will act additively to increase FA.",2004,"Michal Polak, David E Kroeger, Iain L Cartwright, Claudia Ponce deLeon, Michal Polak, David E Kroeger, Iain L Cartwright, Claudia Ponce deLeon"
Effects of pharmacological agents upon a transgenic model of Parkinson's disease in Drosophila melanogaster,11752102,10.1124/jpet.300.1.91,"The human gene that codes for the protein alpha-synuclein has been transferred into the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The transgenic flies recapitulate some of the essential features of Parkinson's disease. These include the degeneration of certain dopaminergic neurons in the brain accompanied by the appearance of age-dependent abnormalities in locomotor activity. In the present study, we tested the locomotor response of these transgenic flies to prototypes of the major classes of drugs currently used to treat this disorder. A time course study was first conducted to determine when impaired locomotor activity appeared relative to normal ""wild-type"" flies. A climbing or negative geotaxis assay measuring the ability of the organisms to climb up the walls of a plastic vial was used. Based on the results obtained, normal and transgenic flies were treated with each of the drugs in their food for 13 days and then assayed. The activity of transgenic flies treated with L-DOPA was restored to normal. Similarly, the dopamine agonists pergolide, bromocriptine, and 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy- 1-phenyl-1H-3-benzazepine (SK&F 38393) were substantially effective. Atropine, the prototypical muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, was also effective but to a lesser extent than the other antiparkinson compounds. p-Chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, was without beneficial effect as was alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. This behavioral study further demonstrates the utility of this model in studying Parkinson's disease and reinforces the concept that inhibition of the action of alpha-synuclein may be useful in its treatment as may dopamine D(1) receptor agonists.",2002,"Robert G Pendleton, Feroz Parvez, Marwa Sayed, Ralph Hillman, Robert G Pendleton, Feroz Parvez, Marwa Sayed, Ralph Hillman"
The Acp26Aa seminal fluid protein is a modulator of early egg hatchability in Drosophila melanogaster,11506676,10.1098/rspb.2001.1684,"Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland proteins (Acps) that are transferred in the ejaculate with sperm mediate post-mating competition for fertilizations between males. The actions of Acps include effects on oviposition and ovulation, receptivity and sperm storage. Two Acps that modulate egg production are Acp26Aa (ovulin) and Acp70A (the sex peptide). Acp26Aa acts specifically on the process of ovulation (the release of mature eggs from the ovaries), which is initiated 1.5 h after mating. In contrast, sperm storage can take as long as 6-9 h to complete. Initial ovulations after matings by virgin females will therefore occur before all sperm are fully stored and the extra eggs initially laid as a result of Acp26Aa transfer are expected to be inefficiently fertilized. Acp26Aa-mediated release of existing eggs should not cause a significant energetic cost or lead to a decrease in female lifespan assuming, as seems likely, that the energetic cost of egg laying comes from de novo egg synthesis (oogenesis) rather than from ovulation. We tested these predictions using Acp26Aa(1) mutant males that lack Acp26Aa but are normal for other Acps and Acp26Aa(2) males that transfer a truncated but fully functional Acp26Aa protein. Females mating with Acp26Aa(2) (truncation) males that received functional Acp26Aa produced significantly more eggs following their first matings than did mates of Acp26Aa(1) (null) males. However, as predicted above, these extra eggs, which were laid as a result of Acp26Aa transfer to virgin females, showed significantly lower egg hatchability. Control experiments indicated that this lower hatchability was due to lower rates of fertilization at early post-mating times. There was no drop in egg hatchability in subsequent non-virgin matings. In addition, as predicted above, females that did or did not receive Acp26Aa did not differ in survival, lifetime fecundity or lifetime progeny, indicating that Acp26Aa transfer does not represent a significant energetic cost for females and does not contribute to the survival cost of mating. Acp26Aa appears to remove a block to oogenesis by causing the clearing out of existing mature eggs and, thus, indirectly allowing oogenesis to be initiated immediately after mating. The results show that subtle processes coordinate the stimulation of egg production and sperm storage in mating pairs.",2001,"T Chapman, L A Herndon, Y Heifetz, L Partridge, M F Wolfner, T Chapman, L A Herndon, Y Heifetz, L Partridge, M F Wolfner"
Developmental regulation and complex organization of the promoter of the non-coding hsr(omega) gene of Drosophila melanogaster,11255511,10.1007/BF02708978,"The nucleus-limited large non-coding hsr(omega)-n RNA product of the 93D or the hsr(omega) gene of Drosophila melanogaster binds to a variety of RNA-binding proteins involved in nuclear RNA processing. We examined the developmental and heat shock induced expression of this gene by in situ hybridization of nonradioactively labelled riboprobe to cellular transcripts in intact embryos, larval and adult somatic tissues of wild type and an enhancer-trap line carrying the hsr(omega) 05241 allele due to insertion of a P-LacZ-rosy+ transposon at -130 bp position of the hsr(omega) promoter. We also examined LacZ expression in the enhancer-trap line and in two transgenic lines carrying different lengths of the hsr(omega) promoter upstream of the LacZ reporter. The hsr(omega) gene is expressed widely at all developmental stages; in later embryonic stages, its expression in the developing central nervous system was prominent. In spite of insertion of a big transposon in the promoter, expression of the hsr(omega) 05241 allele in the enhancer-trap line, as revealed by in situ hybridization to hsr(omega) transcripts in cells, was similar to that of the wild type allele in all the embryonic, larval and adult somatic tissues examined. Expression of the LacZ gene in this enhancer-trap line was similar to that of the hsr(omega) RNA in all diploid cell types in embryos and larvae but in the polytene cells, the LacZ gene did not express at all, neither during normal development nor after heat shock. Comparison of the expression patterns of hsr(omega) gene and those of the LacZ reporter gene under its various promoter regions in the enhancer-trap and transgenic lines revealed a complex pattern of regulation, which seems to be essential for its dynamically varying expression in diverse cell types.",2001,"S C Lakhotia, T K Rajendra, K V Prasanth, S C Lakhotia, T K Rajendra, K V Prasanth"
Comparative study on germ cell mutation induced by urethane (ethyl carbamate) gas and X-rays in Drosophila melanogaster,9247602,10.1111/j.1349-7006.1997.tb00404.x,"Although its mutagenicity has not been confirmed in mouse germ cells, urethane (ethyl carbamate) gas induces a significant increase of X-linked recessive lethal mutations in the germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster. The mutation frequency increased as the exposure time was changed from 3.5 to 5.5 h. Mutations were also induced by X-rays (20 to 40 Gy) and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) (0.06 to 0.10%). However, no significant increase of chromosomal changes (partial loss of the Y chromosome, total loss of X or Y, and translocations) was produced by urethane, although these were readily induced by X-rays. There were large and significant increase in chromosomal changes caused by X-rays (20 Gy) compared to urethane (5.5 h) or MNU (0.06%). In contrast, there were no substantial differences among these three treatments as regards recessive lethal mutations. Urethane-induced DNA lesions detected as recessive lethals appear to be intragenic mutations. Complementation analysis with 15 reference single-site loci (cistrons) in the zeste-white region of the X chromosome revealed that 29 of 723 urethane-induced recessive lethals were located in the zeste-white region and all were restricted to a single locus. However, among 28 of 890 X-ray-induced lethals, 2 were non-complementary to 2 or 3 adjacent loci, indicating deletions encompassing 2 or 3 loci. In addition, 3 of these lethal chromosomes included mutations outside the zeste-white region. Another difference between urethane and X-rays was in the distribution of mutation sites.

Tissue-specific expression of phospholipase C encoded by the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster,8340420,,"Mutations in the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster severely affect the light-evoked photoreceptor potential with strong mutations rendering the fly blind. Molecular cloning of the norpA gene revealed that it encodes phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which enzymes play a pivotal role in one of the largest classes of signaling pathways known. We have used Northern analysis, Western blots, phospholipase C activity assays, and immunohistochemical staining of tissues to examine the tissue-specific expression of the norpA gene and found that it is expressed in a variety of tissues besides the eye. Hybridization of norpA cRNA probe to blots of poly(A+) RNA reveals that the gene encodes at least four transcripts: a 7.5-kilobase (kb) transcript that is expressed in eye and 6.5-, 5.5-, and 5.0-kb transcripts that are expressed in adult body or early stages of development. Antiserum generated against the major gene product of norpA recognizes a 130-kDa protein that is abundant in eyes but severely reduced or absent in norpA mutants, a result which is consistent with previous conclusions that the norpA gene encodes an essential component of the visual system. However, the norpA antiserum also recognizes a 130-kDa protein in adult legs, thorax, and male abdomen, but not female abdomen. These localizations are supported by results of phospholipase C activity assays which show that the norpA mutation reduces phospholipase C activity in each of the tissues in which norpA protein can be detected. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections with the norpA antiserum demonstrates that the norpA protein is abundant in the retina and ocelli and is present to a lesser extent in the brain and thoracic nervous system. Since some of the above mentioned tissues that express norpA (such as thorax, legs, and abdomen) have no known photoreceptor tissue, we conclude that the norpA gene product is also likely to have a role in signaling pathways other than phototransduction.",1993,"L Zhu, R R McKay, R D Shortridge, L Zhu, R R McKay, R D Shortridge"
Genetic and environmental effects on the expression of peptidases and larval viability in Drosophila melanogaster,1628808,,"The peptidase system in Drosophila melanogaster, consisting of dipeptidase-A, dipeptidase-B, dipeptidase-C and the leucine aminopeptidases, was used as a model to study the adaptive significance of enzyme activity variation. The involvement of the peptidases in osmoregulation has been suggested from the ubiquitous distribution of peptidase activities in nearly all tissues and the high concentration of amino acids and oligopeptides in the hemolymph. Under this hypothesis, larvae counteract increases in environmental osmotic stress by hydrolyzing peptides into amino acids both intra- and extracellularly to increase physiological osmotic concentration. The expression of the peptidases was studied by assaying for peptidase activities in third instar larvae of isogenic lines, which were reared under increasing levels of environmental osmotic stress using either D-mannitol or NaCl. Second and third chromosome substitution isogenic lines were used to assess the relative contribution of regulatory and structural genes in enzyme activity variation. Results indicate that: (1) genetic variation exists for peptidase activities, (2) the effect of osmotic stress is highly variable among peptidases, (3) changes in peptidase activities in response to osmotic stress depend on both genetic background and osmotic effector and (4) peptidase activities are correlated with each other, but these phenotypic correlations depend on genetic background, osmotic effector, and level of osmotic stress. Osmotic concentration in the larval hemolymph is correlated with leucine aminopeptidase activity, but changes in hemolymph osmotic concentration in response to environmental osmotic stress depend on the osmotic effector in the environment. Although these findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors contribute significantly toward the expression of enzymes with similar functions, a relative larval viability study of genotypes that differed significantly in dipeptidase-B (DIP-B) activity revealed that low DIP-B activity did not confer any measurable reduction in larval viability under increasing levels of environmental osmotic stress. These negative results suggest that, either DIP-B does not play a major role in osmoregulation or differential osmoregulation is not related to egg to adult viability in these tests.",1992,"K Hiraizumi, P A Tavormina, K D Mathes, K Hiraizumi, P A Tavormina, K D Mathes"
Male sexual signaling is defective in mutants of the apterous gene of Drosophila melanogaster,1503549,10.1007/BF01066616,"The apterous (ap) gene of Drosophila melanogaster exhibits extreme pleiotrophy: its functioning is essential for life, normal wing structure, juvenile hormone production, female fertility, and normal development of female sexual receptivity. Four mutant ap alleles (ap4, ap56f, apc, and apblt) were characterized for three additional phenotypes: male mating success, courtship behavior, and immature male sex appeal (the ability of males to stimulate homosexual courtship). Mating success with mature wild-type virgin females is reduced in males mutant for the ap gene, the extreme case being ap4/ap4 males, which are behaviorally sterile. In ap mutants, nonwing courtship elements are qualitatively like those of ap+/ap+ males. However, the mean rate of nonwing courtship directed toward virgin wild-type females (i.e., the mean temporal frequency of these displays) is reduced in males homozygous for ap4, ap56f, or apc alleles. In contrast, the apblt allele makes for wild-type rates of nonwing courtship. Immature male sex appeal persists for at least 3 days in males homozygous for apc and, to a lesser extent, in ap56f or ap4 homozygotes; apblt/apblt and wild-type males lose immature male sex appeal after 1 day. All three male phenotypes map to the ap locus, which is therefore essential for the development of normal levels of male courtship and male mating success and for the timely loss of immature male sex appeal. For each phenotype, ap+ is dominant to ap alleles making for behavioral abnormalities, with a single exception (for rate of nonwing courtship, ap+/apc was low). For mating success and frequency of nonwing courtship, each allele pair exhibits at least partial complementation, except for ap4 and ap56f, which fail to complement. For immature male sex appeal, apc, ap4, and ap56f fall into the same complementation group. Juvenile hormone production is not correlated with effects on male reproductive behavior.",1992,"J Ringo, R Werczberger, D Segal, J Ringo, R Werczberger, D Segal"
Ultrastructure of the ocellar visual system in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster,2500507,10.3109/01677068909066203,"Between the two compound eyes on the vertex on the adult head are the three simple eyes, ocelli.

In wild type flies, the cornea consists of about 45 lamellae. It has corneal nipples distally and is underlaid with a monolayer of corneagenous cells. Retinula cells have open rhabdomeres of about 2 microns (diameter) x 7 microns (length). Rhabdomeres extend to the distal extent of the cell and do not have caps. Microvilli have a rodlet within. Retinula cells are joined by belt desmosomes on the lateral borders. Eye color pigment granules are housed within the retinula cells of normal flies, not in accessory cells. The granules do not migrate in response to light. No screening pigment granules exist in the white mutant. Each ocellus has about 80 retinula cells whose axons project to corresponding ganglia from which 4 giant afferent interneurons (per ganglion) project to the brain. receptor terminals are invested with capitate projections from glia. Receptors synapse onto dyads of follower cells, usually interneuron processes, at sites of T shaped presynaptic ribbons. These ""T bars"" are surrounded by indistinct flattened vesicles. Interneurons make feed back synapses onto receptor terminals at T bars clustered with distinct round vesicles. Three mutants with abnormal ocelli were investigated. The none mutant has unusual compound eye and ocellar corneas. The compound eye is devoid of differentiated photoreceptors but some axons from undifferentiated cells from synapses. No receptors were found in the ocelli of none. The oc mutant has no ocelli, although sometimes an ocellar cornea like that of none is seen; the compound eye is normal. The rdo mutant is also specific to ocelli with smaller ocelli having half the wild type allotment of receptor cells; the number of giant afferents is unaffected. Mutants best known for their compound eye defects were examined. The norpA mutant loses its ocellar rhabdomeres with age but has normal feed forward and feed back synapses. This normal synaptology prevails despite the electrophysiological defects in norpA ocelli reported earlier. The rdgABS12 mutant has poorly formed ocellar receptors which show some degeneration with age but synapses survive. The trp. rdgBKS222 and rgdAPC47 mutants are essentially normal with respect to structure and survival of ocellar receptors and synapses.",1989,"W S Stark, R Sapp, S D Carlson, W S Stark, R Sapp, S D Carlson"
Effects of a chromosome-3 mutator gene on radiation-induced mutability in Drosophila melanogaster females,6806650,10.1016/0027-5107(82)90218-4,"A series of X-irradiation experiments was carried out using Drosophila melanogaster females homozygous for a third chromosome mutator gene and females which had a similar genetic background except that the mutator-bearing third chromosomes were substituted by normal wild-type chromosomes. The mutator females had been previously shown by Gold and Green to manifest a higher level of radiation-induced mutability (as measured by the X-ray-induction of sex-linked recessive lethals) in their pre-meiotic germ cells compared to normal females at an exposure of 100 R. In the presence work, the sensitivity of the pre-meiotic germ cells of mutator and normal females to the X-ray induction (2000 R) of sex-linked recessive lethals was studied. In addition, experiments were conducted to examine the sensitivity of the immature (stage 7; prophase I of meiosis) oocytes of both kinds of females to the induction of dominant lethals, X-linked recessive lethals and X-chromosome losses. The result show that in pre-meiotic germ cells, the frequencies of radiation-induced recessive lethals are similar in both kinds of females. However, the proportion of these mutations that occur in clusters of size 3 and higher, is higher in mutator than in normal females. In stage-7 oocytes, the frequencies of radiation-induced dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals were similar in both kinds of females. The X-loss frequencies however, were consistently higher in mutator females although statistical significance was obtained only at higher exposures (3000 and 3750 R) and not at lower ones (750-2250 R). Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the present results and those of Gold and Green with respect to pre-meiotic germ cells are discussed.",1982,"K Sankaranarayanan, K Sankaranarayanan"
Developmental environment mediates male seminal protein investment in Drosophila melanogaster,27546947,10.1111/1365-2435.12515,"Males of many species fine-tune their ejaculates in response to sperm competition risk. Resource availability and the number of competitors during development can also strongly influence sperm production. However, despite the key role of seminal proteins in mediating reproductive processes, it is unclear whether seminal protein investment is dependent on the developmental environment.We manipulated the developmental environment of Drosophila melanogaster by rearing flies at low and high density. As expected, this resulted in large and small (i.e. high and low condition) adult phenotypes, respectively.As predicted, large males produced more of two key seminal proteins, sex peptide (SP) and ovulin, and were more successful at obtaining matings with both virgin and previously mated females. However, there was only a weak and non-significant trend for large males to transfer more absolute quantities of SP at mating, and thus, small males ejaculated proportionally more of their stored accessory gland SP resources.Males transferred more receptivity-inhibiting SP to large females. Despite this, large females remated more quickly than small females and thus responded to their developmental environment over and above the quantity of SP they received.The results are consistent with two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. First, flies might respond to condition-dependent reproductive opportunities, with (i) small males investing heavily in ejaculates when mating opportunities arise and large males strategically partitioning SP resources and (ii) small females remating at reduced rates because they have higher mating costs or need to replenish sperm less often.Second, flies may be primed by their larval environment to deal with similar adult population densities, with (i) males perceiving high density as signalling increased competition, leading small males to invest proportionally more SP resources at mating and (ii) females perceiving high density as signalling abundant potential mates, leading to a higher sexual receptivity threshold.Thus, by influencing the mating frequencies of both sexes, as well as the quantity of seminal proteins produced by males and received by females, the developmental environment is likely to have far-reaching and sex-specific consequences for sexual selection and sexual conflict.",2016,"Stuart Wigby, Jennifer C Perry, Yon-Hee Kim, Laura K Sirot, Stuart Wigby, Jennifer C Perry, Yon-Hee Kim, Laura K Sirot"
The ontogeny and evolution of sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster,24526011,10.1093/molbev/msu072,"Sexually dimorphic phenotypes are thought to largely result from sex differences in gene expression, and genes with sex-biased expression have been well characterized in adults of many species. Although most sexual dimorphisms manifest in adults, many result from sex-specific developmental trajectories, implying that juveniles may exhibit significant levels of sex-biased expression. However, it is unclear how much sex-biased expression occurs before reproductive maturity and whether preadult sex-biased genes should exhibit the same evolutionary dynamics observed for adult sex-biased genes. In order to understand the continuity, or lack thereof, and evolutionary dynamics of sex-biased expression throughout the life cycle, we examined sex-biased genes in pre-gonad tissue of two preadult stages and compared them with the adult gonad of Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the majority of the genome is sex-biased at some point in the life cycle, with some genes exhibiting conserved sex-biased expression and others displaying stage-specific sex bias. Our results also reveal a far more complex pattern of evolution for sex-biased genes throughout development. The most rapid evolutionary divergence occurred in genes expressed only in larvae within each sex, compared with continuously expressed genes. In females-but not males-this pattern appeared to be due to relaxed purifying selection in larva-limited genes. Furthermore, genes that retained male bias throughout life evolved more rapidly than stage-specific male-biased genes, due to stronger purifying selection in stage-specific genes. However, female-biased genes that were specific to larvae evolved most rapidly, a pattern that could not be definitively attributed to differences in adaptive evolution or purifying selection, suggesting that pleiotropic constraints on protein-coding sequences can arise when genes are broadly expressed across developmental stages. These results indicate that the signature of sex-specific selection can be detected well before reproductive maturity and is strongest during development.",2014,"Jennifer C Perry, Peter W Harrison, Judith E Mank, Jennifer C Perry, Peter W Harrison, Judith E Mank"
Specific amino acids affecting Drosophila melanogaster prophenoloxidase activity in vitro,22579944,10.1016/j.dci.2012.04.007,"Insect prophenoloxidase (PPO) is a key enzyme that induces melanization around invading pathogens and at wounds to prevent further infection. Drosophila melanogaster has three PPO genes which have different biochemical properties following over-expression in S2 cells. As shown by automatic melanization of S2 cells, recombinant PPO3 (rPPO3) became activated upon Cu(2+) addition (Cu(2+)-aided cells melanization without ethanol activation and substrate addition: +Cu(2+); -DOPA, -Ethanol). The exact reasons for this phenomenon are still unknown. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis and over-expression methods, we found that the place holder, two independent amino acids (equal to Manduca sexta amino acid residues: F218 and S393 in MsPPO1, F224 and E395 in MsPPO2) in the active site pocket and a missing fragment (similar to (565)RPGDPGT(571) in MsPPO1 and (571)QGSDPRR(577) in MsPPO2) at the C-terminus of PPO3, affect rPPO3-S2 cells Cu(2+)-aided auto-melanization. Some mutations nearly rescued rPPO3 Cu(2+)-aided auto-activation, which suggests that the auto-activation of wild type rPPO3 was not due to cleavage by serine proteases. We also found that the corresponding amino acids in the active site pocket have similar effect on PPO1 as on PPO3. PPO1 staining activity (Cu(2+) added or not during PPO transfection; cells melanized after ethanol activation and substrate addition: ±Cu(2+); +DOPA, +Ethanol) has a positive relationship with the active site pocket size as does rPPO3. The fragment of rPPO1 corresponding to the one missing from the C-terminus of PPO3 has no influence on rPPO1 staining activity after it is deleted. However, the staining activities of rPPO2 mutants decreased after deletion of those corresponding amino acid sequences. When the corresponding fragments from PPO1 or PPO2 were inserted into PPO3, the mutant rPPO3 had no influence on staining activity, but had a significantly lowered Cu(2+)-aided auto-activation. Thus, we found that some amino acids are important for rPPO3 Cu(2+)-aided auto-activation as well as PPO staining activity in vitro.",2012,"Yang Chen, Fei Liu, Bing Yang, Anrui Lu, Shiwei Wang, Jingfang Wang, Qing-Zhi Ling, Xuan Li, Brenda T Beerntsen, Erjun Ling, Yang Chen, Fei Liu, Bing Yang, Anrui Lu, Shiwei Wang, Jingfang Wang, Qing-Zhi Ling, Xuan Li, Brenda T Beerntsen, Erjun Ling"
Antitumor effects of oncolytic adenovirus armed with Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase in colorectal cancer,22294034,10.3892/or.2012.1665,"Drosophila melanogaster multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK) was applied as a cancer gene therapeutic approach. To improve the antitumor effect of Dm-dNK, a novel suicide gene system based on an oncolytic adenovirus vector was developed to produce therapeutic effects towards colorectal cancer cells. We constructed an oncolytic adenoviral vector (ZD55), which was designed by deletion of the E1B-55 kDa gene for selective replication in tumor cells, containing suicide gene (Dm-dNK) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. We analysed the expression and activity of Dm-dNK in colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116 and SW620) via reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and enzyme assay. We assessed selective cytotoxic effects of Dm-dNK with the presence of the analogs (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU), difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) or 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylthymine (ara-T) by MTT and FACS; the variation of oncolytic adenovirus was detected by titer assay and western blot analysis. Our data showed that ZD55-Dm-dNK mediated high expression of Dm-dNK in HCT-116 and SW620 cancer cell lines and low levels of expression in WI-38 and MRC-5 normal cells, strong cytotoxicity was observed only in tumor cells after ZD55-Dm-dNK infection combined with nucleoside analogs (NA). When ZD55-Dm-dNK was combined with BVDU or dFdC, it produced a synergistic inhibitive effect of adenovirus replication while maintaining specific cancer cell killing activity. The results suggest that the novel oncolytic virus ZD55-Dm-dNK, in combination with NA, has potential as an efficient selective antitumoral agent and may produce synergistic effects in safe control of adenovirus, which is a new promising therapeutic for colorectal cancer.",2012,"Shuai Ma, Wenzhi Qu, Liang Mao, Zhi Zhu, Lanling Jia, Lei Zhao, Xinyu Zheng, Shuai Ma, Wenzhi Qu, Liang Mao, Zhi Zhu, Lanling Jia, Lei Zhao, Xinyu Zheng"
Rapid cold-hardening protects Drosophila melanogaster from cold-induced apoptosis,17245639,10.1007/s10495-006-0048-2,"The rapid cold-hardening (RCH) response increases the cold tolerance of insects by protecting against non-freezing, cold-shock injury. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays important roles in development and the elimination of sub-lethally damaged cells. Our objectives were to determine whether apoptosis plays a role in cold-shock injury and, if so, whether the RCH response protects against cold-induced apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster. The present study confirmed that RCH increased the cold tolerance of the adults at the organismal level. No flies in the cold-shocked group survived direct exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h, whereas significantly more flies in the RCH group survived exposure to 7 degrees C for 2 h after a 2-h exposure to 5 degrees C. We used a TUNEL assay to detect and quantify apoptotic cell death in five groups of flies including control, cold-shocked, RCH, heat-shocked (37.5 degrees C, 30 min), and frozen (20 degrees C, 24 h) and found that apoptosis was induced by cold shock, heat shock, and freezing. The RCH treatment significantly improved cell viability by 38% compared to the cold-shocked group. Cold shock-induced DNA fragmentation shown by electrophoresis provided further evidence for apoptosis. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed an RCH-specific protein band with molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa. Western-blotting revealed three proteins that play key roles in the apoptotic pathway: caspase-9-like (apoptotic initiator), caspase-3-like (apoptotic executioner) and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic protein). Consequently, the results of this study support the hypothesis that the RCH response protects against cold-shock-induced apoptosis.",2007,"Shu-Xia Yi, Clifford W Moore, Richard E Lee Jr, Shu-Xia Yi, Clifford W Moore, Richard E Lee Jr"
Molecular population genetics of the beta-esterase gene cluster of Drosophila melanogaster,15133190,10.1007/BF02715813,"We have investigated nucleotide polymorphism at the beta-esterase gene cluster including the Est-6 gene and psiEst-6 putative pseudogene in four samples of Drosophila melanogaster derived from natural populations of southern Africa (Zimbabwe), Europe (Spain), North America (USA: California), and South America (Venezuela). A complex haplotype structure is revealed in both Est-6 and psiEst-6. Total nucleotide diversity is twice in psiEst-6 as in Est-6; diversity is higher in the African sample than in the non-African ones. Strong linkage disequilibrium occurs within the beta-esterase gene cluster in non-African samples, but not in the African one. Intragenic gene conversion events are detected within Est-6 and, to a much greater extent, within psiEst-6; intergenic gene conversion events are rare. Tests of neutrality with recombination are significant for the beta-esterase gene cluster in the non-African samples but not significant in the African one. We suggest that the demographic history (bottleneck and admixture of genetically differentiated populations) is the major factor shaping the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in the beta-esterase gene cluster. However there are some 'footprints' of directional and balancing selection shaping specific distribution of nucleotide polymorphism within the cluster. Intergenic epistatic selection between Est-6 and psiEst-6 may play an important role in the evolution of the beta-esterase gene cluster preserving the putative pseudogene from degenerative destruction and reflecting possible functional interaction between the functional gene and the putative pseudogene. Est-6 and psiEst-6 may represent an indivisible intergenic complex ('intergene') in which each single component (Est-6 or psiEst-6) cannot separately carry out the full functional role.",2003,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala"
Female germ cell mutagenicity of model chemicals in Drosophila melanogaster: mechanistic information and analysis of repair systems,14698417,10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2003.09.013,"In spite of differences between female and male germ cells, and although both of them contribute to the gene pool of future generations, most germ cell mutagenicity studies in higher eukaryotes have been carried out on males. To study the response of female germ cells to mutagen/carcinogen exposure, the mutagenicity of two model chemicals like diethyl sulfate (DES) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), and the monofunctional methylating chemotherapeutic drug streptozotocin (STZ), has been analysed on repair efficient females of Drosophila melanogaster. Results previously obtained with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), another model chemical, have also been included in the analysis. The activity of bypass tolerance mechanism (BTM; represented by the mus308 locus) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) on the removal of oxygen and nitrogen ethylations was studied by determining DES mutagenicity in NER deficient females, comparing it with existing results for ENU, and by analysing both chemicals on BTM deficient females. Results indicate that (1) all chemicals are mutagenic on repair efficient females; (2) a measure of mutagenic activity ranked from the lowest DES to STZ, HMPA, and ENU as the highest. This order correlates with the repair of the respectively induced DNA damages, and with the mutagenic and carcinogenic potency of these compounds, considering the toxicity of cross-linking agents; (3) NER efficiently repairs nitrogen ethylation damage and seems to contribute to the processing of oxygen damage in female germ cells; and (4) BTM is involved on the processing of oxygen ethylation damage, whereas the results on nitrogen ethylation are not clear. Finally, these results indicate that differences between male and female germ cells affect the response to chemical exposure, and therefore demonstrate the necessity of analysing also female cells in germinal mutagenicity studies. In addition, these studies can provide important mechanistic information about germ cell chemical mutagenesis, and even when the analysis of oogonia is not possible, since all female germ cells are pre-meiotic, studies of oocytes could be a model for pre-meiotic cells.",2004,"Julia Hernando, Lidia Alvarez, José A Ferreiro, Ignacio Sancho, Miguel A Comendador, L María Sierra, Julia Hernando, Lidia Alvarez, José A Ferreiro, Ignacio Sancho, Miguel A Comendador, L María Sierra"
Screening of environmental contaminants for ecdysteroid agonist and antagonist activity using the Drosophila melanogaster B(II) cell in vitro assay,11521832,10.1897/1551-5028(2001)020<2038:soecfe>2.0.co;2,"The B(II) bioassay was developed as a rapid and reliable tool for detecting potential insect growth regulators acting as ecdysteroid receptor (ant)agonists. Based on an ecdysteroid-responsive cell line from Drosophila melanogaster, this microplate assay is ideally suited to the evaluation of environmental contaminants as potential endocrine disrupters. Data are presented for about 80 potential environmental contaminants, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, phytoestrogens, and vertebrate steroids, and are compared with data for known (ant)agonists. Apart from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (a weak antagonist), vertebrate steroids were inactive at concentrations up to 10(-3) M. The vast majority of xenobiotics also showed no (ant)agonist activity. Among the industrial chemicals, antagonistic activity was observed for bisphenol A median effective concentration (EC50) of 1.0 x 10(-4) M and diethylphthalate (EC50 of 2.0 x 10(-3) M). Some organochlorine compounds also showed weak antagonistic activity, including o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), p,p'-DDE, dieldrin, and lindane (EC50 of 3.0 x 10(-5) M). For lindane, bisphenol A, and diethylphthalate, activity is not associated with impurities in the samples and, for lindane and bisphenol A at least, the compounds are able to compete with ecdysteroids for the ligand binding site on the receptor complex, albeit at concentrations very much higher than those found in the environment. The only pharmaceutical showing any detectable antagonist activity was 17alpha-ethynylestradiol. In the context of recent publications on potential endocrine disruption in marine and freshwater arthropods, these findings suggest that, for some compounds (e.g., diethylstilbestrol), ecdysteroid receptor-mediated responses are unlikely to be involved in producing chronic effects. The B(II) assay has a potentially valuable role to play in distinguishing between endocrine-mediated, which normally occur at submicromolar concentrations, and pharmacological effects in insects and crustaceans.",2001,"L Dinan, P Bourne, P Whiting, T S Dhadialla, T H Hutchinson, L Dinan, P Bourne, P Whiting, T S Dhadialla, T H Hutchinson"
Molecular analysis of a Drosophila melanogaster sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase allozyme variant that has cold labile activity,7633467,10.1016/0965-1748(95)00002-d,"A rare naturally occurring allele, GpdhACb62, at the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase locus in Drosophila melanogaster, encodes an enzyme with an electrophoretic mobility that is more cathodal than that produced by the common slow electrophoretic allele. After electrophoresis and staining of extracts of single adult flies there is a single band of activity corresponding in position to GPDH-1, but, using highly concentrated extracts, a faint band corresponding to GPDH-3 is observed. In GpdhACb62 homozygotes there is about 26% of the normal level of activity in adults, and less than 6% in third instar larvae. The reduction in activity is significantly greater than the decrease in GPDH immunologically cross-reacting material (CRM). Northern analyses, and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) of the 3' regions of the transcripts, show that the levels and structures of the poly(A)+RNAs are similar in homozygotes for GpdhACb62 and for a normal activity allele GpdhAC8. Hybridization to oligonucleotide probes specific for the GPDH-1 and GPDH-3 transcripts was of a similar intensity in GpdhACb62 and GpdhAC8 adult flies. In third instar larvae the main transcript is for GPDH-3 and again the hybridization signals were similar in each line. The activity of the enzyme produced by GpdhACb62 was unstable both at 50 degrees C and at 0 degrees C. The activity lost at 0 degrees C was recovered by incubation at 20 degrees C. The complete GpdhACb62 gene, and the partial Gpdh tandem duplication 3' to this gene, were cloned and sequenced. Comparisons with two normal activity GpdhF genes revealed 31 unique changes in the first copy of GpdhACb62. In exon 4, a T to G substitution changes cysteine to glycine and may disrupt a disulphide bond and be responsible for the distinctive properties of GPDH-ACb62.",1995,"J E Symonds, J B Gibson, A V Wilks, T M Wilanowski, J E Symonds, J B Gibson, A V Wilks, T M Wilanowski"
The genotoxicity of UVA irradiation in Drosophila melanogaster and the synergistic action of 8-methoxypsoralen and UVA,1499094,10.1093/carcin/13.8.1433,"To study the genotoxicity of near-ultraviolet light (UVA) on a whole body, Drosophila melanogaster larvae were irradiated with UVA and the emerging flies were examined for the mutant wing spot formation. The genotoxicity of UVA was also assayed with the in vivo DNA-repair test using males with repair-deficiency at the mei-9 and mei-41 locus and the matching repair-proficient females. Third-instar larvae were placed in a plastic Petri dish, which was covered with soft glass, and irradiated with black light at 4-5 W/m2. This irradiation resulted in an increase in mutant wing-hair spots. After a 15 h irradiation (approximately 240 kJ/m2), the mutant clone frequencies found in the adult flies (spots/wing) were: 1.68 for the small single spots, 0.38 for the large single spots and 0.11 for the twin spots, while at zero time they were 0.68, 0.06 and 0.02 respectively. On the other hand, the UVA irradiation was negative in the in vivo DNA-repair test, indicating that the UVA-induced DNA lesion may not be subject to repair by the mei-9 and mei-41 functions. The presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) during the irradiation remarkably enhanced somatic mutations, and showed a strong DNA-damaging effect in the repair test. For example, a 15 h UVA irradiation with 26.7 microM 8-MOP resulted in a 14-fold increase in the number of twin spots per wing as compared with the frequency obtained on treatment with UVA alone. Treatment of the larvae with 8-MOP alone gave no mutant clones or DNA damage. A high frequency in twin spot formation was also observed in this UVA + 8-MOP treatment, indicating that extensive chromosomal recombinations took place in the somatic cells.",1992,"T Negishi, F Tanabe, H Hayatsu, T Negishi, F Tanabe, H Hayatsu"
Stopped-flow studies of calcium dissociation from calcium-binding-site mutants of Drosophila melanogaster calmodulin,1576994,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb16879.x,"The kinetics of calcium dissociation from two groups of site-specific mutants of calmodulin from Drosophila melanogaster have been studied by stopped-flow kinetic methods, using the fluorescent calcium chelator 8-amino-2-[(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)methyl]-6- methoxyquinoline-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (Quin 2). The BQ series of mutants consists of four proteins in which one of the four bidentate glutamate residues (Glu12 of each of the four calcium binding loops) has been replaced by glutamine. In the BK series of mutants, the corresponding glutamate has been replaced by lysine. Calcium-dissociation kinetics of proteins with a mutation in site I or II (N-terminal domain) are consistent with a model in which the mutation weakens binding at the non-mutated N-terminal partner site and has a small, but significant, effect on the kinetic properties of sites III and IV (C-terminal domain). The proteins with a mutation in site III or IV show a large effect, with decreased Ca2+ dissociation rate from the unmodified N-terminal Ca(2+)-binding sites I and II. A structural interpretation is proposed, based on enhanced interactions between the domains when the affinity of individual sites have been dramatically reduced by mutation. This effect is greatest for the mutations in the C-terminal domain, which appear to destroy the co-operativity of Ca2+ binding at sites III and IV. The results show that site-specific mutation can have surprisingly far-ranging effects on kinetic properties of calmodulin. The kinetic analysis also shows that studies of specifically engineered mutants may in principle help to unmask the values of intrinsic rate constants for the wild-type protein which are not normally observable in the process of Ca2+ dissociation.",1992,"S R Martin, J F Maune, K Beckingham, P M Bayley, S R Martin, J F Maune, K Beckingham, P M Bayley"
Radiation and transposon-induced genetic damage in Drosophila melanogaster: X-ray dose-response and synergism with DNA-repair deficiency,1373851,10.1016/0027-5107(92)90108-e,"The interaction of X-ray-induced and transposon-induced damage was investigated in P-M hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. The X-ray dose-response of 330-1320 rad was monitored for sterility, fecundity and partial X/Y chromosome loss among F2 progeny derived from the dysgenic cross of M strain females xP strain males (cross A) and its reciprocal (cross B), using a weaker and the standard Harwich P strain subline. The synergistic effect of P element activity and X-rays on sterility was observed only in cross A hybrids and the dose-response was nonlinear in hybrids derived from the strong standard reference Harwich subline, Hw. This finding suggests that the lesions induced by both mutator systems which produce the synergistic effect are two-break events. The effect of increasing dose on the decline of fecundity was synergistic, but linear, in hybrids of either subline. There was no interaction evident and thus no synergism in X/Y nondisjunction and in partial Y chromosome loss measured by the loss of the Bs marker alone or together with the y+ marker. Interaction was detected in the loss of the y+ marker alone from the X and Y chromosomes. The possible three-way interaction of X-rays (660 rad), post-replication repair deficiency and P element mobility was assessed by measuring transmission distortion in dysgenic males derived from the II2 P strain. X-Irradiation of spermatids significantly increased the preferential elimination of the P-element-bearing second chromosome in mei-41, DNA-repair-deficient dysgenic males, but had no effect in their DNA-repair-proficient brothers. These findings indicate that the post-replication repair pathway is required for processing lesions induced by the combined effect of P element mobility and X-rays, and that the unrepaired lesions ultimately lead to chromosome loss.",1992,"H Balter, C S Griffith, L Margulies, H Balter, C S Griffith, L Margulies"
Molecular analysis of the lethal(1)B214 region at the base of the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster,1618027,10.1007/BF00582840,"Approximately 50 kb of genomic DNA was isolated from polytene chromosome bands 19F1 and 2 of Drosophila melanogaster. Bands 19F1 and 2 are in the immediate vicinity of the beta-heterochromatin at the base of the X chromosome and encompass the little fly-like and lethal(1)B214 complementation groups. The cloned DNA consists of an approximately 21 kb stretch of unique or low copy number sequence that is bounded by repetitive elements interspersed with further unique sequences. The presence of repeated sequences is characteristic of regions within and adjacent to beta-heterochromatin. At least part of a tRNA gene cluster is present within the 50 kb of cloned DNA. The cloned region also produces at least 18 discrete size classes of developmentally regulated poly(A)+ RNA species. A 2 kb EcoRI fragment (E10), which lies in the 21 kb stretch of unique sequence, generates seven of these transcripts (of sizes 3.5, 3.35, 2.1, 2.0, 1.5, 1.2 and 1.0 kb) in wild-type flies. However, a small deletion of approximately 75 bp in E10 in a lethal(1)B214 mutant allele is associated with alterations in the production or processing of all seven of these transcripts. These data identify E10 sequences as belonging to the lethal(1)B214 gene and suggest that the wild-type lethal(1)B214 gene encodes multiple transcripts. Furthermore, no transcripts of the same size and having the same developmental profile as those generated by the wild-type E10 fragment were identified by probes covering the remainder of the cloned region. This suggests that at least the larger transcripts hybridizing to E10 are partly transcribed from sequences located outside the cloned region, which indicates that the lethal(1)B214 gene extends for more than 20 kb and contains other transcriptionally active sequences within it.",1992,"R J Russell, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott, R J Russell, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott"

The Long 3'UTR mRNA of CaMKII Is Essential for Translation-Dependent Plasticity of Spontaneous Release in Drosophila melanogaster,28954869,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1313-17.2017,"A null mutation of the Drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gene (CaMKII) was generated using homologous recombination. Null animals survive to larval and pupal stages due to a large maternal contribution of CaMKII mRNA, which consists of a short 3'-untranslated region (UTR) form lacking regulatory elements that guide local translation. The selective loss of the long 3'UTR mRNA in CaMKII-null larvae allows us to test its role in plasticity. Development and evoked function of the larval neuromuscular junction are surprisingly normal, but the resting rate of miniature excitatory junctional potentials (mEJPs) is significantly lower in CaMKII mutants. Mutants also lack the ability to increase mEJP rate in response to spaced depolarization, a type of activity-dependent plasticity shown to require both transcription and translation. Consistent with this, overexpression of miR-289 in wild-type animals blocks plasticity of spontaneous release. In addition to the defects in regulation of mEJP rate, CaMKII protein is largely lost from synapses in the mutant. All phenotypes are non-sex-specific and rescued by a fosmid containing the entire wild-type CaMKII locus, but only viability and CaMKII localization are rescued by genomic fosmids lacking the long 3'UTR. This suggests that synaptic CaMKII accumulates by two distinct mechanisms: local synthesis requiring the long 3'UTR form of CaMKII mRNA and a process that requires zygotic transcription of CaMKII mRNA. The origin of synaptic CaMKII also dictates its functionality. Locally translated CaMKII has a privileged role in regulation of spontaneous release, which cannot be fulfilled by synaptic CaMKII from the other pool.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT As a regulator of synaptic development and plasticity, CaMKII has important roles in both normal and pathological function of the nervous system. CaMKII shows high conservation between Drosophila and humans, underscoring the usefulness of Drosophila in modeling its function. Drosophila CaMKII-null mutants remain viable throughout development, enabling morphological and electrophysiological characterization. Although the structure of the synapse is normal, maternally contributed CaMKII does not localize to synapses. Zygotic production of CaMKII mRNA with a long 3'-untranslated region is necessary for modulating spontaneous neurotransmission in an activity-dependent manner, but not for viability. These data argue that regulation of CaMKII localization and levels by local transcriptional processes is conserved. This is the first demonstration of distinct functions for Drosophila CaMKII mRNA variants.",2017,"Elena A Kuklin, Stephen Alkins, Baskar Bakthavachalu, Maria C Genco, Indulekha Sudhakaran, K Vijay Raghavan, Mani Ramaswami, Leslie C Griffith, Elena A Kuklin, Stephen Alkins, Baskar Bakthavachalu, Maria C Genco, Indulekha Sudhakaran, K Vijay Raghavan, Mani Ramaswami, Leslie C Griffith"
Phenotypic differences between Drosophila Alzheimer's disease models expressing human Aβ42 in the developing eye and brain,30460065,10.1080/19768354.2017.1313777,"Drosophila melanogaster expressing amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) transgenes have been used as models to study Alzheimer's disease. Various Aβ42 transgenes with different structures induce different phenotypes, which make it difficult to compare data among studies which use different transgenic lines. In this study, we compared the phenotypes of four frequently used Aβ42 transgenic lines, UAS-Aβ422X , UAS-Aβ42BL33770 , UAS-Aβ4211C39 , and UAS-Aβ42H29.3 . Among the four transgenic lines, only UAS-Aβ422X has two copies of the upstream activation sequence-amyloid-β42 (UAS-Aβ42) transgene, while remaining three have one copy. UAS-Aβ42BL33770 has the 3' untranslated region of Drosophila α-tubulin, while the others have that of SV40. UAS-Aβ4211C39 and UAS-Aβ42H29.3 have the rat pre-proenkephalin signal peptide, while UAS-Aβ422X and UAS-Aβ42BL33770 have that of the fly argos protein. When the transgenes were expressed ectopically in the developing eyes of the flies, UAS-Aβ422X transgene resulted in a strongly reduced and rough eye phenotype, while UAS-Aβ42BL33770 only showed a strong rough eye phenotype; UAS-Aβ42H29.3 and UAS-Aβ4211C39 had mild rough eyes. The levels of cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the eye imaginal discs were consistently the highest in UAS-Aβ422X , followed by UAS-Aβ42BL33770 , UAS-Aβ4211C39 , and UAS-Aβ42H29.3 . Surprisingly, the reduction in survival during the development of these lines did not correlate with cell death or ROS levels. The flies which expressed UAS-Aβ4211C39 or UAS-Aβ42H29.3 experienced greatly reduced survival rates, although low levels of ROS or cell death were detected. Collectively, our results demonstrated that different Drosophila AD models show different phenotypic severity, and suggested that different transgenes may have different modes of cytotoxicity.

Characterization of Drosophila GDNF receptor-like and evidence for its evolutionarily conserved interaction with neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)/FasII,23284846,10.1371/journal.pone.0051997,"Background:
      
    

    
      Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands are secreted growth factors distantly related to the TGF-β superfamily. In mammals, they bind to the GDNF family receptor α (Gfrα) and signal through the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. In order to gain insight into the evolution of the Ret-Gfr-Gdnf signaling system, we have cloned and characterized the first invertebrate Gfr-like cDNA (DmGfrl) from Drosophila melanogaster and generated a DmGfrl mutant allele.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that DmGfrl encodes a large GPI-anchored membrane protein with four GFR-like domains. In line with the fact that insects lack GDNF ligands, DmGfrl mediated neither Drosophila Ret phosphorylation nor mammalian RET phosphorylation. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that DmGfrl is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems throughout Drosophila development, but, surprisingly, DmGfrl and DmRet expression patterns were largely non-overlapping. We generated a DmGfrl null allele by genomic FLP deletion and found that both DmGfrl null females and males are viable but display fertility defects. The female fertility defect manifested as dorsal appendage malformation, small size and reduced viability of eggs laid by mutant females. In male flies DmGfrl interacted genetically with the Drosophila Ncam (neural cell adhesion molecule) homolog FasII to regulate fertility.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results suggest that Ret and Gfrl did not function as an in cis receptor-coreceptor pair before the emergence of GDNF family ligands, and that the Ncam-Gfr interaction predated the in cis Ret-Gfr interaction in evolution. The fertility defects that we describe in DmGfrl null flies suggest that GDNF receptor-like has an evolutionarily ancient role in regulating male fertility and a previously unrecognized role in regulating oogenesis.

Maximum Likelihood Implementation of an Isolation-with-Migration Model for Three Species,27486180,10.1093/sysbio/syw063,"We develop a maximum likelihood (ML) method for estimating migration rates between species using genomic sequence data. A species tree is used to accommodate the phylogenetic relationships among three species, allowing for migration between the two sister species, while the third species is used as an out-group. A Markov chain characterization of the genealogical process of coalescence and migration is used to integrate out the migration histories at each locus analytically, whereas Gaussian quadrature is used to integrate over the coalescent times on each genealogical tree numerically. This is an extension of our early implementation of the symmetrical isolation-with-migration model for three species to accommodate arbitrary loci with two or three sequences per locus and to allow asymmetrical migration rates. Our implementation can accommodate tens of thousands of loci, making it feasible to analyze genome-scale data sets to test for gene flow. We calculate the posterior probabilities of gene trees at individual loci to identify genomic regions that are likely to have been transferred between species due to gene flow. We conduct a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of the likelihood ratio test for gene flow between the two in-group species and of the ML estimates of model parameters such as the migration rate. Inclusion of data from a third out-group species is found to increase dramatically the power of the test and the precision of parameter estimation. We compiled and analyzed several genomic data sets from the Drosophila fruit flies. Our analyses suggest no migration from D. melanogaster to D. simulans, and a significant amount of gene flow from D. simulans to D. melanogaster, at the rate of ~0.02 migrant individuals per generation. We discuss the utility of the multispecies coalescent model for species tree estimation, accounting for incomplete lineage sorting and migration.",2017,"Daniel A Dalquen, Tianqi Zhu, Ziheng Yang, Daniel A Dalquen, Tianqi Zhu, Ziheng Yang"

      The native Australian fly Drosophila serrata belongs to the highly speciose montium subgroup of the melanogaster species group. It has recently emerged as an excellent model system with which to address a number of important questions, including the evolution of traits under sexual selection and traits involved in climatic adaptation along latitudinal gradients. Understanding the molecular genetic basis of such traits has been limited by a lack of genomic resources for this species. Here, we present the first expressed sequence tag (EST) collection for D. serrata that will enable the identification of genes underlying sexually-selected phenotypes and physiological responses to environmental change and may help resolve controversial phylogenetic relationships within the montium subgroup.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      A normalized cDNA library was constructed from whole fly bodies at several developmental stages, including larvae and adults. Assembly of 11,616 clones sequenced from the 3' end allowed us to identify 6,607 unique contigs, of which at least 90% encoded peptides. Partial transcripts were discovered from a variety of genes of evolutionary interest by BLASTing contigs against the 12 Drosophila genomes currently sequenced. By incorporating into the cDNA library multiple individuals from populations spanning a large portion of the geographical range of D. serrata, we were able to identify 11,057 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with 278 different contigs having at least one ""double hit"" SNP that is highly likely to be a real polymorphism. At least 394 EST-associated microsatellite markers, representing 355 different contigs, were also found, providing an additional set of genetic markers.

"The influence of donor age, nerve growth factor, and cografting with drosophila cells on survival of peripherally grafted embryonic or fetal rat dorsal root ganglia",14653618,10.3727/000000003108747325,"Previous studies have shown that embryonic rat and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells survive grafting to the cavity of extirpated adult rat DRG. Furthermore, grafted human embryonic neurons were shown to send axons peripherally and into the spinal cord, where they establish functional synaptic connections. This study analyzed the survival of orthotopically allografted rat DRG cells from embryonic stages 15 (E15) and 20 (E20), and the influence on their survival of nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF was delivered to the DRG transplants either by pump infusion or by cotransplantation of cells from Drosophila melanogaster, transgenic for human NGF. Lumbar DRGs of adult rats were removed and a collection of E15 or E20 DRGs placed in the cavity. One month after grafting the total number of DRG cells in the grafts was counted. Differentiation of subpopulations of DRG cells was estimated by counting cells immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4 (GSA), or heavy neurofilament protein (antibody RT97). The results show: i) similar survival of E15 and E20 grafts, with great variability in the survival of different subpopulations in E15 transplants, but a more consistent distribution of different phenotypes in E20 transplants; ii) infusion of NGF for 2 weeks increases the survival of E15 transplants, but has a negative effect on E20 transplants; iii) Drosophila cells transfected with human NGF gene survive peripheral xenografting and have a positive effect on the survival of the GSA- and CGRP-positive populations in E15 and E20 transplants; iv) Drosophila cells without the human NGF gene increase cell survival in E20 transplants. These data suggest that i) the effect of NGF is dependent on the embryonic stage of the transplants, ii) age-dependent sensitivity to NGF influences graft survival, and iii) transgenic Drosophila cells can be cotransplanted with embryonic neural tissue to the mammalian peripheral nervous system with a positive effect on the survival of neural grafts.",2003,"Galina Pavlova, Asa Enblom, Alexander Revishchin, Martin Sandelin, Leonid Korochkin, Elena N Kozlova, Galina Pavlova, Asa Enblom, Alexander Revishchin, Martin Sandelin, Leonid Korochkin, Elena N Kozlova"
A mathematical model provides mechanistic links to temporal patterns in Drosophila daily activity,27090880,10.1186/s12868-016-0248-9,"Background:
      
    

    
      Circadian clocks are endogenous biochemical oscillators that control daily behavioral rhythms in all living organisms. In fruit fly, the circadian rhythms are typically studied using power spectra of multiday behavioral recordings. Despite decades of study, a quantitative understanding of the temporal shape of Drosophila locomotor rhythms is missing. Locomotor recordings have been used mostly to extract the period of the circadian clock, leaving these data-rich time series largely underutilized. The power spectra of Drosophila and mouse locomotion often show multiple peaks in addition to the expected at T ~ 24 h. Several theoretical and experimental studies have previously used these data to examine interactions between the circadian and other endogenous rhythms, in some cases, attributing peaks in the T < 24 h regime to ultradian oscillators. However, the analysis of fly locomotion was typically performed without considering the shape of time series, while the shape of the signal plays important role in its power spectrum. To account for locomotion patterns in circadian studies we construct a mathematical model of fly activity. Our model allows careful analysis of the temporal shape of behavioral recordings and can provide important information about biochemical mechanisms that control fly activity.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we propose a mathematical model with four exponential terms and a single period of oscillation that closely reproduces the shape of the locomotor data in both time and frequency domains. Using our model, we reexamine interactions between the circadian and other endogenous rhythms and show that the proposed single-period waveform is sufficient to explain the position and height of >88 % of spectral peaks in the locomotion of wild-type and circadian mutants of Drosophila. In the time domain, we find the timescales of the exponentials in our model to be ~1.5 h(-1) on average.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Our results indicate that multiple spectral peaks from fly locomotion are simply harmonics of the circadian period rather than independent ultradian oscillators as previously reported. From timescales of the exponentials we hypothesize that model rates reflect activity of the neuropeptides that likely transduce signals of the circadian clock and the sleep-wake homeostat to shape behavioral outputs.",2016,"Andrey Lazopulo, Sheyum Syed, Andrey Lazopulo, Sheyum Syed"
The expression of pannier and achaete-scute homologues in a mosquito suggests an ancient role of pannier as a selector gene in the regulation of the dorsal body pattern,12135924,,"The Drosophila gene pannier (pnr) has recently been assigned to a new class of selector genes (Calleja, M., Herranz, H., Estella, C., Casal, J., Lawrence, P., Simpson, P. and Morata, G. (2000). Development 127, 3971-3980; (Mann, R. S. and Morata, G. (2000). ANNU: Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 16, 243-271). It specifies pattern in the dorsal body. On the dorsal notum it is expressed in a broad medial domain and directly regulates transcription of the achaete-scute (ac-sc) genes driving their expression in small discrete clusters within this domain at the sites of each future bristle. This spatial resolution is achieved through modulation of Pnr activity by specific co-factors and by a number of discrete cis-regulatory enhancers in the ac-sc gene complex. We have isolated homologues of pnr and ac-sc in Anopheles gambiae, a basal species of Diptera that diverged from Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) about 200 million years ago, and examined their expression patterns. We found that an ac-sc homologue of Anopheles, Ag-ASH, is expressed on the dorsal medial notum at the sites where sensory organs emerge in several domains that are identical to those of the pnr homologue, Ag-pnr. This suggests that activation of Ag-ASH by Ag-Pnr has been conserved. Indeed, when expressed in Drosophila, Ag-pnr is able to mimic the effects of ectopic expression of Dm-pnr and induce ectopic bristles. These results are discussed in the context of the gene duplication events and the acquisition of a modular promoter, that may have occurred at different times in the lineage leading to derived species such as Drosophila. The bristle pattern of Anopheles correlates in a novel fashion with the expression domains of Ag-pnr/Ag-ASH. While precursors for the sensory scales can arise anywhere within the expression domains, bristle precursors arise exclusively along the borders. This points to the existence of specific positional information along the borders, and suggests that Ag-pnr specifies pattern in the medial, dorsal notum, as in Drosophila, but via a different mechanism.",2002,"Corinna Wülbeck, Pat Simpson, Corinna Wülbeck, Pat Simpson"
Importance of multiple hydroxylated metabolites in hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA)-mediated mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,2499776,10.1016/0027-5107(89)90071-7,"The mutagenic profiles in Drosophila and the influence of inhibition of metabolism on genotoxic activity were determined for hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA), some synthetically prepared presumed metabolites and ethylated analogs. Demethylated HMPA metabolites are considerably less mutagenic than HMPA, dependent on the degree of demethylation. The mutagenicity of the presumptive primary metabolite, hydroxymethyl pentamethylphosphoramide (HM-Me5-PA), is comparable to HMPA and can be decreased considerably by inhibition of the metabolism by 1-phenylimidazole or iproniazid. This suggests that further oxidative metabolism is required for mutagenic activity. The mutagenicity of the doubly hydroxylated HMPA metabolite, N,N'-bis(hydroxymethyl)-tetramethylphosphoramide (N,N'-(HM)2-Me4-PA) can also be decreased by inhibition of metabolism, whereas the 3-fold hydroxylated N,N',-N""-(HM)3-Me3-PA is not affected by pretreatment with enzyme inhibitors, indicating that no further oxidative metabolism is required for its activation. A second hydroxylation on 1 dimethylamino group, forming N,N-(HM)2-Me4-PA, results in a drastic loss of mutagenic activity. Further oxidation of HM-Me5-PA to formyl pentamethylphosphoramide (formyl-Me5-PA) also leads to a strong reduction of the genotoxic activity. The rearrangement product of N-oxidation, N-[bis(dimethylamino)phosphinyl)-oxy)dimethylamine (HMPOA) is not mutagenic in Drosophila. The very low mutagenicity of hexaethylphosphoramide (Et6-PA) allowed us to study the mutagenicity of some ethyl-hydroxymethyl hybrid compounds. For the ethylated phosphoramides also the presence of only 1 hydroxymethyl group is insufficient for mutagenic activity, whereas the introduction of 2 or 3 hydroxymethyl groups resulted in considerable genotoxicity in the sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL) test as well as in the ring-X loss test. It is concluded that the bioactivation of HMPA in Drosophila proceeds via multiple metabolic hydroxylations to form multifunctional, cross-linking agents. The presence of an oxygen atom on the phosphorus appears to be a prerequisite for the genotoxic activity of HMPA as hexamethylphosphorus triamide (HMPT), a derivative lacking this oxygen, is only weakly mutagenic in Drosophila. The results presented in this paper do not support the theory that formaldehyde is the active principle of activated HMPA.",1989,"J A Zijlstra, J Brussee, A van der Gen, E W Vogel, J A Zijlstra, J Brussee, A van der Gen, E W Vogel"
Monoclonal antibodies prepared against the major Drosophila nuclear Matrix-pore complex-lamina glycoprotein bind specifically to the nuclear envelope in situ,3919018,,"A high molecular weight glycoprotein found associated with a nuclear matrix-pore complex-lamina (NMPCL) preparation obtained from Drosophila melanogaster embryos has been shown by in vitro analyses to be largely confined to this subcellular fraction. In contrast with several of the NMPCL proteins, this glycoprotein remains completely insoluble after treatment with 5 M urea. It has, therefore, been possible to separate the glycoprotein from other NMPCL components by differential urea extraction. The glycoprotein in the 5 M urea-extracted pellet has been solubilized by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate and purified to near-homogeneity by sequential steps of chromatography on hydroxylapatite and Sephacryl S-300 (both run in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), followed by affinity chromatography on lentil lectin-Sepharose. Over 30 hybridoma cell lines producing antibodies against this glycoprotein have been obtained. Monoclonality has been established for two of these lines (designated AGP-26 and AGP-78), and the antibodies they secrete have been further characterized. Western blot analysis has shown both antibodies to be monospecific (with respect to other Drosophila embryo polypeptides) for the major NMPCL glycoprotein; in addition, antibody AGP-78 has been shown to be weakly cross-reactive with glycoproteins of similar or identical molecular weight found associated with isolated nuclear fractions obtained from Xenopus oocytes, as well as chicken, opossum, and rat livers. Finally, both antibodies AGP-26 and AGP-78 react exclusively with the Drosophila nuclear periphery (nuclear envelope) in situ as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence analysis of larval cryosections.

Here, we purify endogenous, GFP-tagged Augmin and γ-TuRC from Drosophila embryos to near homogeneity using a novel one-step affinity technique. We demonstrate that, in vitro, while Augmin alone does not affect Tubulin polymerisation dynamics, it stimulates γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also assemble and visualise the MT-Augmin-γ-TuRC-MT junction using light microscopy. Our work therefore conclusively reconstitutes branching MT nucleation.

Failures in such mechanisms can drive tumorigenesis. In Drosophila neural stem cell (NSC) lineages, excessive Notch signalling results in supernumerary NSCs causing hyperplasia. However, onset of hyperplasia is considerably delayed implying there are mechanisms that resist the mitogenic signal. Monitoring the live expression of a Notch target gene, E(spl)mγ, revealed that normal attenuation is still initiated in the presence of excess Notch activity so that re-emergence of NSC properties occurs only in older progeny. Screening for factors responsible, we found that depletion of Mi-2/NuRD ATP remodeling complex dramatically enhanced Notch-induced hyperplasia. Under these conditions, E(spl)mγ was no longer extinguished in NSC progeny. We propose that Mi-2 is required for decommissioning stem-cell enhancers in their progeny, enabling the switch towards more differentiated fates and rendering them insensitive to mitogenic factors such as Notch.",2019,"Evanthia Zacharioudaki, Julia Falo Sanjuan, Sarah Bray, Evanthia Zacharioudaki, Julia Falo Sanjuan, Sarah Bray"

We used these binding signatures to dissect two properties of developmental enhancers: (1) potential TF cooperativity, using signatures of co-associations and co-divergence in TF occupancy. This revealed conserved combinatorial binding despite sequence divergence, suggesting protein-protein interactions sustain conserved collective occupancy. (2) Enhancer in-vivo activity, revealing orthologous enhancers with conserved activity despite divergence in TF occupancy.

Evolutionary changes in transcription factor coding sequence quantitatively alter sensory organ development and function,28406397,10.7554/eLife.26402,"Animals are characterized by a set of highly conserved developmental regulators. Changes in the cis-regulatory elements of these regulators are thought to constitute the major driver of morphological evolution. However, the role of coding sequence evolution remains unresolved. To address this question, we used the Atonal family of proneural transcription factors as a model. Drosophila atonal coding sequence was endogenously replaced with that of atonal homologues (ATHs) at key phylogenetic positions, non-ATH proneural genes, and the closest homologue to ancestral proneural genes. ATHs and the ancestral-like coding sequences rescued sensory organ fate in atonal mutants, in contrast to non-ATHs. Surprisingly, different ATH factors displayed different levels of proneural activity as reflected by the number and functionality of sense organs. This proneural potency gradient correlated directly with ATH protein stability, including in response to Notch signaling, independently of mRNA levels or codon usage.

Previous studies have proposed that loss of FXN causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leads to the demise of neurons. Here we describe a ROS independent mechanism that contributes to neurodegeneration in fly FXN mutants. We show that loss of frataxin homolog (fh) in Drosophila leads to iron toxicity, which in turn induces sphingolipid synthesis and ectopically activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2). Dampening iron toxicity, inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis by Myriocin, or reducing Pdk1 or Mef2 levels, all effectively suppress neurodegeneration in fh mutants. Moreover, increasing dihydrosphingosine activates Mef2 activity through PDK1 in mammalian neuronal cell line suggesting that the mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved.

A feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny promotes tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis,27187149,10.7554/eLife.14330,"Homeostatic renewal of many adult tissues requires balanced self-renewal and differentiation of local stem cells, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in Drosophila. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In Sox21a mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.",2016,"Jun Chen, Na Xu, Huanwei Huang, Tao Cai, Rongwen Xi, Jun Chen, Na Xu, Huanwei Huang, Tao Cai, Rongwen Xi"
CasExpress reveals widespread and diverse patterns of cell survival of caspase-3 activation during development in vivo,27058168,10.7554/eLife.10936,"Caspase-3 carries out the executioner phase of apoptosis, however under special circumstances, cells can survive its activity. To document systematically where and when cells survive caspase-3 activation in vivo, we designed a system, CasExpress, which drives fluorescent protein expression, transiently or permanently, in cells that survive caspase-3 activation in Drosophila. We discovered widespread survival of caspase-3 activity. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns emerged in different tissues. Some cells activated caspase-3 during their normal development in every cell and in every animal without evidence of apoptosis. In other tissues, such as the brain, expression was sporadic both temporally and spatially and overlapped with periods of apoptosis. In adults, reporter expression was evident in a large fraction of cells in most tissues of every animal; however the precise patterns varied. Inhibition of caspase activity in wing discs reduced wing size demonstrating functional significance.

Having validated the formalism on computer simulations, we quantified separately all morphogenetic events in the Drosophila dorsal thorax and wing pupal epithelia to obtain comprehensive statistical maps linking cell and tissue scale dynamics. While globally cell shape changes, rearrangements and divisions all significantly participate in tissue morphogenesis, locally, their relative participations display major variations in space and time. By blocking division we analyzed the impact of division on rearrangements, cell shape changes and tissue morphogenesis.

Regulation of food intake by mechanosensory ion channels in enteric neurons,25285450,10.7554/eLife.04402,"Regulation of food intake is fundamental to energy homeostasis in animals. The contribution of non-nutritive and metabolic signals in regulating feeding is unclear. Here we show that enteric neurons play a major role in regulating feeding through specialized mechanosensory ion channels in Drosophila. Modulating activities of a specific subset of enteric neurons, the posterior enteric neurons (PENs), results in sixfold changes in food intake. Deficiency of the mechanosensory ion channel PPK1 gene or RNAi knockdown of its expression in the PENS result in a similar increase in food intake, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type PPK1 in the same neurons. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of the mechanosensory ion channel phenocopies the result of genetic interrogation. Together, our study provides the first molecular genetic evidence that mechanosensory ion channels in the enteric neurons are involved in regulating feeding, offering an enticing alternative to current therapeutic strategy for weight control.",2014,"William H Olds, Tian Xu, William H Olds, Tian Xu"
Extensive translation of small Open Reading Frames revealed by Poly-Ribo-Seq,25144939,10.7554/eLife.03528,"Thousands of small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) with the potential to encode small peptides of fewer than 100 amino acids exist in our genomes.

In this study, we present a genome-wide assessment of smORF translation by ribosomal profiling of polysomal fractions in Drosophila. We detect two types of smORFs bound by multiple ribosomes and thus undergoing productive translation. The 'longer' smORFs of around 80 amino acids resemble canonical proteins in translational metrics and conservation, and display a propensity to contain transmembrane motifs. The 'dwarf' smORFs are in general shorter (around 20 amino-acid long), are mostly found in 5'-UTRs and non-coding RNAs, are less well conserved, and have no bioinformatic indicators of peptide function.

Cellular resolution models for even skipped regulation in the entire Drosophila embryo,23930223,10.7554/eLife.00522,"Transcriptional control ensures genes are expressed in the right amounts at the correct times and locations. Understanding quantitatively how regulatory systems convert input signals to appropriate outputs remains a challenge. For the first time, we successfully model even skipped (eve) stripes 2 and 3+7 across the entire fly embryo at cellular resolution. A straightforward statistical relationship explains how transcription factor (TF) concentrations define eve's complex spatial expression, without the need for pairwise interactions or cross-regulatory dynamics. Simulating thousands of TF combinations, we recover known regulators and suggest new candidates. Finally, we accurately predict the intricate effects of perturbations including TF mutations and misexpression. Our approach imposes minimal assumptions about regulatory function; instead we infer underlying mechanisms from models that best fit the data, like the lack of TF-specific thresholds and the positional value of homotypic interactions.

In this chapter, we present an overview of the research on the (co)evolutionary interaction between Drosophila and their parasitoids, with the main focus on the cellular immune response of D. melanogaster, and the counter-resistance mechanism of one of its main parasitoids, Asobara tabida. A key aspect of this interaction is the existence of genetic variation: in the field, host resistance and parasitoid counter-resistance vary, both between and within populations. Host resistance and parasitoid counter-resistance are costly, and both these costs turn out to be density dependent. These tradeoffs can explain the existence of genetic variation. We briefly touch upon behavioral aspects of the interaction and the parasites and pathogens that the parasitoids themselves suffer from.

Tailless/TLX reverts intermediate neural progenitors to stem cells driving tumourigenesis via repression of asense/ASCL1,32073402,10.7554/eLife.53377,"Understanding the sequence of events leading to cancer relies in large part upon identifying the tumour cell of origin. Glioblastoma is the most malignant brain cancer but the early stages of disease progression remain elusive. Neural lineages have been implicated as cells of origin, as have glia. Interestingly, high levels of the neural stem cell regulator TLX correlate with poor patient prognosis. Here we show that high levels of the Drosophila TLX homologue, Tailless, initiate tumourigenesis by reverting intermediate neural progenitors to a stem cell state. Strikingly, we could block tumour formation completely by re-expressing Asense (homologue of human ASCL1), which we show is a direct target of Tailless. Our results predict that expression of TLX and ASCL1 should be mutually exclusive in glioblastoma, which was verified in single-cell RNA-seq of human glioblastoma samples.

Eight subtypes of T4/T5 neurons are defined by combinations of two patterns of dendritic inputs and four patterns of axonal outputs. Single-cell profiling during development revealed distinct transcriptional programs defining each dendrite and axon wiring pattern. These programs were defined by the expression of a few transcription factors and different combinations of cell surface proteins. Gain and loss of function studies provide evidence for independent control of different wiring features.

First, Drosophila neuroblasts express opposing temporal gradients of RNA-binding proteins, Imp and Syp. These proteins promote or inhibit chinmo translation, yielding a descending neuronal gradient. Together, first and second-layer temporal factors define a temporal expression window of BTB-zinc finger nuclear protein, Mamo. The precise temporal induction of Mamo is achieved via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, Mamo is essential for the temporally defined, terminal identity of α'/β' mushroom body neurons and identity maintenance. We describe a straightforward paradigm of temporal fate specification where diverse neuronal fates are defined via integrating multiple layers of gene regulation.

This depends on Panoramix (Panx); however, precisely how an RNA binding event silences transcription remains to be determined. Here we show that Nuclear Export Factor 2 (Nxf2) and its co-factor, Nxt1, form a complex with Panx and are required for co-transcriptional silencing of transposons in somatic and germline cells of the ovary. Tethering of Nxf2 or Nxt1 to RNA results in silencing of target loci and the concomitant accumulation of repressive chromatin marks.

We show that the cytokine receptor homolog Dome, acting downstream of the niche-derived ligand Upd, directly binds to the microtubule-binding protein Eb1 to regulate spindle orientation in Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs). Dome's role in spindle orientation is entirely separable from its known function in self-renewal mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway.

Using acute inactivation approaches and live-cell imaging in Drosophila embryos, we dissect the role of condensin I in the maintenance of mitotic chromosome structure with unprecedented temporal resolution. Removal of condensin I from pre-established chromosomes results in rapid disassembly of centromeric regions while most chromatin mass undergoes hyper-compaction. This is accompanied by drastic changes in the degree of sister chromatid intertwines. While wild-type metaphase chromosomes display residual levels of catenations, upon timely removal of condensin I, chromosomes present high levels of de novo Topoisomerase II (TopoII)-dependent re-entanglements, and complete failure in chromosome segregation. TopoII is thus capable of re-intertwining previously separated DNA molecules and condensin I continuously required to counteract this erroneous activity.

We observed global dysregulation of mRNA levels in H3K36R animals that correlates with the incidence of H3K36me3. Similar to previous studies, we found that mutation of H3K36 also resulted in H4 hyperacetylation. However, neither cryptic transcription initiation, nor alternative pre-mRNA splicing, contributed to the observed changes in expression, in contrast with previously reported roles for H3K36me. Interestingly, knockdown of the RNA surveillance nuclease, Xrn1, and members of the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex, restored mRNA levels for a class of downregulated, H3K36me3-rich genes.

EGFR gene methylation is not involved in Royalactin controlled phenotypic polymorphism in honey bees,26358539,10.1038/srep14070,"The 2011 highly publicised Nature paper by Kamakura on honeybee phenotypic dimorphism, (also using Drosophila as an experimental surrogate), claims that a single protein in royal jelly, Royalactin, essentially acts as a master ""on-off"" switch in development via the epidermal growth factor receptor (AmEGFR), to seal the fate of queen or worker. One mechanism proposed in that study as important for the action of Royalactin is differential amegfr methylation in alternate organismal outcomes. According to the author differential methylation of amegfr was experimentally confirmed and shown in a supportive figure. Here we have conducted an extensive analysis of the honeybee egfr locus and show that this gene is never methylated. We discuss several lines of evidence casting serious doubts on the amegfr methylation result in the 2011 paper and consider possible origins of the author's statement.

RNAi depletion of KPNB1 traps the PER/CRY complex in the cytoplasm by blocking nuclear entry of PER proteins in human cells. KPNB1 interacts mainly with PER proteins and directs PER/CRY nuclear transport in a circadian fashion. Interestingly, KPNB1 regulates the PER/CRY nuclear entry and repressor function, independently of importin α, its classical partner.

Gpr52 is located within an intron of Rabgap1l, which exhibits epistatic effects on Gpr52-mediated modulation of Htt levels by inhibiting its substrate Rab39B, which co-localizes with Htt and translocates Htt to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Prefixation that combined ethanol and acetic acid exposure led to prominent immunofluorescent staining of the bands, generally but not strictly correlating with the total DNA content.

Here, we discovered that microtubules promote actomyosin intercellular attachments in epithelia during Drosophila melanogaster mesoderm invagination. First, we used live imaging to show a novel arrangement of the microtubule cytoskeleton during apical constriction: medioapical Patronin (CAMSAP) foci formed by actomyosin contraction organized an apical noncentrosomal microtubule network. Microtubules were required for mesoderm invagination but were not necessary for initiating apical contractility or adherens junction assembly.

Here, we investigate the formation and stability of radical oxygen species in Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome using molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure calculations. We find that the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals in doublet spin states are stabilized in the pocket due to the attractive electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding with partially reduced FAD.

The microRNA toolkit of insects,27883064,10.1038/srep37736,"Is there a correlation between miRNA diversity and levels of organismic complexity? Exhibiting extraordinary levels of morphological and developmental complexity, insects are the most diverse animal class on earth. Their evolutionary success was in particular shaped by the innovation of holometabolan metamorphosis in endopterygotes. Previously, miRNA evolution had been linked to morphological complexity, but astonishing variation in the currently available miRNA complements of insects made this link unclear. To address this issue, we sequenced the miRNA complement of the hemimetabolan Blattella germanica and reannotated that of two other hemimetabolan species, Locusta migratoria and Acyrthosiphon pisum, and of four holometabolan species, Apis mellifera, Tribolium castaneum, Bombyx mori and Drosophila melanogaster. Our analyses show that the variation of insect miRNAs is an artefact mainly resulting from poor sampling and inaccurate miRNA annotation, and that insects share a conserved microRNA toolkit of 65 families exhibiting very low variation. For example, the evolutionary shift toward a complete metamorphosis was accompanied only by the acquisition of three and the loss of one miRNA families.",2016,"Guillem Ylla, Bastian Fromm, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Xavier Belles, Guillem Ylla, Bastian Fromm, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Xavier Belles"
Selfish drive can trump function when animal mitochondrial genomes compete,27270106,10.1038/ng.3587,"Mitochondrial genomes compete for transmission from mother to progeny. We explored this competition by introducing a second genome into Drosophila melanogaster to follow transmission. Competitions between closely related genomes favored those functional in electron transport, resulting in a host-beneficial purifying selection. In contrast, matchups between distantly related genomes often favored those with negligible, negative or lethal consequences, indicating selfish selection. Exhibiting powerful selfish selection, a genome carrying a detrimental mutation displaced a complementing genome, leading to population death after several generations. In a different pairing, opposing selfish and purifying selection counterbalanced to give stable transmission of two genomes. Sequencing of recombinant mitochondrial genomes showed that the noncoding region, containing origins of replication, governs selfish transmission. Uniparental inheritance prevents encounters between distantly related genomes. Nonetheless, in each maternal lineage, constant competition among sibling genomes selects for super-replicators. We suggest that this relentless competition drives positive selection, promoting change in the sequences influencing transmission.",2016,"Hansong Ma, Patrick H O'Farrell, Hansong Ma, Patrick H O'Farrell"

In addition, attraction to tethered larvae still occurs across a clear plastic barrier, does not occur significantly in the dark and attraction occurs to a computer screen movie of larval motion.

Subsequently, we reverse engineered the transfer function mapping body pitch angle onto flight speed. A linear model is able to reproduce the behavioural data with good accuracy. Our results show that linearity in speed control is realized already at the level of body posture-mediated speed control and is therefore embodied at the level of the complex aerodynamic mechanisms of body and wings.

Dosage compensation of the active X chromosome in mammals,16341221,10.1038/ng1705,"Monosomy of the X chromosome owing to divergence between the sex chromosomes leads to dosage compensation mechanisms to restore balanced expression between the X and the autosomes.

Together with X inactivation, this mechanism would maintain balanced expression between the X chromosome and autosomes and between the sexes. Here, we show that doubling of the global expression level of the X chromosome leads to dosage compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues, consistent with a role in cognitive functions. Furthermore, the X chromosome is expressed but not upregulated in spermatids and secondary oocytes, preserving balanced expression of the genome in these haploid cells.

Three model organisms have recently made significant contributions towards a mechanistic model of operant conditioning, because of their special technical advantages. Research using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster implicated the ignorant gene in operant conditioning in the heat-box, research on the sea slug Aplysia californica contributed a cellular mechanism of behavior selection at a convergence point of operant behavior and reward, and research on the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis elucidated the role of a behavior-initiating neuron in operant conditioning.

Target Explorer: An automated tool for the identification of new target genes for a specified set of transcription factors,12824372,10.1093/nar/gkg544,"With the increasing number of eukaryotic genomes available, high-throughput automated tools for identification of regulatory DNA sequences are becoming increasingly feasible. Several computational approaches for the prediction of regulatory elements were recently developed. Here we combine the prediction of clusters of binding sites for transcription factors with context information taken from genome annotations. Target Explorer automates the entire process from the creation of a customized library of binding sites for known transcription factors through the prediction and annotation of putative target genes that are potentially regulated by these factors. It was specifically designed for the well-annotated Drosophila melanogaster genome, but most options can be used for sequences from other genomes as well.

DSP1 interacts with bicoid for knirps enhancement,12820172,10.1002/gene.10201,"DSP1 is an HMG-box protein which has been implicated in the regulation of homeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster.

Genetic interaction studies demonstrate that a bcd mutation enhances the A4 defect of dsp1(1). We present in vitro and in vivo evidences for a direct interaction between DSP1 and Bicoid, mediated by the BCD homeodomain and the HMG box of DSP1.

Experimental evolution of learning ability in fruit flies,12391295,10.1073/pnas.222371199,"The presence of genetic variation for learning ability in animals opens the way for experiments asking how and under what ecological circumstances improved learning ability should evolve. Here we report experimental evolution of learning ability in Drosophila melanogaster. We exposed experimental populations for 51 generations to conditions that we expected to favor associative learning with regard to oviposition substrate choice. Flies that learned to associate a chemical cue (quinine) with a particular substrate, and still avoided this substrate several hours after the cue had been removed, were expected to contribute more alleles to the next generation. From about generation 15 on, the experimental populations showed marked ability to avoid oviposition substrates that several hours earlier had contained the chemical cue. The improved response to conditioning was also expressed when the flies were faced with a choice of novel media. We demonstrate that these behavioral changes are caused by the evolution of both a higher learning rate and a better memory.",2002,"Frederic Mery, Tadeusz J Kawecki, Frederic Mery, Tadeusz J Kawecki"

Oviposition behaviour was influenced by the conformation and by the texture of the substrate, but this does not account for the selective differences in levels of aggregation which are under genetic control. The distribution of males of both selected populations tends to be overdispersed across resource patches. This observation is consistent with male territorial behaviour. The dispersal patterns of females of the two selected populations differ significantly. H females show a contagious distribution whereas the distribution for L females is more nearly random. Differences in adult female dispersion are likely to be a significant factor contributing to aggregated oviposition.

Construction of an unstable Ring-X chromosome bearing the autosomal dopa decarboxylase gene in Drosophila melanogaster and analysis of Ddc mosaics,3104136,,"An unstable Ring-X chromosome, Ddc+ -Ring-X carrying a cloned Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) encoding segment was constructed. The construction involved a double recombination event between the unstable Ring-X, R(1)wvC and a Rod-X chromosome which contained a P-element mediated Ddc+ insert. The resulting Ddc+ -Ring-X chromosome behaves similarly to the parent chromosome with respect to somatic instability. The Ddc+ -Ring-X chromosome was used to generate Ddc mosaics. Analyses of Ddc mosaics revealed that while there was no absolute requirement for the Ddc+ expression in either the epidermis or the nervous system, very large mutant clones did affect the viability of the mosaic.",1987,"D A Gailey, D L Bordne, A M Vallés, J C Hall, K White, D A Gailey, D L Bordne, A M Vallés, J C Hall, K White"
Analysis of the dosage compensation of a specific transcript in Drosophila melanogaster,3082711,,The amount of steady-state level RNA complementary to the X-linked salivary gland secretion polypeptide gene Sgs-4 was measured in male and female third-instar larvae carrying one or two doses of a wild-type allele of the gene. RNA levels were found to be compensated in normal one-dose males and two-dose females and to be dosage-dependent within each sex. The presence of mutant alleles of male-less (mle) was found to reduce the level of Sgs-4 transcripts in males. These results support the contentions that dosage compensation is mediated by regulating the level of X-linked gene transcripts and that a product of the mle+ gene is involved in this process.,1986,"T R Breen, J C Lucchesi, T R Breen, J C Lucchesi"
Localization and expression of transformed DNA sequences within heat shock puffs of Drosophila melanogaster,3933923,10.1007/BF01259442,"In situ hybridization at high resolution with biotin-labeled DNA was used to locate specific transcriptional units within the chromosomal puffs of normal heat shock loci and of new heat shock loci generated by transformation. This method resolves copies of the hsp70 gene that are separated by 40 kb within the 87C heat shock locus. In the case of two new puff loci generated by transformation, the heat-activated transcript is encoded by sequences that reside entirely within the puff domain and the activated promoter is positioned asymmetrically within the puff. However, an adjacent promoter and its transcriptional unit which do not appear to be induced by heat shock are also within the puff. These results support the idea that a chromosomal puff is a structure that facilitates or results from vigorous transcription, but that the structural change alone is insufficient to induce transcription.",1985,"J A Simon, C A Sutton, J T Lis, J A Simon, C A Sutton, J T Lis"
Reexamination of diversifying selection of polymorphic allozyme genes by using population cages in Drosophila melanogaster,16593373,10.1073/pnas.80.18.5789,"Several investigators have reported increased heterozygosity for allozyme markers in laboratory experiments simulating a variable environment and have concluded that there is diversifying selection for allozyme variants. We found no change in heterozygosity in 28 large population cages where temperature, food, and light were each set at three levels, two constant and one variable, in a factorial design. Specifically, there was no change in heterozygosity when 0, 1, 2, or 3 factors were variable. The discrepancy between our negative results and earlier positive ones is that our experiments were started from a large caged population of flies which had been maintained for 6 years-long enough to be very near to linkage equilibrium. We suggest that the earlier results may have been the result of linkage between neutral, or nearly neutral, allozyme markers and selected loci or in some cases, inversions.",1983,"T Yamazaki, S Kusakabe, H Tachida, M Ichinose, H Yoshimaru, Y Matsuo, T Mukai, T Yamazaki, S Kusakabe, H Tachida, M Ichinose, H Yoshimaru, Y Matsuo, T Mukai"
Expression of the yolk-protein genes in the mutant doublesex dominant (dsxD) of Drosophila melanogaster,6193215,,"Adult flies mutant for doublesex dominant (dsxD) are intermediate in phenotype between males and females. The dsxD mutation acts in the heterozygous state to transform only flies with two X chromosomes into intersexes, XY flies are unaffected by the mutation. Yolk-protein synthesis, which normally occurs in the ovaries and fat bodies of females, but not in males unless stimulated with 20-hydroxy-ecdysone, is reduced. The dsxD fat body synthesizes less yolk proteins throughout adult life, and the gonads rarely make yolk proteins. Using cloned yolk-protein genes as probes for measuring transcript levels we have shown that expression of these genes in dsxD is regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. We suggest that the dsxD locus regulates the expression of the yolk-protein genes from within the fat body cells and does not operate by modulating ecdysteroid titres in the adults.",1983,"M Bownes, M Dempster, M Blair, M Bownes, M Dempster, M Blair"

Distal into proximal (Dipr): a homoeotic mutation of Drosophila melanogaster,6801435,10.1007/BF00352532,"The morphology and genetical characteristics of a new dominant homoeotic mutation, called Distal into proximal (Dipr), are described. Dipr causes two main abnormalities, both of which are specific to distal regions of the adult appendages (i.e. the wing, haltere, legs, antenna, and proboscis); first that distal parts are reduced in size and second that the patterns found distally resemble those normally localised in more proximal parts. The mutation maps to the right arm of chromosome 3 and is associated with an inversion with breakpoints in 84D and 84F. Analysis of revertants of Dipr show that the right breakpoint of In(3R)Dipr is the one responsible for the mutant phenotype. Complementation analyses of Dipr revertants and dosage studies of Dipr with different doses of Dipr+ indicate that the mutant is a hypermorph affecting the normal expression of a gene localised in 84F.

The role of X-linked lethal and viable male-sterile mutations in male gametogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster: genetic analysis,97511,10.1007/BF00331001,"The possibility that viable male-sterile mutations occur in vital genes and the role played by lethal mutations and viable male-steriles in male gametogenesis were studied. Five sterile loci were identified among the 30 most proximal vital loci of the X-chromosome and two of them were shown to be allelic with lethal mutations. Fertility test on gynanders for nonautonomous lethal mutations proved that vital genes operate autonomously in male gonads, independently of their effect on somatic tissues. Fertility tests of ts lethals, shifted to the nonpermissive temperature after the TSP, showed that 40% of vital genes function in male gonads. It is further shown that about the same proportion of vital genes is operating in female gonads and that the two groups overlap by about 70%.

Both segments were sensitive at 30 degree, while only the proximal one responded to 34 degree treatment. When the same segments were studied in structural heterozygotes (for deletions) the relative increase in recombination was greater, suggesting that heat exerts its effect on the ""pairing"" rather than the ""exchange"" components of crossing over. The effect of c (3) G/+ on the same segments in both homozygous and heterozygous structurals was studied.

The complementation leading to male fertility is only partial complementation: the fecundity of most fertile genotypes is less than half that of controls. The three components of the SD system, the Sd locus, the Ac locus, and the modifiers in 2R, were examined separately, and it appears that the complementation is a phenomenon associated with the Sd locus. A hypothesis of the molecular events involved in segregation distortion is formulated in the light of these observations.

The emerging picture is that many of these receptors may provide the strong adhesion needed to increase the likelihood of contact between the PtdSerR and its phospholipid ligand, which is required for uptake. Furthermore, stimulation of this receptor on different types of phagocytes by apoptotic cells, PtdSer-containing liposomes or an IgM monoclonal anti-PtdSer antibody initiates release of TGFbeta, known to be involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of apoptotic cells.

To address this gap, we developed an unsupervised method to identify internal states from behavioral data and applied it to a dynamic social interaction. During courtship, Drosophila melanogaster males pattern their songs using feedback cues from their partner. Our model uncovers three latent states underlying this behavior and is able to predict moment-to-moment variation in song-patterning decisions. These states correspond to different sensorimotor strategies, each of which is characterized by different mappings from feedback cues to song modes. We show that a pair of neurons previously thought to be command neurons for song production are sufficient to drive switching between states. Our results reveal how animals compose behavior from previously unidentified internal states, which is a necessary step for quantitative descriptions of animal behavior that link environmental cues, internal needs, neuronal activity and motor outputs.",2019,"Adam J Calhoun, Jonathan W Pillow, Mala Murthy, Adam J Calhoun, Jonathan W Pillow, Mala Murthy"

apterous Brain Neurons Control Receptivity to Male Courtship in Drosophila Melanogaster Females,28401905,10.1038/srep46242,"Courtship behaviours allow animals to interact and display their qualities before committing to reproduction. In fly courtship, the female decides whether or not to mate and is thought to display receptivity by slowing down to accept the male. Very little is known on the neuronal brain circuitry controlling female receptivity. Here we use genetic manipulation and behavioural studies to identify a novel set of neurons in the brain that controls sexual receptivity in the female without triggering the postmating response. We show that these neurons, defined by the expression of the transcription factor apterous, affect the modulation of female walking speed during courtship. Interestingly, we found that the apterous neurons required for female receptivity are neither doublesex nor fruitless positive suggesting that apterous neurons are not specified by the sex-determination cascade.

A fluctuation contribution to the entropy due to finiteness of random chains is examined. This contribution can be of the same order as its regular part even at the relatively short lengths of subsequences.

One morphological LHN type is broadly tuned and sums input from multiple glomeruli. These neurons have a broader dynamic range than their individual glomerular inputs do. By contrast, a second morphological type is narrowly tuned and receives prominent odor-selective inhibition through both direct and indirect pathways. We show that this wiring scheme confers increased selectivity.

Several studies have shown that the centrosomes of the Drosophila melanogaster central brain neural stem cells are themselves asymmetric, organizing varying levels of pericentriolar material and microtubules. This asymmetry produces one active and one inactive centrosome during interphase. We identify pericentrin-like protein (PLP) as a negative regulator of centrosome maturation and activity. We show that PLP is enriched on the inactive interphase centrosome, where it blocks recruitment of the master regulator of centrosome maturation, Polo kinase. Furthermore, we find that ectopic Centrobin expression influenced PLP levels on the basal centrosome, suggesting it may normally function to regulate PLP. Finally, we conclude that, although asymmetric centrosome maturation is not required for asymmetric cell division, it is required for proper centrosome segregation to the two daughter cells.",2013,"Dorothy A Lerit, Nasser M Rusan, Dorothy A Lerit, Nasser M Rusan"

Caspase levels and execution efficiencies determine the apoptotic potential of the cell,22351928,10.1083/jcb.201107133,"Essentially, all metazoan cells can undergo apoptosis, but some cells are more sensitive than others to apoptotic stimuli. To date, it is unclear what determines the apoptotic potential of the cell. We set up an in vivo system for monitoring and comparing the activity levels of the two main effector caspases in Drosophila melanogaster, Drice and Dcp-1. Both caspases were activated by the apoptosome after irradiation. However, whereas each caspase alone could induce apoptosis, Drice was a more effective inducer of apoptosis than Dcp-1, which instead had a role in establishing the rate of cell death. These functional differences are attributed to their intrinsic properties rather than merely their tissue specificities. Significantly, the levels of the procaspases are directly proportional to their activity levels and play a key role in determining the cell's sensitivity to apoptosis. Finally, we provide evidence for the existence of a cellular execution threshold of caspase activity, which must be reached to induce apoptosis.",2012,"Anat Florentin, Eli Arama, Anat Florentin, Eli Arama"

The heterochromatic members of the family show a reduced CG content and increased variation in DNA sequence. We show that the CG reduction applies broadly to the protein-coding sequences of genes located at the heterochromatin:euchromatin interface, with a very strong correlation between CG content and the distance from centric heterochromatin. We also observe a similar trend in the transition from telomeric heterochromatin to euchromatin.

Despite our analysis, we do not intend this article as a criticism of Bateman; he accomplished his work without modern computational tools, and his approach was groundbreaking emphasizing the significance of fitness variance for sexual selection.

        Results:
      
    

    
      Here we map structurally derived DDIs onto the cellular PPI networks of different organisms and demonstrate that there is a catalog of domain pairs that is used to mediate various interactions in the cell.

Stabilization of a native protein mediated by ligand binding inhibits amyloid formation independently of the aggregation pathway,17004719,10.1021/jm0606488,"The acylphosphatases from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Drosophila melanogaster (Sso AcP and AcPDro2) were previously shown to form amyloid-like aggregates without the need to unfold initially. Inorganic phosphate (Pi), a competitive inhibitor binding specifically to the active site of these proteins, was found to stabilize, upon binding, the native state of AcPDro2 and to inhibit its conversion into amyloid-like fibrils. The inhibitory effect of Pi is suppressed only in a variant in which the Arg residue responsible for Pi binding is mutated. The study on Sso AcP shows that Pi retards both the formation of the initial nativelike oligomers and their subsequent conversion into protofibrils.

Peptidergic vesicles continually transit through resting terminals, but retrograde peptidergic vesicle flux is accessed following activity to rapidly boost neuropeptide content in synaptic boutons. The presence of excess transiting vesicles implies that synaptic neuropeptide stores are limited by the capture of peptidergic vesicles at the terminal, rather than by synthesis in the soma or delivery via the axon. Furthermore, activity-dependent capture from a pool of transiting vesicles provides a nerve terminal-based mechanism for directing distally and slowly generated resources quickly to active synapses.

Interestingly, this specific histone modification is also enriched along the length of the up-regulated Drosophila melanogaster male X chromosome where it plays a vital role in the dosage compensation process.",2005,"Laura Bisoni, Laura Batlle-Morera, Adrian P Bird, Miho Suzuki, Heather A McQueen, Laura Bisoni, Laura Batlle-Morera, Adrian P Bird, Miho Suzuki, Heather A McQueen"
Monoclonal antibodies identify four distinct annelid leukocyte markers,15784291,10.1016/j.dci.2004.10.008,"This paper describes for the first time the production and characterization of a library of monoclonal antibodies (anti-EFCC clones) raised against coelomocyte (leukocyte) markers of Eisenia fetida earthworm. Leukocyte subgroups are components of earthworm innate immunity that require a more precise characterization using immunological markers. Flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and immunoprecipitation analyzed and confirmed the specificity of anti-EFCC clones. Anti-EFCC mAbs revealed different leukocyte subpopulations and various staining patterns on tissues. Two functional assays (e.g. phagocytosis and encapsulation) further characterized EFCC clusters revealing a common coelomocyte marker and three subpopulation-specific markers. No crossreactivity was found on human, mouse, rat or cells from Drosophila melanogaster but immunoreactivity was detected on snail (Planorbarius corneus) tissues. Immunohistochemical results suggest mesodermal origin of all coelomocyte subgroups that agree with classical morphological analyses.",2005,"Péter Engelmann, László Pálinkás, Edwin L Cooper, Péter Németh, Péter Engelmann, László Pálinkás, Edwin L Cooper, Péter Németh"
Protocadherin Celsr3 is crucial in axonal tract development,15778712,10.1038/nn1428,"In the embryonic CNS, the development of axonal tracts is required for the formation of connections and is regulated by multiple genetic and microenvironmental factors. Here we show that mice with inactivation of Celsr3, an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster flamingo (fmi; also known as starry night, stan) that encodes a seven-pass protocadherin, have marked, selective anomalies of several major axonal fascicles, implicating protocadherins in axonal development in the mammalian CNS for the first time. In flies, fmi controls planar cell polarity (PCP) in a frizzled-dependent but wingless-independent manner. The neural phenotype in Celsr3 mutant mice is similar to that caused by inactivation of Fzd3, a member of the frizzled family. Celsr3 and Fzd3 are expressed together during brain development and may act in synergy. Thus, a genetic pathway analogous to the one that controls PCP is key in the development of the axonal blueprint.",2005,"Fadel Tissir, Isabelle Bar, Yves Jossin, Olivier De Backer, Andre M Goffinet, Fadel Tissir, Isabelle Bar, Yves Jossin, Olivier De Backer, Andre M Goffinet"

We have generated transgenic flies expressing a number of GPCRs in the PRCs. Drosophila melanogaster metabotropic glutamate receptor (DmGluRA) expressed by this novel strategy was purified to homogeneity, giving at least 3-fold higher yields than conventional baculovirus expression systems due to the higher membrane content of the PRCs.

As new sequence data emerge, it is increasingly clear that OR primary structure can vary dramatically across phyla. Some chemoreceptors are encoded by genes with little sequence similarity to the prototypical ORs originally isolated in mammals.

      Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) from Aspergillus fumigatus has been demonstrated to be an allergen showing a high degree of homology with phylogenetically distant MnSODs. We describe cloning, production and characterization of MnSODs from different species.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      MnSODs were cloned by PCR, expressed as inclusion body protein in Escherichia coli, purified by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography and characterized.

Changes in the size of the heterochromatic block located to the right of the centromere in the acrocentric 2L can alter the disjunction of this acrocentric, as well as that of the acrocentric of the opposite 2R arm. It is therefore concluded that, in addition to the major pairing site located at the base of arm 2L, the sites located in heterochromatin of the 2R arm also function during meiotic pairing in males. An account is given of the participation of a 2L acrocentric, containing Y-material at the telomeric end, either in pairing with metacentric chromosome 2 or with the X-chromosome, but not with both of them simultaneously. This phenomenon may be due to the spatial relations of pairing sites and the coiling of pairing chromosomes.",1994,"L V OImel'ianchuk, E I Volkova, L V OImel'ianchuk, E I Volkova"

The enzyme is not restricted to a central chromosome axis, but is distributed uniformly throughout the chromosome. During mitosis, the enzyme present in the early prophase chromosome is lost in two stages, following prophase and following anaphase. Overall, 70% of the enzyme leaves the nucleus and diffuses into the cytoplasm. The localization of the enzyme thus correlates with its role in chromosome condensation and segregation.

Mechanical basis of meiotic metaphase arrest,8455723,10.1038/362364a0,"Control of the metaphase to anaphase transition is a central component of cell-cycle regulation. Arrest at either metaphase I or II before fertilization is a common component of oogenesis in many organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster females, this arrest occurs at meiosis I with the chiasmate bivalents tightly massed at the metaphase plate and the nonexchange chromosomes positioned between the plate and the poles on long tapered spindles. Meiosis resumes only after passage through the oviduct. Thus, metaphase arrest defines an important checkpoint in the meiotic cell cycle. We report here that this arrest results from the balancing of chiasmate bivalents at the metaphase plate. Two meiotic mutations, mei-9b and mei-218a4, both of which greatly reduce the frequency of chiasma formation, bypass the metaphase block and allow stage 14 oocytes to finish both meiotic divisions without arrest.

Since neither successive premeiotic and meiotic exchanges, nor negative chromatid interference, can by themselves account for the negative chromosome interference, we conclude that a greater than expected frequency of multiple exchanges actually occurs. We further suggest that negative chromosome interference may be characteristic of all chromosomal regions normally showing very little exchange in relation to physical length.",1979,"R E Denell, D O Keppy, R E Denell, D O Keppy"
A biochemical study of the scarlet eye-color mutant of Drosophila melanogaster,807197,10.1007/BF00486022,"3-Hydroxykynurenine is virtually absent from st larvae but accumulates during adult development in the puparium. Over the period of adult emergence, the accumulated 3-hydroxykynurenine is excreted so that st adults contain none. Larvae of st fed on tryptophan-C-14 medium produce labeled 3-hydroxykynurenine, at a reduced rate, perhaps, compared to wild type. Xanthurenic acid levels in st pupae are similar to those in wild type. Thus the failure of st larvae to accumulate 8-hydroxykynurenine does not seem to be due either to an inability to synthesize this compound or to an excessive rate of its conversion to xanthurenic acid. Rather, it appears that the mechanism of 3-hydroxykynureneine storage during larval life is defective, so that this compound is excreted at an abnormally high rate. The inability of the pigment cells of the eyes of st to synthesize xanthommatin may result form a similar defect in their ability to take up or store 3-hydroxykynurenine.",1975,"A J Howells, R L Ryall, A J Howells, R L Ryall"
Dosage of the maternal effect gene associated with the tumorous-head abnormality in Drosophila melanogaster,4630588,,"The penetrance of tuh-3 observed in the progeny of triploids with two doses of tuh-1 was not statistically different from that occurring in the progeny of their diploid sisters with two doses. A higher penetrance was observed in the progeny of triploids with three doses of tuh-1 than in the progeny of their diploid sisters with two doses. These observations suggest that the maternal effect responsible for increasing the penetrance of tuh-3, the gene causing the tumorous-head abnormality, is caused by a specific gene product of tuh-1, the maternal-effect allele. In addition there is probably a maternal-effect threshold, lying between amounts produced by one and two doses of tuh-1, below which no increased penetrance of tuh-3 is observed.",1972,"R M Siervogel, R M Siervogel"
Genetic change of recombination value in Drosophila melanogaster. I. Artificial selection for high and low recombination and some properties of recombination-modifying genes,4623519,,"A high and low selection line were formed by individual selection of females on the basis of their recombination. In the high line, recombination between Gl and Sb was increased from 14.8 percent to about 30 percent in twelve generations, when a plateau was apparently reached. Realized heritability was 0.12. The absence of a response to selection for low recombination is attributed mainly to genetic random drift, and partially to directional dominance and directional gene frequencies. Natural selection was found to act against increases of recombination above a level of about twenty percent in the measured interval. High recombination tended to be recessive to low recombination. In both selected lines and unselected stocks, intervals proximal to the centromere tended to have a higher recombination variance than distal intervals.",1972,"M G Kidwell, M G Kidwell"

These elements are related to conserved regulatory features of three of the genes, including tissue- and temporal regulation. In the fourth, gene s15, significant alterations in the 5' flanking region may be responsible for its changed temporal regulation in C. capitata. One long intergenic sequence, located in the distal 5' flanking region of gene s18, is homologous to ACE3, a major amplification control element and contains an 80-bp A/T-rich sequence, known to stimulate strong binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in D. melanogaster.

New Cellular Dimensions on Glioblastoma Progression,32548582,10.1177/2633105520923076,"Gliomas are brain tumors originated from glial cells. The most frequent form of glioma is the glioblastoma (GB). This lethal tumor is frequently originated from genetic alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PI3K pathways. Recent results suggest that signaling pathways, other than primary founder mutations, play a central role in GB progression. Some of these signals are depleted by GB cells from healthy neurons via specialized filopodia known as tumor microtubes (TMs). Here, we discuss the contribution of TMs to vampirize wingless/WNT ligand from neurons. In consequence, wingless/WNT pathway is upregulated in GB to promote tumor progression, and the reduction of these signals in neurons causes the reduction of synapse number and neurodegeneration. These processes contribute to neurological defects and premature death.",2020,"Marta Portela, Sergio Casas-Tintó, Marta Portela, Sergio Casas-Tintó"

In mouse oocytes, stable microtubule end-on attachments to kinetochores are not established until hours after spindle assembly, and phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C is responsible for the delay. Here we demonstrated that microtubule ends are actively prevented from stable attachment to kinetochores until well after spindle formation in Drosophila melanogaster oocytes. We identified the microtubule catastrophe-promoting complex Sentin-EB1 as a major factor responsible for this delay. Without this activity, microtubule ends precociously form robust attachments to kinetochores in oocytes, leading to a high proportion of homologous kinetochores stably attached to the same pole.

Still, the mechanism responsible for maintaining myonuclear architecture, and its importance, is currently elusive.

Together, they form a flexible perinuclear shield that protects myonuclei from intrinsic or extrinsic forces. The loss of this scaffold resulted in significantly aberrant nuclear morphology and subsequently reduced levels of essential nuclear factors such as lamin A/C, lamin B, and HP1. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism for maintaining myonuclear morphology and reveal its critical link to correct levels of nuclear factors in differentiated muscle fibers.

Sensitization, i.e., increment in response intensity upon stimulus repetition, occurs in a state dependent manner for proximal stimuli that make direct contact with the body. In Pavlovian conditioning paradigms, the unconditioned stimulus (US) is always a more proximal stimulus than the conditioned stimulus (CS). The mechanisms of associative and non-associative learning are not independent. CS-US pairings lead to formation of associations if sensitizing modulation from a proximal US prevents the habituation for a distal anticipatory CS.",2014,"Münire Özlem Cevik, Münire Özlem Cevik"
Calpain A modulates Toll responses by limited Cactus/IκB proteolysis,23864715,10.1091/mbc.E13-02-0113,"Calcium-dependent cysteine proteases of the calpain family are modulatory proteases that cleave their substrates in a limited manner. Among their substrates, calpains target vertebrate and invertebrate IκB proteins. Because proteolysis by calpains potentially generates novel protein functions, it is important to understand how this affects NFκB activity. We investigate the action of Calpain A (CalpA) on the Drosophila melanogaster IκB homologue Cactus in vivo. CalpA alters the absolute amounts of Cactus protein. Our data indicate, however, that CalpA uses additional mechanisms to regulate NFκB function. We provide evidence that CalpA interacts physically with Cactus, recognizing a Cactus pool that is not bound to Dorsal, a fly NFκB/Rel homologue. We show that proteolytic cleavage by CalpA generates Cactus fragments lacking an N-terminal region required for Toll responsiveness. These fragments are generated in vivo and display properties distinct from those of full-length Cactus.

When not to copy: female fruit flies use sophisticated public information to avoid mated males,23105967,10.1038/srep00768,"Semen limitation (lack of semen to fertilize all of a female's eggs) imposes high fitness costs to female partners. Females should therefore avoid mating with semen-limited males. This can be achieved by using public information extracted from watching individual males' previous copulating activities. This adaptive preference should be flexible given that semen limitation is temporary. We first demonstrate that the number of offspring produced by males Drosophila melanogaster gradually decreases over successive copulations. We then show that females avoid mating with males they just watched copulating and that visual public cues are sufficient to elicit this response. Finally, after males were given the time to replenish their sperm reserves, females did not avoid the males they previously saw copulating anymore. These results suggest that female fruit flies may have evolved sophisticated behavioural processes of resistance to semen-limited males, and demonstrate unsuspected adaptive context-dependent mate choice in an invertebrate.",2012,"Adeline Loyau, Simon Blanchet, Pauline Van Laere, Jean Clobert, Etienne Danchin, Adeline Loyau, Simon Blanchet, Pauline Van Laere, Jean Clobert, Etienne Danchin"

PABP and the poly(A) tail augment microRNA repression by facilitated miRISC binding,22635249,10.1038/nsmb.2309,"Polyadenylated mRNAs are typically more strongly repressed by microRNAs (miRNAs) than their nonadenylated counterparts.

These findings are mechanistically explained by a notable function of PABP: it promotes association of miRISC with miRNA-regulated mRNAs. We also found that PABP association with mRNA rapidly diminished with miRISC recruitment and before detectable deadenylation. We integrated these data into a revised model for the function of PABP and the poly(A) tail in miRNA-mediated translational repression.",2012,"Francesca Moretti, Constanze Kaiser, Agnieszka Zdanowicz-Specht, Matthias W Hentze, Francesca Moretti, Constanze Kaiser, Agnieszka Zdanowicz-Specht, Matthias W Hentze"

SHY is intuitively appealing because it relates the homeostatic regulation of sleep to an important function (synaptic plasticity). SHY has also received important experimental support from recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster. There remain, however, a number of unanswered questions about SHY. What is the cellular mechanism governing SHY? How does it fit with what we know about plasticity mechanisms in the brain?

We report the use of artificial selection to demonstrate heritable variation in the fluctuating asymmetry of interlandmark distances within the wing in an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our estimates for the heritability of FA range from 0% to 1% and result in estimates for the heritability of DI as large as 20%, comparable to values typical for life-history traits. These values indicate the existence of evolutionarily relevant genetic variation for DI and the effectiveness of selection for reduced FA suggests that natural selection has not fixed all the genetic variants that would improve developmental stability in these populations.",2011,"Ashley J R Carter, David Houle, Ashley J R Carter, David Houle"

Invertebrate p53 superfamily members appear to have a p63-like domain structure, which seems to be evolutionarily ancient. The radiation into p53, p63, and p73 proteins is a vertebrate invention. In invertebrate models amenable to genetic analysis p53 superfamily members mainly act in apoptosis regulation in response to genotoxic agents and do not have overt developmental functions. We summarize the literature on cnidarian and mollusc p53 superfamily members and focus on the function and regulation of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans p53 superfamily members in triggering apoptosis. Furthermore, we examine the emerging evidence showing that invertebrate p53 superfamily proteins also have functions unrelated to apoptosis, such as DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint responses, compensatory proliferation, aging, autophagy, and innate immunity.",2010,"Rachael Rutkowski, Kay Hofmann, Anton Gartner, Rachael Rutkowski, Kay Hofmann, Anton Gartner"
Transfers of mitochondrial DNA to the nuclear genome in the wasp Nasonia vitripennis,20167015,10.1111/j.1365-2583.2009.00932.x,"Many organisms carry nuclear sequences of mitochondrial origin (NUMTs). We have identified 76 NUMTs in 25 genomic locations in the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis. The total amount of NUMTs in Nasonia is 42 972 bp exceeding over four-fold that found in Tribolium castaneum and almost fifty-fold that found in Drosophila melanogaster, whereas Apis mellifera has an even larger number of NUMTs in its genome (over 230 kb). The Nasonia NUMTs were inserted by multiple independent events and frequently involved large fragments spanning multiple mitochondrial genes. Most of the NUMTs are recent transfers that occurred less than one million years ago after the speciation of N. vitripennis. Duplications and rearrangements in the nucleus have also occurred.

Ana3 is a conserved protein required for the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies,19948479,10.1083/jcb.200905031,"Recent studies have identified a conserved ""core"" of proteins that are required for centriole duplication. A small number of additional proteins have recently been identified as potential duplication factors, but it is unclear whether any of these proteins are components of the core duplication machinery. In this study, we investigate the function of one of these proteins, Drosophila melanogaster Ana3. We show that Ana3 is present in centrioles and basal bodies, but its behavior is distinct from that of the core duplication proteins. Most importantly, we find that Ana3 is required for the structural integrity of both centrioles and basal bodies and for centriole cohesion, but it is not essential for centriole duplication. We show that Ana3 has a mammalian homologue, Rotatin, that also localizes to centrioles and basal bodies and appears to be essential for cilia function. Thus, Ana3 defines a conserved family of centriolar proteins and plays an important part in ensuring the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies.",2009,"Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Alan Wainman, Fanni Gergely, Jordan W Raff, Naomi R Stevens, Jeroen Dobbelaere, Alan Wainman, Fanni Gergely, Jordan W Raff"

Demonstrated and inferred metabolism associated with cytosolic lipid droplets,19696439,10.1194/jlr.R001446,"Cytosolic lipid droplets were considered until recently to be rather inert particles of stored neutral lipid. Largely through proteomics is it now known that droplets are dynamic organelles and that they participate in several important metabolic reactions as well as trafficking and interorganellar communication. In this review, the role of droplets in metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fly Drosophila melanogaster, and several mammalian sources are discussed, particularly focusing on those reactions shared by these organisms. From proteomics and older work, it is clear that droplets are important for fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis, fatty acid activation, and lipolysis. However, many droplet-associated enzymes are predicted to span a membrane two or more times, which suggests either that droplet structure is more complex than the current model posits, or that there are tightly bound membranes, particularly derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, which account for the association of several of these proteins.",2009,"Joel M Goodman, Joel M Goodman"
"Evidence for metabolic provisioning by a common invertebrate endosymbiont, Wolbachia pipientis, during periods of nutritional stress",19343208,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000368,"Wolbachia are ubiquitous inherited endosymbionts of invertebrates that invade host populations by modifying host reproductive systems. However, some strains lack the ability to impose reproductive modification and yet are still capable of successfully invading host populations. To explain this paradox, theory predicts that such strains should provide a fitness benefit, but to date none has been detected. Recently completed genome sequences of different Wolbachia strains show that these bacteria may have the genetic machinery to influence iron utilization of hosts. Here we show that Wolbachia infection can confer a positive fecundity benefit for Drosophila melanogaster reared on iron-restricted or -overloaded diets. Furthermore, iron levels measured from field-collected flies indicated that nutritional conditions in the field were overall comparable to those of flies reared in the laboratory on restricted diets.

Applying the genetic theories of ageing to the cytoplasm: cytoplasmic genetic covariation for fitness and lifespan,19226414,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01692.x,"Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Under MA, a reduced intensity of selection with age results in accumulation of late-acting deleterious mutations. Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Recent studies suggest that the mitochondrial genome is a major player in ageing. It therefore seems plausible that the MA and AP models will be relevant to genomes within the cytoplasm. This possibility has not been considered previously. We explore whether patterns of covariation between fitness and ageing across 25 cytoplasmic lines, sampled from a population of Drosophila melanogaster, are consistent with the genetic associations predicted under MA or AP. We find negative covariation for fitness and the rate of ageing, and positive covariation for fitness and lifespan.

SMG6 promotes endonucleolytic cleavage of nonsense mRNA in human cells,19060897,10.1038/nsmb.1530,"From yeast to humans, mRNAs harboring premature termination codons (PTCs) are recognized and degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, degradation mechanisms of NMD have been suggested to differ between species. In Drosophila melanogaster, NMD is initiated by endonucleolysis near the PTC, whereas in yeast and human cells the current view posits that NMD occurs by exonucleolysis from one or both RNA termini. Here we report that degradation of human nonsense mRNAs can be initiated by PTC-proximal endonucleolytic cleavage. We identify the metazoan-specific NMD factor SMG6 as the responsible endonuclease by demonstrating that mutation of conserved residues in its nuclease domain--the C-terminal PIN motif--abolishes endonucleolysis in vivo and in vitro. Our data lead to a revised mechanistic model for degradation of nonsense mRNA in human cells and suggest that endonucleolytic cleavage is a conserved feature in metazoan NMD.",2009,"Andrea B Eberle, Søren Lykke-Andersen, Oliver Mühlemann, Torben Heick Jensen, Andrea B Eberle, Søren Lykke-Andersen, Oliver Mühlemann, Torben Heick Jensen"

Here we use theory and simulation to investigate a separate demographic effect-that of founder events involving multiply mated females-and find that it leads to much stronger reductions in X/A diversity ratios than are produced by simple population size changes. Investigating the potential of this process to account for sharply reduced X-linked diversity in European Drosophila melanogaster, we find that this model yields predictions that are compatible with the empirical data.",2008,"John E Pool, Rasmus Nielsen, John E Pool, Rasmus Nielsen"
Intercalary heterochromatin in polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster,18491121,10.1007/s00412-008-0163-7,"Intercalary heterochromatin consists of extended chromosomal domains which are interspersed throughout the euchromatin and contain silent genetic material. These domains comprise either clusters of functionally unrelated genes or tandem gene duplications and possibly stretches of noncoding sequences. Strong repression of genetic activity means that intercalary heterochromatin displays properties that are normally attributable to classic pericentric heterochromatin: high compaction, late replication and underreplication in polytene chromosomes, and the presence of heterochromatin-specific proteins. Late replication and underreplication occurs when the suppressor of underreplication protein is present in intercalary heterochromatic regions. Intercalary heterochromatin underreplication in polytene chromosomes results in free double-stranded ends of DNA molecules; ligation of these free ends is the most likely mechanism for ectopic pairing between intercalary heterochromatic and pericentric heterochromatic regions.

Influence of semicrystalline order on the second-harmonic generation efficiency in the anisotropic bands of myocytes,17356630,10.1364/ao.46.001852,The influence of semicrystalline order on the second-harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in the anisotropic bands of Drosophila melanogaster sarcomeres from larval and adult muscle has been investigated. Differences in the semicrystalline order were obtained by using wild-type and mutant strains containing different amounts of headless myosin. The reduction in semicrystalline order without altering the chemical composition of myofibrils was achieved by observing highly stretched sarcomeres and by inducing a loss of viability in myocytes. In all cases the reduction of semicrystalline order in anisotropic bands of myocytes resulted in a substantial decrease in SHG. Second-harmonic imaging during periodic contractions of myocytes revealed higher intensities when sarcomeres were in the relaxed state compared with the contracted state. This study demonstrates that an ordered semicrystalline arrangement of anisotropic bands plays a determining role in the efficiency of SHG in myocytes.,2007,"Catherine Greenhalgh, Nicole Prent, Chantal Green, Richard Cisek, Arkady Major, Bryan Stewart, Virginijus Barzda, Catherine Greenhalgh, Nicole Prent, Chantal Green, Richard Cisek, Arkady Major, Bryan Stewart, Virginijus Barzda"

Furthermore, in a double mutant of PR-Set7 and mei-41 (the fly ATR orthologue), the abnormalities of mitotic progression and the cyclin B protein level were rescued. PR-Set7 also showed a defect in chromosome condensation that was enhanced in the double mutant.

Together with L-glutamate-gated chloride channels, which are important targets of known parasiticides, and acetylcholine-gated chloride channels, these new classes of ligand-gated chloride channels, which are known only from invertebrates, add to our understanding of inhibitory neural signalling.

Effects of mild heat shocks at young age on aging and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster,11708717,10.1023/a:1011561107055,"Young adult flies were submitted to heat shocks (37 degrees C) of various durations (5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 min daily) for 1, 2 or 3 weeks. A slight longevity increase, in both sexes, was only observed with the lowest heat shock. Longer shocks had neutral or negative effects. Flies submitted to the procedure providing a longevity increase did not show a delayed behavioral aging but survived longer at 37 degrees C than control flies. This higher thermotolerance was not associated with an increased hsp70 induction. The results are discussed in connection with hormesis and previous results showing that hypergravity, an other mild stress, increases longevity and delays behavioral aging: different mild stresses may have contrasting effects on aging and longevity.",2001,"E Le Bourg, P Valenti, P Lucchetta, F Payre, E Le Bourg, P Valenti, P Lucchetta, F Payre"
Phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of cyclin E by the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase,11533444,10.1126/science.1065203,"Cyclin E binds and activates the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 and catalyzes the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle. The amount of cyclin E protein present in the cell is tightly controlled by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Here we identify the ubiquitin ligase responsible for cyclin E ubiquitination as SCFFbw7 and demonstrate that it is functionally conserved in yeast, flies, and mammals. Fbw7 associates specifically with phosphorylated cyclin E, and SCFFbw7 catalyzes cyclin E ubiquitination in vitro. Depletion of Fbw7 leads to accumulation and stabilization of cyclin E in vivo in human and Drosophila melanogaster cells. Multiple F-box proteins contribute to cyclin E stability in yeast, suggesting an overlap in SCF E3 ligase specificity that allows combinatorial control of cyclin E degradation.",2001,"D M Koepp, L K Schaefer, X Ye, K Keyomarsi, C Chu, J W Harper, S J Elledge, D M Koepp, L K Schaefer, X Ye, K Keyomarsi, C Chu, J W Harper, S J Elledge"

The ski gene encodes an apparent acyltransferase, and we provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Hh proteins from ski mutant cells retain carboxyl-terminal cholesterol modification but lack amino-terminal palmitate modification. Our results suggest that ski encodes an enzyme that acts within the secretory pathway to catalyze amino-terminal palmitoylation of Hh, and further demonstrate that this lipid modification is required for the embryonic and larval patterning activities of the Hh signal.",2001,"Z Chamoun, R K Mann, D Nellen, D P von Kessler, M Bellotto, P A Beachy, K Basler, Z Chamoun, R K Mann, D Nellen, D P von Kessler, M Bellotto, P A Beachy, K Basler"
Comparative insect developmental genetics: phenotypes without mutants,11340618,10.1002/bies.1055,"The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in interest in the extent to which morphological evolution depends on changes in regulatory pathways. Insects provide a fertile ground for study because of their diversity and our high level of understanding of the genetic regulation of development in Drosophila melanogaster. However, comparable genetic approaches are presently possible in only a small number of non-Drosophilid insects. In a recent paper, Hughes and Kaufman have used a new methodology, RNA interference, in the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, to phenocopy the effects of mutations in Hox genes. RNA interference involves the injection of double-stranded RNA of the same sequence as the relevant mRNA resulting in a depletion of that transcript. Hughes and Kaufman focused on the gnathal segments, which elaborate specialized appendages important to feeding. Their results indicate that gnathal adaptations in this bug are correlated with changes in Hox gene functions and interactions.",2001,"R Denell, T Shippy, R Denell, T Shippy"

The first system uses a sex-specific promoter or enhancer to drive the expression of a repressible transcription factor, which in turn controls the expression of a toxic gene product. The second system uses non-sex-specific expression of the repressible transcription factor to regulate a selectively lethal gene product.

The Hsp70 heat-shock gene family of the mosquito Anopheles albimanus,9087548,10.1111/j.1365-2583.1993.tb00130.x,Four Hsp70 genes of the malaria vector Anopheles albimanus were isolated from a genomic DNA library as two non-overlapping clones each containing a pair of divergently transcribed genes having 75% DNA sequence similarity to the protein-coding regions of the Drosophila melanogaster Hsp70 genes. The clones were assigned to two loci on chromosome 2R by in situ hybridization. These clones hybridize strongly to heat-shock but only weakly to non-shocked mosquito RNA. The Hsp70 gene family of A. albimanus is undergoing concerted evolution probably by gene conversion.

The steroid hormones, the ecdysteroids, are involved in two aspects of this death. Ecdysteroid action early in metamorphosis is somehow essential for fixing the fates of the neurons that will die. The actual triggering of their death, however, occurs a few weeks later and requires the withdrawal of the steroid and, at least in some cases, a trans-synaptic signal. These ""execution"" events involve both RNA and protein synthesis and result in the onset of degeneration about 10 h later. The early ""decision"" of a neuron to opt for the degeneration fate is associated with an altered pattern of ecdysteroid receptor expression.

To address the mechanisms underlying these oscillatory phenomena, we have analyzed RNA and protein cycling from two per-beta-galactosidase fusion genes. These studies demonstrate that 5' noncoding sequences from per are sufficient to cause the fusion mRNA levels to cycle in a wild-type (rhythmic) background.

The present study tests whether this divergence could be attributed to the epistatic mechanism assumed by Wright's shifting-balance model of evolution, in which alleles favored in the genetic background of one population are not favored in that of another. If this were the mechanism of divergence, crosses between selected lines from different populations would be expected to yield an epistatic loss of the selected phenotype. However, all such crosses showed a good fit to an additive model with dominance. Divergence by an epistatic mechanism may also be associated with epistatic variance within populations, but no evidence for such epistasis was found. The populations therefore appear to have responded in different ways to selection not because of epistasis but because knockdown-resistance alleles that were common in some populations were absent (or at least less common) in others.",1989,"Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley, Frederick M Cohan, Ary A Hoffmann, Todd W Gayley"

Since the morphs varied concordantly in their activities on numerous alcohols, and since aging and heat treatment experiments failed to reveal a stability difference, it is proposed that the difference is regulatory in nature, affecting ADH synthesis and primarily cisacting. A survey of wild flies revealed additional variation in the FF/SS activity ratio. Further genetic analysis showed that the basis of this variation is not restricted to the second chromosome. Furthermore, modification of the activity ratio implies some degree of allelespecificity on the part of the modifiers.",1980,"A Grossman, A Grossman"

[Heterochromatin and chromosomal polymorphism],109749,,"The structure and sizes of different short deletions of Drosophila melanogaster X-chromosome: left break in the region of locus y-ac-sc, right break in different parts of the heterochromatic region (HR) near the centromere, of the nuclei of salivary glands and metaphases of oogonia were compared. It is suggested, that the development of large blocks of deoxynucleoproteins by a small number of loci of the HR, observed in mitotic chromosomes, is due to their ability to undergo additional replication, as it previously has been shown for locus bobbed. HR in human chromosomes provide high polymorphism of the chromosome sets. The same chromosome can appear in several varieties within a population. The varieties differ in sizes of the HR and their ability for intensive fluorescence. The appearance of these heredical varieties are conditioned by deletions, duplications and inversions in the HR. Studies on revealing boundaries between normal and pathological HR polymorphism of human chromosomes are in progress.",1977,"A A Prokof'eva-Bel'govskaia, A A Prokof'eva-Bel'govskaia"
Isolation and characterization of X-linked lethal mutants affecting differentiation of the imaginal discs in Drosophila melanogaster,24413794,10.1007/BF00281284,"Twenty-seven late larval or early pupal lethal mutations were isolated for the X-chromosome, some of which showed structural and/or functional deficiencies of the imaginal discs. The mutants were grouped according to the size and morphology of their discs as follows: 1. discs normal: 18 mutants. 2. discs small: 2 mutants. 3. discs degenerate: 4 mutants. 4. discless: 1 mutant. 5. discs heterogeneous: 2 mutants. Preliminary characterization of the mutants included a study of disc morphology, puparium formation and pupal molt, in vivo and in vitro evagination of the imaginal discs, autonomy of the mutation in the disc tissue (differentiation after transplantation and gynander mosaicism test). Possible relations between disc morphology and the former characteristics are discussed.",1976,"I Kiss, G Bencze, E Fekete, A Fodor, J Gausz, P Maróy, J Szabad, J Szidonya, I Kiss, G Bencze, E Fekete, A Fodor, J Gausz, P Maróy, J Szabad, J Szidonya"
