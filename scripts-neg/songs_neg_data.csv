In vivo interactions of RNA polymerase II with genes of Drosophila melanogaster,3018544,10.1128/mcb.5.8.2009,"We describe a method for examining the in vivo distribution of a protein on specific eucaryotic DNA sequences. In this method, proteins are cross-linked to DNA in intact cells, and the protein-DNA adducts are isolated by immunoprecipitation with antiserum against the protein. Characterization of the DNA cross-linked to the precipitated protein identifies the sequences with which the protein is associated in vivo. Here, we applied these methods to detect RNA polymerase II-DNA interactions in heat-shocked and untreated Drosophila melanogaster Schneider line 2 cells. The level of RNA polymerase II associated with several heat shock genes increased dramatically in response to heat shock, whereas the level associated with the copia genes decreased, indicating that both induction of heat shock gene expression and repression of the copia gene expression by heat shock occur at the transcriptional level. Low levels of RNA polymerase II were present on DNA outside of the transcription units, and for at least two genes, hsp83 and hsp26, RNA polymerase II initiated binding near the transcription start site. Moreover, for hsp70, the density of RNA polymerase II on sequences downstream of the polyadenylate addition site was much lower than that observed on the gene internal sequences. Examination of the amount of specific restriction fragments cross-linked to RNA polymerase II provides a means of detecting RNA polymerase II on individual members of multigene families. This analysis shows that RNA polymerase II is associated with only one of the two cytoplasmic actin genes.",1985,"D S Gilmour, J T Lis, D S Gilmour, J T Lis"
A small region on the X chromosome of Drosophila regulates a key gene that controls sex determination and dosage compensation,3931920,10.1016/0092-8674(85)90284-3,"In Drosophila, flies with two X chromosomes are females, with one X chromosome, males. We investigated the presence of sex determining factors on the X chromosome by constructing genotypes with one X and various X-chromosomal duplications. We found that female determining factors are not evenly distributed along the X chromosome as had been previously postulated. A distal duplication covering 35% of the X chromosome promotes female differentiation, a much larger proximal duplication of 60% results in male differentiation. The strong feminizing effect of distal duplications originates from a small segment that, when present in two doses, activates Sxl, a key gene for sex determination and dosage compensation. Our results suggest that Sxl can be activated to intermediate levels.",1985,"M Steinmann-Zwicky, R Nöthiger, M Steinmann-Zwicky, R Nöthiger"
An ecdysterone-responsive puff site in Drosophila contains a cluster of seven differentially regulated genes,3090270,10.1016/s0022-2836(86)80002-x,"We have determined the molecular organization of an ecdysterone-responsive puff site in Drosophila melanogaster. The 71E puff site contains a tightly linked cluster of at least seven genes within a neighborhood of 10 X 10(3) base-pairs. All the genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in either the larval or the prepupal salivary gland. However, these genes can be divided into two groups on the basis of their temporal pattern of transcription. Six of the genes are expressed only in prepupal salivary glands and are arranged as three divergently transcribed pairs. Nestled within this region is one gene expressed primarily in late third-instar salivary glands. We conclude that this developmentally complex puff site contains six members of the ecdysterone-induced ""late""-gene set and one member of the ecdysterone-regulated ""intermolt"" -gene set. Additional complexity is found at the transcript level: a heterogeneously sized population of RNA molecules arises from each of the seven genes.",1986,"L L Restifo, G M Guild, L L Restifo, G M Guild"
Histochemical analysis of the ecdysterone-regulated expression of the Drosophila genes P1 and LSP-2,3453783,10.1002/dvg.1020070405,"3H-labeled DNA probes for the ecdysterone-inducible Drosophila genes P1 and LSP-2 were hybridized in situ to RNA in sections of embryos and larvae. Intense hybridization was detected specifically in fat body cells of third-instar larvae and not in other cells of third-instar larvae nor in any cells at earlier stages. These results confirm the stringent tissue- and stage-specificity of P1 and LSP-2 expression. Hybridization of both probes occurred to virtually all the cells in the fat bodies, indicating that both genes are expressed in the same cells. Since P1 expression begins several hours later than LSP-2 expression, and appears to be induced directly by ecdysterone, this finding implies that one or more of the fat body components mediating the response to ecdysterone is gene-specific.",1986,"M L Paco-Larson, Y Nakanishi, M Levine, A Garen, M L Paco-Larson, Y Nakanishi, M Levine, A Garen"

Expression of a new beta tubulin subunit is induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in Drosophila cultured cells,3080985,10.1016/0006-291x(86)90546-2,"One polypeptide, P4, of molecular weight 55000 daltons and pHi, 5,1, is synthesized in Drosophila melanogaster Kc 0% cells only when they were treated by the insect moulting hormone, 20 hydroxyecdysone (20-HE). P4 is precipitated with vinblastine sulfate and migrates as a tubulin subunit. Immunoblot experiment confirms that P4 is a beta subunit of tubulin. This beta tubulin is recovered by in vitro translation only when mRNAs are extracted from treated cells. Thus, regulation of expression of this polypeptide is at the level of transcripts and is under a steroid hormone control.

Here we clarify the role of da+ in Drosophila development, finding: this sex determination gene is indeed pleiotropic; zygotic functioning of da+ is essential in both sexes for somatic cell development, but not for germ cell development; da female sterility results from a somatic, rather than germ-line, defect; and expression of da+ in the maternal germ line is required only for daughters in the subsequent generation, as expected for a specific regulator of Sxl+. These conclusions follow from the characterization of new da null alleles isolated by a selection for defects in maternally acting positive regulators of Sxl.",1987,"C Cronmiller, T W Cline, C Cronmiller, T W Cline"
A Comprehensive Study of Genic Variation in Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster. III. Variations in Genetic Structure and Their Causes between Drosophila melanogaster and Its Sibling Species Drosophila simulans,17246411,,"The natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans were compared for their genetic structure. A total of 114 gene-protein loci were studied in four mainland (from Europe and Africa) and an island (Seychelle) populations of D. simulans and the results were compared with those obtained on the same set of homologous loci in fifteen worldwide populations of D. melanogaster. The main results are as follows: (1) D. melanogaster shows a significantly higher proportion of loci polymorphic than D. simulans (52% vs. 39%, P<0.05), (2) both species have similar mean heterozygosity and mean number of alleles per locus, (3) the two species share some highly polymorphic loci but they do not share loci that show high geographic differentiation, and (4) D. simulans shows significantly less geographic differentiation than D. melanogaster. The differences in genetic differentiation between the two species are limited to loci located on the X and second chromosomes only; loci on the third chromosome show similar level of geographic differentiation in both species. These two species have previously been shown to differ in their pattern of variation for chromosomal polymorphisms, quantitative and physiological characters, two-dimensional electrophoretic (2DE) proteins, middle repetitive DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Variation in niche-widths and/or genetic ""strategies"" of adaptation appear to be the main causes of differences in the genetic structure of these two species.",1987,"M Choudhary, R S Singh, M Choudhary, R S Singh"
[Transposition bursts in analysis of repeated mutations in unstable strains of Drosophila melanogaster],2840340,,"The phenomenon of transposition memory was earlier demonstrated for the cut locus and mdg4. This work has been aimed at finding out, in what way the transposition memory can be realized. An unstable stock cmMR17ctMRpN17 was analysed which had high frequency of double cm+ct+ reversions and cmMRctMRpN repeated mutations. A series of five such transpositions could be followed. The ctMRpN17 mutation is a result of insertion at the cut locus mdg4 with the jockey element inserted within it. As seen from in situ hybridization analysis, transitions to the normal phenotype correlate, as a rule, with the excision of mdg4 and the jockey from the cut locus. Analysis of distribution of mdg1, mdg2, mdg3 and jockey on the X-chromosome of unstable revertants and repeated mutants indicated that not only transpositions of mdg4 and jockey, but also those of all mobile elements tested occur. So, we propose that the transposition memory in our genetic system is manifested in the process of transposition bursts.",1988,"E Z Kochieva, T I Gerasimova, E Z Kochieva, T I Gerasimova"
Intermicrotubular actin filaments in the transalar cytoskeletal arrays of Drosophila,3151490,,"Rabbit muscle myosin subfragment S1 decorates 6 nm diameter filaments in Drosophila wing epidermal cells in the arrowhead fashion characteristic of the binding of subfragment S1 to actin filaments. The filaments in question are concentrated between microtubules that are mostly composed of 15 protofilaments and form cell surface-associated transcellular bundles. There are indications that the majority of the actin filaments have the same polarity and that, like the microtubules, they may elongate from sites at the apical surfaces of the cells. The bundles of F actin and microtubules occur in dorsal and ventral epidermal cell layers of a wing blade. They are joined in dorso-ventral pairs by attachment desmosomes. These transalar cytoskeletal arrays may provide an example of a situation where actin filaments operate as stiffeners rather than active generators of force in conjunction with myosin. The arrays probably function as noncontractile pillars to maintain basal cell extensions and keep haemocoelic spaces open in the highly folded and expanding wing blades of late pupae.",1988,"M M Mogensen, J B Tucker, M M Mogensen, J B Tucker"
Reproductive behavior of Drosophila melanogaster and D. nigrospiracula in the field and in the laboratory,3135147,10.1037/0735-7036.102.2.169,"The reproductive behaviors of two species of fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster and D. nigrospiracula, were compared in field and laboratory populations.

D. melanogaster, which was observed on citrus, mates at its feeding site, whereas D. nigrospiracula, which is cactiphilic, mates on a non-resource-based male territory adjacent to its feeding site. In both species large male size is important for reproductive success. However, in D. melanogaster smaller males tended to be excluded from the breeding site and were therefore not among the pool of potential mates to which females were exposed. Sex ratios were biased toward females in both species, but the high frequency of female remating in D. nigrospiracula may have provided more mating opportunities for the males of this species. Field observations differed from laboratory observations, and I discuss the importance of these differences for understanding the evolution of Drosophila mating systems.",1988,"T A Markow, T A Markow"
Genetic analysis of larval competition in Drosophila melanogaster,3147977,10.1038/hdy.1988.124,"A chromosome assay was employed to determine the genetic basis of the competitive ability of the larvae of Drosophila melanogaster when competing for a controlled amount of food. The effects of increasing stress due to intra- and inter-genotypic competition were analysed using a yield-density regression analysis producing estimates of the absolute performance at a standard reference density (e-values), the magnitude of intra-genotypic competition and the inter-genotypic competitive effect of one genotype on another. A distinction was made between the Sensitivity and the Pressure components of inter-genotypic competition. The probability of survival and mean adult weight were used as measures of competitive success. The genetic analysis revealed high levels of heterosis for the e-values and inter-genotypic pressure, with correspondingly high inter-chromosomal interactions. Inter-genotypic sensitivity was less consistently heterotic and less epistatic. All dominance was directed towards a competitively superior genotype and both major autosomes were involved in the determination of competitive ability with the greater effect residing on the third chromosome. There was evidence of early non-competitive larval mortality in one of the two sets of substitution lines investigated and the effect of this on the estimation of the genetic parameters is discussed.",1988,"J R de Miranda, P Eggleston, J R de Miranda, P Eggleston"

Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences among lines in stored lipids and carbohydrates, as well as in activities of most of the enzymes. Significant broad-sense genetic correlations (among adjusted line means) were detected for a number of enzyme pairs. Multiple regression techniques were applied to assess the extent to which the amounts of stored triacylglycerols and carbohydrates could be predicted from the enzyme activities. Significant regressions were found in both adults and larvae, suggesting that modulation of enzyme activities is reflected in different sizes of storage pools. The population genetic consequences of natural selection acting on a phenotype such as energy storage is considered in light of models of metabolic flux in biochemical pathways.",1988,"A G Clark, L E Keith, A G Clark, L E Keith"
A Drosophila rRNA gene located in euchromatin is active in transcription and nucleolus formation,3149250,10.1101/gad.2.12b.1745,"P-element transformants of a single rRNA gene (rDNA) were used to investigate the relationship between the organization of the nucleolus organizer (NO) and rDNA function in Drosophila melanogaster. In situ hybridization to rRNA in polytene nuclei of salivary glands demonstrated that an rRNA gene can be transcribed at a high rate when inserted into chromosomal sites other than the NO. Structures that resemble morphologically the endogenous nucleoli ('mininucleoli') were associated with four different euchromatic sites of rDNA insertion. Molecular analyses revealed that these mininucleoli contained both rRNA and an antigen specific to nucleoli. Phenotypes resulting from rDNA deficiencies were rescued partially by the presence of the transformed rDNA, indicating that the transcripts and mininucleoli associated with the rDNA insertion sites were functional. Thus, two conserved features of rDNA organization in eukaryotes, namely tandem repetition and heterochromatic localization, are not required for rRNA gene function. We conclude that 'nucleolar organizing activity' is an intrinsic property of the rDNA or its RNA products.",1988,"G H Karpen, J E Schaefer, C D Laird, G H Karpen, J E Schaefer, C D Laird"
Molecular basis for the regulation of cell fate by the lethal (2) giant larvae tumour suppressor gene of Drosophila melanogaster,2545420,10.1002/9780470513750.ch11,"Tumour suppressor genes act as recessive determinants of cancer.

In Drosophila, a series of genes have been identified which when mutated produce tissue-specific tumours. Of these the lethal(2)giant larvae (l(2)gl) gene is the best studied. Homozygous l(2)gl mutations cause the development of malignant tumours in the brain and the imaginal discs. Genomic DNA from the l(2)gl locus has been cloned, introduced back into l(2)gl mutant animals by P-element-mediated transformation and shown to restore normal development. The nucleotide sequence of the l(2)gl gene (13.1 kb) has been determined, as well as the sequences of the two classes of transcripts. These transcripts encode two polypeptides of 127 kDa and 78 kDa, respectively. Both proteins have been immunologically identified. Analyses of the spatial distribution of both l(2)gl transcripts and proteins revealed that during early embryogenesis the l(2)gl gene is uniformly expressed in all cells and tissues. In late embryos, the l(2)gl expression becomes gradually restricted to tissues presenting no morphological or neoplastic alteration in the mutant animals. Further mosaic experiments pointed out that the critical period for the establishment of tumorigenesis is limited to early embryogenesis at a time when the l(2)gl expression is most intense in all cells.",1989,"B M Mechler, I Török, M Schmidt, M Opper, A Kuhn, R Merz, U Protin, B M Mechler, I Török, M Schmidt, M Opper, A Kuhn, R Merz, U Protin"
Modality-specific axonal projections in the CNS of the flies Phormia and Drosophila,2512333,10.1002/cne.902900203,"There is a rich history of behavioral and physiological studies on the leg sensory systems of flies. Here we examine the anatomy of the sensory axons of two species of fly and demonstrate that the location of the axonal projections in the CNS can be correlated with the modality they encode. We studied receptors associated with proprioceptive, tactile, and multimodal hairs. Proprioceptive hairs occur in clusters, called hair plates, and are situated near joints. The neuron innervating each proprioceptive hair has a large axon and coarse arborization in the intermediate neuropil. Tactile receptors have smaller arbors, which are located in a ventral region of the thoracic neuromere. Finally, the multimodal hairs are each innervated by one tactile and four chemosensory neurons. The single tactile neuron has a central arbor that is indistinguishable from those of the tactile hairs; the four chemosensory neurons project to yet a third region of neuropil near the ventral surface of each neuromere. Thus there is a clear modality-specific segregation of axonal arbors in the CNS. This organization is identical in Phormia and Drosophila and thus apparently highly conserved within the Diptera. We presume that, as in other insect sensory systems, this anatomical specificity is linked to synaptic specificity.",1989,"R K Murphey, D Possidente, G Pollack, D J Merritt, R K Murphey, D Possidente, G Pollack, D J Merritt"

Identification of a fully-functional hobo transposable element and its use for germ-line transformation of Drosophila,2540958,,"The transposable element hobo can be mobilized to induce a variety of genetic abnormalities within the germ-line of Drosophila melanogaster. Strains containing hobos have 3.0 kb elements and numerous smaller derivatives of the element. By analogy with other transposable element systems, it is likely that only the 3.0 kb elements are capable of inducing hobo mobilization. Here, we report that a cloned 3.0 kb hobo, called HFL1, is able to mediate germ-line transformation and therefore is an autonomous (fully-functional) transposable element. Germ-line transformation was observed when HFL1 and a marked hobo element were co-injected into recipient embryos devoid of endogenous hobos. Integration did not occur in the absence of the 3.0 kb element. A single copy of the marked hobo transposon inserted at each site, and the target sites were widely distributed throughout the genome. Integration occurred at (or very near) the termini of hobo, without internal rearrangement of the hobo or marker gene sequences. The hobo transformation system will allow us to determine the structural and regulatory features of hobo responsible for its mobilization and will provide novel approaches for the molecular and genetic manipulation of the Drosophila genome.",1989,"R K Blackman, M M Koehler, R Grimaila, W M Gelbart, R K Blackman, M M Koehler, R Grimaila, W M Gelbart"

We have analyzed the conservation of the segmentation genes Krüppel (Kr) and even-skipped (eve) in parallel with sal coding sequences in several Drosophila species that are evolutionarily separated by up to 60 million years. To our surprise, sal sequences appear to be conserved in the Sophophora subgenus of the Drosophila genus but not in the Drosophila subgenus. On the other hand, the segmentation and other homeotic genes are conserved in the Drosophila subgroup as well. Our data suggest that sal encodes an accessory function that evolved relatively late during Drosophila speciation rather than playing a fundamental evolutionary role similar to that of other homeotic genes.",1989,"D Reuter, R Schuh, H Jäckle, D Reuter, R Schuh, H Jäckle"

Molecular and genetic organization of the suppressor of sable and minute (1) 1B region in Drosophila melanogaster,2503417,,"Recessive mutations at the suppressor of sable [su(s)] locus in Drosophila melanogaster result in suppression of second site mutations caused by insertions of the mobile element 412. In order to determine whether su(s) mutations might have other phenotypes, a saturation mapping of the su(s) region was carried out. The screen yielded 76 mutations that comprise ten genetic complementation groups ordered distal to proximal as follows: l(1)1Bh, l(1)1Bi, M(1)1B, su(s), l(1)1Bk, l(1)1Ca, mul, tw, l(1)lDa and brc. Twenty-three of the mutations are su(s) alleles, and all are suppressors of the 412-insertion-caused v1 allele. Although the screen could have detected su(s) mutations causing sex-specific dominant lethality or sterility as well as all types of recessive lethality or sterility, the only other phenotype observed was male sterility that is enhanced by cold temperature. This type of sterility is exhibited only by alleles induced by base-substitution-causing mutagens. Genetic functions of the poly(A+) messages transcribed from the su(s) microregion were identified by the reintroduction of cloned sequences into embryos by P element transformation. su(s) function has been attributed to a 5-kb message. The segment of DNA encoding only this 5-kb message rescues both the suppression and cold-sensitive male sterility phenotypes of su(s). Minute (1) 1B has been provisionally identified as encoding a 3.5-kb message; lethal (1)1Bi encodes a 1-kb message; and lethal (1)1Bk encodes a 4-kb message.

Alcohol dehydrogenase and ethanol tolerance at the cellular level in Drosophila melanogaster,2498460,10.1002/jez.1402500105,"Exposure of early third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster to a nonlethal dose of ethanol was detrimental to larvae lacking alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) but beneficial to wild-type larvae in terms of surviving a later ethanol tolerance test, indicating that one of the important functions of the ADH system is to supply derivatives of ethanol to larvae that in turn promote ethanol tolerance. High intracellular concentrations of ethanol in ADH-deficient (Adhn2) larvae fed ethanol were accompanied by a decrease in the cell membrane infoldings of fat body cells, suggesting that the capacities to absorb and release molecules were reduced. Marked effects of ethanol on the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of ADH-deficient larvae were also evident. The absence of similar changes in wild-type larvae that were fed moderate levels of ethanol showed that the ADH system kept the intracellular level of ethanol at a concentration low enough to avoid cell damage. A cytometric analysis of electron micrographs showed that there were ethanol-induced reductions in glycogen, lipid, and protein stores in the fat body cells of ADH-deficient larvae fed 1.25% ethanol (v/v) compared with null larvae fed an ethanol-free diet. This finding implied that the capacities to synthesize or store these compounds may be limited by high intracellular concentrations of ethanol. The cytometric analysis also revealed that the consumption of diets containing 2.5% and 4.5% ethanol by Canton-S wild-type larvae for 3 days after 4 days of feeding on an ethanol-free diet resulted in decreases in glycogen and protein deposits in fat body cells, but increased the amount of lipid deposits compared to larvae fed an ethanol-free diet. This observation, coupled with the greater weight of wild-type adults that were fed a growth-limiting concentration of ethanol compared with control adults, suggested that a metabolic defense mechanism in larvae is to convert toxic ethanol to nontoxic storage products. Dietary ethanol alone and in combination with isopropanol stimulated an increase in the size of the NAD-pool in larvae, a condition that may favor the activity of ADH.

A moveable 5' splice site in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes of Drosophila species,2501662,10.1128/mcb.9.5.2220,"In two distantly related Drosophila species, the use of alternate 5' splice sites to process an intron in pre-mRNA from homologous adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT)-encoding genes led to RNAs encoding nonfunctional peptides in addition to APRT.

"Tnt1, a mobile retroviral-like transposable element of tobacco isolated by plant cell genetics",2536143,10.1038/337376a0,"Transposable elements can be identified by their ability to induce mutant alleles at new loci. The retrotransposon family is thought to transpose through an RNA intermediate and has many similarities to vertebrate proretroviruses. In plants, retrotransposons have been described in maize, Arabidopsis and wheat, and non-viral retroposons in maize. Most of these elements, however, have been found as non-mobile integrated units. Here, we report the isolation of the first tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transposable element, Tnt1, which seems to be the most complete mobile retrotransposon characterized in higher plants. Tnt1 has been isolated after its transposition into the nitrate reductase (NR) structural gene of tobacco, and transposition events have been detected through in vitro selection of spontaneous NR-deficient (NR-) mutant lines in cell cultures derived from tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. Tnt1 is 5,334 nucleotides long, contains two 610-base-pair-long terminal repeats and a single open reading frame of 3,984 nucleotides. Comparison of the Tnt1 open reading frame coding potential with those of the Drosophila melanogaster copia retrotransposon, yeast Ty retrotransposon, and vertebrate proretroviruses revealed that Tnt1 is closely related to copia and carries all the functions known to be required for autonomous transposition by reverse transcription.",1989,"M A Grandbastien, A Spielmann, M Caboche, M A Grandbastien, A Spielmann, M Caboche"
l(1)pole hole is required maternally for pattern formation in the terminal regions of the embryo,2516795,,"Maternal expression of the l(1)pole hole (l(1)ph) gene product is required for the development of the Drosophila embryo. When maternal l(1)ph+ activity is absent, alterations in the embryonic fate map occur as visualized by the expression of segmentation genes fushitarazu and engrailed. If both maternal and zygotic activity is absent, embryos degenerate around 7 h of development. If only maternal activity is missing, embryos complete embryogenesis and show deletions of both anterior and posterior structures. Anteriorly, structures originating from labral and acron head regions are missing. Posteriorly, abdominal segments A8, 9 and 10, the telson and the proctodeum are missing. Similar pattern deletions are observed in embryos derived from the terminal class of female sterile mutations. Thus, the maternal l(1)ph+ gene product is required for the establishment of cell identities at the anterior and posterior poles of the Drosophila embryo.",1989,"L Ambrosio, A P Mahowald, N Perrimon, L Ambrosio, A P Mahowald, N Perrimon"
Patterns of amino acid incorporation in long-lived genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster,2495976,10.1016/0531-5565(89)90036-3,"This study examined the age-dependent alterations in the in vivo incorporation of labeled amino acids into protein during the adult life spans of males and females obtained from genetically based long-lived and control strains of Drosophila melanogaster. All four groups tested showed significant decreases (ca. 50%) in the uptake of labeled amino acids as a function of age. Each of the four groups had their own characteristic temporal pattern of functional decrement. Both the long-lived and the control females have similar patterns of amino acid incorporation, but the onset of these changes is delayed by 10 to 20 days in long-lived animals. These alterations in protein synthesis appear to be related to corresponding changes in the female fecundity patterns of each strain. The male patterns differ from one another and from the female patterns, but they both show periods of high fluctuation early in life followed by a terminal period of relatively low and constant synthesis. These data are consistent with the view that the overall alterations in the longevity of these two strains are likely due to changes in the timing of particular events in the adult life cycle.",1989,"R Pretzlaff, R Arking, R Pretzlaff, R Arking"
Engrailed gene expression in the abdominal segment of Oncopeltus: gradients and cell states in the insect segment,2577728,,"A monoclonal antibody that recognizes the product of the segmental gene, engrailed (en), of Drosophila has been used to analyse expression of the homologous gene of Oncopeltus. engrailed expression in the abdominal segment of larval Oncopeltus is confined to a narrow band of epidermal cells localized immediately anterior to the segment border. Expression varies in intensity during postembryonic development: no gene product is detectable in newly moulted larvae, but reappears soon after initiation of intermoult activities. One possible function of en in this system is revealed by a series of operations confronting cells from different anteroposterior levels in the segment. New segment borders are generated only when en-expressing cells confront cells from the anteriormost region of the segment. All other combinations result in intercalation of intermediate intrasegmental levels. It is therefore suggested that the most important function of en is the establishment of new, and presumably the maintenance of existing, segment borders.",1989,"G L Campbell, S Caveney, G L Campbell, S Caveney"

Diacylglycerol kinase defect in a Drosophila retinal degeneration mutant rdgA,2538432,,"The Drosophila visual mutant rdgA is known to show age-dependent retinal degeneration with defective diacylglycerol (DG) kinase activity. In this study we examined DG kinase activity of several visual mutants and found that only rdgA mutant eyes showed the lack of DG kinase activity in a gene dosage-dependent manner. The enzyme activity is already absent at the time of eclosion from pupal case when the degeneration is not yet apparent. To examine whether rdgA gene dosage effect holds for other enzymes related to the phosphatidylinositol turnover, phospholipase C was analyzed which did not show any gene dosage effect. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that rdgA gene correlates closely with DG kinase activity, and the defect of DG kinase activity is a primary cause of retinal degeneration in rdgA mutant.",1989,"H Inoue, T Yoshioka, Y Hotta, H Inoue, T Yoshioka, Y Hotta"

Heterosis in crosses between lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected for adaptation to different environments,24232537,10.1007/BF00266195,"Experiments were designed to examine whether heterosis would occur in crosses of Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted to 18 °C or 28 °C environments. Crosses were examined in parental environments, an intermediate environment (23 °C) and a mixed environment (alternating 18°/28°C). Parental populations did not show divergence for larval viability, cold shock or high temperature mortalities when tested in a common environment. However, the 28 °C population was less fecund than the 18 °C population, but had higher larval competitive ability and higher adult longevity. Heterosis for viability, cold shock mortality and high temperature mortality occurred in crosses between a population adapted to 18 °C and another adapted to 28 °C, but not in crosses between two populations adapted to the same temperature. The results suggest that, in the absence of drift, heterosis is expected in crosses between lines or populations with different histories of selection but not between lines with the same selection histories.",1989,"N G Ehiobu, M E Goddard, N G Ehiobu, M E Goddard"
ADH activity and ethanol tolerance in third chromosome substitution lines in Drosophila melanogaster,2499561,10.1038/hdy.1989.5,"In vitro ADH activity and ethanol tolerance were studied in males of a series of third chromosome substitution lines in Drosophila melanogaster. The lines were divided into those with a random third chromosome from a vineyard population (VO lines) and those with a selected third chromosome from males obtained after an egg-to-adult ethanol survival test on the F4 of the previous population (VE lines). Both ADH activity and ethanol tolerance varied significantly among the lines, but the characters showed no significant correlation. Ethanol tolerance (at the higher ethanol concentrations) was higher in the selected lines (VE lines) but ADH activity was not. In our lines, the in vitro ADH activity variability, linked to the regulatory genes (located on the third chromosome) and unrelated to the polymorphism of the Adh locus (located on the second chromosome), is not involved in the ethanol tolerance variability. The data suggest that in this population ethanol tolerance was acquired in nature, at least partially, by means other than increasing ADH activity.",1989,"H Merçot, L Massaad, H Merçot, L Massaad"
Expression of microinjected hsp 70/CAT and hsp 30/CAT chimeric genes in developing Xenopus laevis embryos,2591315,,"The expression of microinjected chimeric genes containing Drosophila hsp 70 and Xenopus hsp 70 and hsp 30 promoters linked to the reporter gene coding for bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) was examined during early development of Xenopus laevis. Heat-inducible expression of fusion genes containing either the Drosophila hsp 70 promoter (1100 bp) or the Xenopus hsp 70 promoter (750 bp) was first detectable after the midblastula stage of development. This coincides with the embryonic stage at which the endogenous hsp 70 gene is first heat-inducible. A Xenopus hsp 30/CAT fusion gene containing 350 bp of promoter sequences was also heat-inducible after the midblastula stage unlike the endogenous hsp 30 genes which were not heat-inducible until the early tailbud stage (stage 23-24). Sequences that are present within either the coding or 3' region of the hsp 30 clone do not cause the microinjected hsp 30 gene to be developmentally regulated in a normal manner. Additionally, microinjected hsp 30 gene sequences have no effect on the developmental regulation of endogenous hsp 30 genes which continue to be activated at the tailbud stage of development. Our data suggest, that an inhibitory system, which may control the expression of the endogenous hsp 30 gene during development, does not regulate the expression of the injected hsp 30 gene.",1989,"P H Krone, J J Heikkila, P H Krone, J J Heikkila"
Morphometric analysis of thoracic muscles in wildtype and in bithorax Drosophila,2109553,10.1002/ar.1092260315,"The tergotrochanteral (TTM) ""jump"" muscles in the second (T2) and third (T3) thoracic segments of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, were analyzed morphologically and morphometrically in wildtype (Canton-S) and bithorax mutants (abx bx3 pbx/Df(3R)P2). In the transformed T3 segments of mutant flies, the TTMs were greatly increased in fiber number (330% of wildtype), length (141%), and volume (460%), thus manifesting both hyperplasia and hypertrophy. In contrast, TTMs in the ""untransformed"" T2 segments of mutant flies were both hypoplastic and hypotrophic, in that significant decreases in fiber number (93% of wildtype), length (90%), and volume (80%) were observed. Two relationships emerged from analysis of the morphometric data: 1) Although the fiber numbers and volumes of the transformed T3 TTMs in bithorax flies were greatly increased, the total combined volumes of the TTMs in T2 + T3 remained approximately the same in bithorax compared to wildtype flies. 2) The changes in TTM volumes in bithorax flies compared to those in wildtype were proportional to the relative changes in fiber numbers times the relative changes in muscle lengths. These observations suggest that the genes of the bithorax complex influence the number and the length of tubular muscles fibers of the TTMs, but do not significantly affect the mean cross-sectional areas of these fibers. Fibrillar muscle fibers, which are not found at all in T3 segments in wildtype flies, were observed in the transformed T3 segments of bithorax mutants in 11 of 18 cases (61%), but typically as wisps, not in complete muscles. We suggest that, in the T3 segment of the bithorax flies, the relative differences between the massive transformation of tubular TTMs vs. the minimal appearance of fibrillar muscles may be related, in part, to the relative availability of muscle precursors.",1990,"M D Egger, S Harris, B Peng, A M Schneiderman, R J Wyman, M D Egger, S Harris, B Peng, A M Schneiderman, R J Wyman"
Zygotic activity of the nullo locus is required to stabilize the actin-myosin network during cellularization in Drosophila,2088725,,"Cellularization of the Drosophila embryo requires the establishment of a hexagonal network of actin and myosin filaments that are interconnected around the nuclei in the cortex of the syncytial blastoderm. This cytoskeletal network provides the framework and possibly the contractile force for the membrane invaginations that synchronously subdivide the syncytial embryo into individual cells. Zygotic expression of the nullo locus is essential for the preservation of an intact actin-myosin network. Embryos deleted for the nullo locus have a disrupted network, resulting in the formation of many multinucleate cells. We show that nullo is not required for the initial formation of the actin-myosin network, but is necessary for the maintenance of its hexagonal shape during cellularization. The phenotype of embryonic mosaics is nonautonomous, indicating that nullo does not have to be expressed in every nucleus for proper cellularization. Examination of nullo mutant clones in adults reveals that nullo activity is not required for cell division in imaginal discs. Furthermore, germline clone experiments suggest that maternal expression of the nullo locus is not essential for either germline proliferation or the cellularization of progeny. We propose a model in which nullo functions specifically at cellularization to stabilize the actin-myosin network during contraction.",1990,"L Simpson, E Wieschaus, L Simpson, E Wieschaus"

Molecular genetics of Drosophila alpha-actinin: mutant alleles disrupt Z disc integrity and muscle insertions,2112549,10.1083/jcb.110.6.1999,"We have isolated a Drosophila melanogaster alpha-actinin gene and partially characterized several mutant alleles. The Drosophila protein sequence is very similar (68% identity) to those of chicken alpha-actinin isoforms, but less closely related (30% identity) to Dictyostelium alpha-actinin. The gene is within subdivision 2C of the X chromosome, coincident with 15 lethal (1)2Cb mutations. At least four alleles, l(1)2Cb1, l(1)2Cb2, l(1)2Cb4, and l(1)2Cb5 are interrupted by rearrangement breakpoints and must be null. In all four cases, hemizygous mutants complete embryogenesis and do not die until the second day of larval growth, signifying that either the role of alpha-actinin in nonmuscle cells is redundant or that a distinct and only distantly related gene encodes the non-muscle isoform. Allelic but less severely affected fliA mutants are apparently due to point mutations, and develop into adults having thoracic muscle abnormalities. EM of mutant muscles reveals that Z discs and myofibrillar attachments are disrupted, whereas epithelial ""tendon"" cells are less affected.

Complementation of fission yeast cdc2ts and cdc25ts mutants identifies two cell cycle genes from Drosophila: a cdc2 homologue and string,2120044,,"We have exploited the universality of the molecular mechanisms that control entry into mitosis to clone the Drosophila melanogaster homologues of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell division control (cdc) genes by the complementation of temperature sensitive mutations. The Drosophila genes were expressed in S.pombe as cDNAs from the SP6 promoter. Successful recovery of complementing plasmids required that we first 'adapt' pooled plasmids from a Drosophila embryonic cDNA library for propagation in fission yeast by introducing an ars1-LEU2 DNA fragment into the vector. This library was introduced into S.pombe cdc2 and cdc25 mutants, and plasmids isolated carrying cDNAs that complement these mutations. The gene that encodes the Drosophila cdc2 homologue maps to a single locus in the Drosophila genome at 31E on chromosome 2. It is expressed maternally to provide mRNA in syncytial embryos, and appears to be zygotically expressed in mitotically active regions of the cellularized embryo. We have isolated two different cDNAs that complement cdc25-22. One corresponds to a transcript of string, previously described as the Drosophila homologue of cdc25, and the other to a gene that has not been previously characterized.",1990,"J Jimenez, L Alphey, P Nurse, D M Glover, J Jimenez, L Alphey, P Nurse, D M Glover"
Molecular basis of altered excitability in Shaker mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,1702382,,"Mutations in the Shaker (Sh) locus of Drosophila melanogaster have differing effects on action potential duration and repolarization in neurons as well as on A-type K+ channels (IA) in muscle. The molecular basis of three exemplary Sh alleles (ShKS133, ShE62 and Sh5) has been identified. They are point mutations in the Sh transcription unit expressing aberrant voltage-gated A-type K+ channels. Replicas of each mutation have been introduced by in vitro mutagenesis into Sh cDNA. The expression of in vitro transcribed mutant Sh cRNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes reproduced the specific phenotypic traits of each Sh allele. The lack of IA in ShKS133 is due to a missense mutation within a sequence motif occurring in all hitherto characterized voltage-gated K+ channel forming proteins. The reduction of IA in ShE62 is due to a mutation in an AG acceptor site. The intervening sequence between exons 19 and 20 is not spliced in ShE62 RNA. As a consequence, ShE62 flies do not contain the full complement of Sh K+ forming proteins. Finally, the Sh5 mutation leads to an altered voltage dependence of K+ channel activation and inactivation as well as to an accelerated rate of recovery from inactivation. This is due to a missense mutation altering the amino acid sequence of the proposed transmembrane segment S5 of the Sh K+ channels. Segment S5 is located adjacently to the presumed voltage sensor of voltage-gated ion channels. The results explain the altered properties of excitable cells in Sh mutants and provide a general model for the possible role of A-type K+ channels in modulating action potential profiles.",1990,"R Lichtinghagen, M Stocker, R Wittka, G Boheim, W Stühmer, A Ferrus, O Pongs, R Lichtinghagen, M Stocker, R Wittka, G Boheim, W Stühmer, A Ferrus, O Pongs"
Restoration of inactivation in mutants of Shaker potassium channels by a peptide derived from ShB,2122520,10.1126/science.2122520,"Site-directed mutagenesis experiments have suggested a model for the inactivation mechanism of Shaker potassium channels from Drosophila melanogaster. In this model, the first 20 amino acids form a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the open channel to cause inactivation. The model was tested by the internal application of a synthetic peptide, with the sequence of the first 20 residues of the ShB alternatively spliced variant, to noninactivating mutant channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The peptide restored inactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Like normal inactivation, peptide-induced inactivation was not noticeably voltage-dependent. Trypsin-treated peptide and peptides with sequences derived from the first 20 residues of noninactivating mutants did not restore inactivation. These results support the proposal that inactivation occurs by a cytoplasmic domain that occludes the ion-conducting pore of the channel.",1990,"W N Zagotta, T Hoshi, R W Aldrich, W N Zagotta, T Hoshi, R W Aldrich"
Role of receptor tyrosine kinases during Drosophila development,2164907,10.1002/9780470513927.ch12,"In vertebrates, a tyrosine kinase activity has been identified as an integral component of growth factor receptors and the products of proto-oncogenes. Many of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) appear to play a key role in the regulation of cell growth. Recent analyses of several Drosophila genes encoding putative RTKs indicate that this class of proteins also plays an important role in decisions about cell fate that depend on cellular interactions during development. The sevenless RTK mediates the position-dependent specification of a particular photoreceptor cell type (R7) in the eye. The local specification of R7 cells requires a functional tyrosine kinase domain of the sevenless protein but does not depend on the spatially restricted expression of the sevenless gene. The Drosophila EGF receptor homologue serves multiple functions during development, some of which are clearly unrelated to regulation of cell growth. Finally, the torso gene encodes an RTK required for the specification of the terminal regions of the Drosophila larva. A number of other genes have been genetically identified that appear to function in the same developmental processes upstream or downstream of these three RTKs. These loci are excellent candidates for genes encoding other components of the signalling pathways, such as ligands or substrates of the RTKs.",1990,"E Hafen, K Basler, E Hafen, K Basler"
Sequence analysis suggests that tetra-nucleotides signal the termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes,2123028,10.1093/nar/18.21.6339,"An increasing number of cases where tri-nucleotide stop codons do not signal the termination of protein synthesis are being reported. In order to identify what constitutes an efficient stop signal, we analysed the region around natural stop codons in genes from a wide variety of eukaryotic species and gene families. Certain stop codons and nucleotides following stop codons are over-represented, and this pattern is accentuated in highly expressed genes. For example, the preferred signal for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster highly expressed genes is UAAG, and generally the signals UAA(A/G) and UGA(A/G) are preferred in eukaryotes. The GC% of the organism or DNA region can affect whether there is A or G in the second or fourth positions. We suggest therefore, that the stop codon and the nucleotide following it comprise a tetra-nucleotide stop signal. A model is proposed in which the polypeptide chain release factor, a protein, recognises this sequence, but will tolerate some substitution, particularly A to G in the second or third positions.",1990,"C M Brown, P A Stockwell, C N Trotman, W P Tate, C M Brown, P A Stockwell, C N Trotman, W P Tate"

Since clusters of homeodomain binding sites can also be found in the promoters of other silk protein genes, the fibroin gene and the sericin-1 gene, these observations suggest a possible involvement of some homeobox genes in the regulation of a group of silk protein genes.",1990,"C C Hui, Y Suzuki, Y Kikuchi, S Mizuno, C C Hui, Y Suzuki, Y Kikuchi, S Mizuno"
A novel transvection phenomenon affecting the white gene of Drosophila melanogaster,2121594,,"The zeste mutation of Drosophila melanogaster suppresses the expression of white genes in the eye. This suppression is normally dependent on there being two copies of w+ located close to each other in the genome--they may either be in cis (as in a tandem duplication of w+) or in trans, i.e. on homologous chromosomes. Duplicated w+ genes carried by a giant transposing element, TE146(Z), are suppressed by z whether they are in direct (tandem) or inverted order. The tandem form of the TE is very sensitive to a rearrangement on the homologous chromosome--many rearrangements with breakpoints ""opposite"" the TE's insertion site prevent the interaction between the white genes on a z background. These aberrations act as dominant suppressors of zeste that are specific to the tandemly duplicated form of TE146(Z). The inverted form of the TE146(Z) presumably pairs as a hairpin loop; this is more stable than the tandem form by the criterion that its zeste phenotype is unaffected by any of the aberrations. This effect of rearrangements has been used as the basis for a screen, gamma-ray induced aberrations with at least one breakpoint opposite the TE site were recovered by their suppression of the zeste phenotype.",1990,"D Gubb, M Ashburner, J Roote, T Davis, D Gubb, M Ashburner, J Roote, T Davis"

In addition, quantitative methods have been employed to calculate the relative evolutionary distances between pairs of the decarboxylases comprising this family. The multiple sequence analysis together with the quantitative results strongly suggest an ancient and common origin for all PLP-dependent decarboxylases. This analysis also indicates that prokaryotic and eukaryotic HDC activities evolved independently.

Purification and characterization of DNA ligase II from Drosophila melanogaster,2120058,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19284.x,"Drosophila melanogaster contains DNA ligases I and II. The activity of DNA ligase I is especially high during early embryonic periods, but decreases rapidly afterwards. Although the activity of DNA ligase II is low, it persists throughout all developmental stages. The specific activity of DNA ligase II is high in embryos, but the total activity per body mass was highest in pupae. To characterize the properties of DNA ligase II further and to clarify its differences from DNA ligase I, DNA ligase II was prepared from pupae of D. melanogaster. The enzyme was purified about 3200-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40-70% saturation), phosphocellulose (P11) and Ultrogel column chromatography. Some of the properties have been reported previously. The isoelectric point of DNA ligase II was 6.4 while those of DNA ligase I were 4.9 and 5.8. The optimum pH of DNA ligase II was 7.8-8.1 but 8.0-8.5 for DNA ligase I. The molecular masses of DNA ligase II adducts with AMP were determined as 90 and 70 kDa. These adducts were degraded to 42 and 14.4 kDa by trypsin digestion. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, a mouse was immunized with the purified enzyme. Two clones, 10-6 and 3-3 IgM, were obtained and purified from mouse ascites. These antibodies showed both binding and neutralizing activities toward DNA ligase II from D. melanogaster, but did not react with DNA ligase I from the same origin.

Requirements for integrins during Drosophila development,2340808,,"The common beta subunit of the PS antigens of Drosophila is homologous with vertebrate integrins and is encoded by the lethal(1)myospheroid gene. We have generated flies mosaic for wild-type and mutant alleles of lethal(1)myospheroid using adult gynandromorphs and radiation-induced somatic crossing over. The defects observed in the gynandromorphs demonstrate widespread requirements for PS integrins during development especially in ventrally derived structures, which also show strong expression of PS beta integrin. Smaller lethal(1)myospheroid clones induced during larval development result in blister and vein defects in the wings and aberrant development of photoreceptor cells, demonstrating roles for PS integrins during development of both wings and eyes. PS integrins are required for the close apposition of the dorsal and ventral wing epithelia and for the proper arrangement of photoreceptor cells. However, many other adhesive and morphogenetic processes proceed normally in the absence of integrins containing the beta subunit encoded by lethal(1)myospheroid.",1990,"S Zusman, R S Patel-King, C Ffrench-Constant, R O Hynes, S Zusman, R S Patel-King, C Ffrench-Constant, R O Hynes"
Interstrand duplexes in hnRNA: the occurrence of retrotransposon antisense sequences,1963576,,We have previously identified a class of non-polyadenylated hnRNA molecules (CLASS IA-) which hydrogen bond to polyadenylated hnRNA molecules. Characterization of clones from a Drosophila Class IA- cDNA library reveals that 18S rRNA and transcripts derived from intermediate repeat DNA constitute the bulk of such molecules. The most abundant non-ribosomal clone in the library derives from the antisense strand of the Copia retrotransposon and occurs in Drosophila Kc cell Class IA- hnRNA as non-polyadenylated transcripts of 10 and 15 kb.,1990,"K Miller, J Rosenbaum, V Zbrzezna, A Pogo, K Miller, J Rosenbaum, V Zbrzezna, A Pogo"
No character displacement for reproductive isolation between Drosophila bipectinata and Drosophila malerkotliana,1778468,10.1139/g91-131,"To test whether character displacement for reproductive isolation between Drosophila bipectinata and Drosophila malerkotliana exists, the degree of sexual isolation was measured between their sympatric and allopatric populations. Although the isolation indices vary in different crosses, the average isolation index for sympatric populations is very close to that for allopatric populations. This shows no difference in the degree of sexual isolation between sympatric and allopatric populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana. Thus there is no evidence for the existence of character displacement for sexual isolation between these two closely related sympatric species.",1991,"B N Singh, S Chatterjee, B N Singh, S Chatterjee"
The maternal gene nanos has a central role in posterior pattern formation of the Drosophila embryo,1935684,,"A group of maternal genes, the posterior group, is required for the development of the abdominal region in the Drosophila embryo. We have used genetic as well as cytoplasmic transfer experiments to order seven of the posterior group genes (nanos, pumilio, oskar, valois, vasa, staufen and tudor) into a functional pathway. An activity present in the posterior pole plasm of wild-type embryos can restore normal abdominal development in posterior group mutants. This activity is synthesized during oogenesis and the gene nanos most likely encodes this activity. The other posterior group genes have distinct accessory functions: pumilio acts downstream of nanos and is required for the distribution or stability of the nanos-dependent activity in the embryo. Staufen, oskar, vasa, valois and tudor act upstream of nanos. Embryos from females mutant for these genes lack the specialized posterior pole plasm and consequently fail to form germ-cell precursors. We suggest that the products of these genes provide the physical structure necessary for the localization of nanos-dependent activity and of germ line determinants.",1991,"R Lehmann, C Nüsslein-Volhard, R Lehmann, C Nüsslein-Volhard"
Dosage compensation of the Drosophila pseudoobscura Hsp82 gene and the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene at ectopic sites in D. melanogaster,1907376,10.1073/pnas.88.15.6795,"Measurements were made of the amounts of larval RNA transcribed from the autosomal Adh gene of Drosophila melanogaster and the X chromosomal Hsp82 gene of Drosophila pseudoobscura carried on the same P-element transposon inserted at various sites in the D. melanogaster genome. Both genes were fully compensated at sites in euchromatic regions of the X chromosome but neither was compensated at a site in the centric beta-heterochromatin of the X chromosome. No compensation of the D. pseudoobscura Hsp82 gene was found at any of 10 autosomal insertion sites tested. The compensation behavior of the transposed genes was, therefore, not determined by closely linked sequences but instead was determined in each case by their new chromosomal environment.",1991,"H Sass, M Meselson, H Sass, M Meselson"
Rescue from the abnormal oocyte maternal-effect lethality by ABO heterochromatin in Drosophila melanogaster,1908398,,"The euchromatic maternal-effect mutation abnormal oocyte (abo), of Drosophila melanogaster interacts with regions of heterochromatin known as ABO, which reside on the X, Y and second chromosomes. Here, we show that survival of progeny from abo females depends in part upon the maternal dosage of ABO heterochromatin. A comparison was made of the recovery of genotypically identical progeny from abo mothers bearing sex chromosomes of various ABO contents. The results show that the recovery of daughters was decreased if mothers were ABO-/ABO-. However, no decrease was observed if mothers were ABO+/ABO-. In addition, the survival of daughters was greater when they received an ABO-X chromosome from an ABO-/ABO+ mother rather than the father. We suggest that these results reflect a complementation or interaction between the ABO-deficient X and the ABO heterochromatin in the maternal genome. This proposed interaction could occur early in oogenesis in the mother or prior to completion of meiosis I in the fertilized egg. To determine if zygotic dosage of ABO heterochromatin might also be important at very early stages of embryogenesis, we examined the timing of zygotic rescue by paternally donated ABO heterochromatin using a second mutation, paternal loss (pal). Homozygous pal males produce progeny which lose paternally derived chromosomes during the early zygotic divisions. Zygotes that have lost a paternal sex chromosome in a fraction of their nuclei will be mosaic for the amount of ABO heterochromatin. By monitoring the recovery of pal-induced mosaics from abo and abo+ females, we could determine the temporal and spatial requirements for ABO function. Results show that the survival of progeny from the abo maternal-effect lethality was increased if ABO heterochromatin was present prior to the pal-induced loss event. Analysis of mosaic patterns did not reveal a specific lethal focus. We conclude from these results that ABO heterochromatin serves its vital function prior to completion of the early cleavage divisions in progeny of abo mothers.",1991,"J Tomkiel, S Pimpinelli, L Sandler, J Tomkiel, S Pimpinelli, L Sandler"
Chromosome rearrangement by ectopic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster: genome structure and evolution,1783293,,Ectopic recombination between interspersed repeat sequences generates chromosomal rearrangements that have a major impact on genome structure. A survey of ectopic recombination in the region flanking the white locus of Drosophila melanogaster identified 25 transposon-mediated rearrangements from four parallel experiments. Eighteen of the 25 were generated from females carrying X chromosomes heterozygous for interspersed repeat sequences. The cytogenetic and molecular analyses of the rearrangements and the parental chromosomes show: (1) interchromosomal and intrachromosomal recombinants are generated in about equal numbers; (2) ectopic recombination appears to be a meiotic process that is stimulated by the interchromosomal effect to about the same degree as regular crossing over; (3) copies of the retrotransposon roo were involved in all of the interchromosomal exchanges; some copies were involved much more frequently than others in the target region; (4) homozygosis for interspersed repeat sequences and other sequence variations significantly reduced ectopic recombination.,1991,"E A Montgomery, S M Huang, C H Langley, B H Judd, E A Montgomery, S M Huang, C H Langley, B H Judd"

Organizer-specific homeobox genes in Xenopus laevis embryos,1677215,10.1126/science.1677215,The dorsal blastopore lip of the early Xenopus laevis gastrula can organize a complete secondary body axis when transplanted to another embryo. A search for potential gene regulatory components specifically expressed in the organizer was undertaken that resulted in the identification of four types of complementary DNAs from homeobox-containing genes that fulfill this criterion. The most abundant of these encodes a DNA-binding specificity similar to that of the Drosophila melanogaster anterior morphogen bicoid. The other three are also homologous to developmentally significant Drosophila genes.

Drosophila snRNP associated protein P11 which specifically binds to heat shock puff 93D reveals strong homology with hnRNP core protein A1,1717937,10.1093/nar/19.18.4909,We have isolated cDNAs coding for a ribonucleoprotein of Drosophila melanogaster that is distinguished by its nearly exclusive presence at only one of the several heat shock puffs in polytene chromosomes of third instar larvae. We determined the nucleotide sequence and deduced the corresponding amino acid sequence. Its coding capacity for a 39 kDa protein is consistent with the size of the protein detected by the monoclonal antibody P11 used for expression cloning. Our results show that the P11 protein belongs to the category of hnRNP proteins of bipartite structure: the amino-terminal half contains two RNA binding domains and the carboxyterminal half is rich in glycine residues. Analysis of the genomic structure revealed two introns located within the coding portion of the gene and a third one in the 3'untranslated region. We detect two different polyadenylation sites as a result of alternative termination-polyadenylation. Its strong sequence homology with hnRNP A1 protein and its previously shown association with snRNP particles indicates that a typical hnRNP protein may also exist in a complex with snRNP particles. The P11 sequence corresponds to the Hrb87F sequence that was recently described by Haynes et al. (1) as hnRNP A related gene.,1991,"B T Hovemann, E Dessen, H Mechler, E Mack, B T Hovemann, E Dessen, H Mechler, E Mack"
Soft selection and quantitative genetic variation: a laboratory experiment,1908838,10.1038/hdy.1991.40,"The effect of environmental heterogeneity on the genetic variation of different quantitative characters was studied in two laboratory and two recently captured populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Two different culture media (habitats R and G) were used. Coarse-grained heterogeneity with independent density control in each habitat (R + G), and fine-grained (R/G) heterogeneity were simulated in population cages. Control populations in both R and G habitats were also maintained. Genetic differences for oviposition-site preference, larval preference and/or within-habitat viability were found between subpopulations sampled from different media. This happened in all four populations maintained on R + G, two populations maintained on R/G, and one control population. Thus, environmental heterogeneity seems to protect genetic variability responsible for between-habitat genetic differentiation, particularly when such heterogeneity corresponds to the 'soft selection' model (R + G). However, for the quasi-neutral trait sternopleural bristle number, no genetic between-habitat differentiation, nor increased heritability were observed in populations maintained under any kind of environmental heterogeneity. Hence, although soft selection seems to be a real force in determining adaptation to heterogeneous environments, the genetic variability maintained may be small in relation to the whole genome.",1991,"A García-Dorado, P Martin, N García, A García-Dorado, P Martin, N García"
The discs-large tumor suppressor gene of Drosophila encodes a guanylate kinase homolog localized at septate junctions,1651169,10.1016/0092-8674(81)90009-x,"Mutations of the lethal(1)discs large-1 (dlg) tumor suppressor gene of Drosophila cause neoplastic overgrowth of the imaginal discs. Sequencing of a near full-length cDNA predicts a protein containing a domain homologous to yeast guanylate kinase and a region homologous to SH3, a putative regulatory motif in nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases and other signal transduction proteins. Immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against fusion peptides shows that the dlg gene product is localized in an apical belt of the lateral cell membrane, at the position of the septate junction. The results suggest that a signal transduction process involving guanine nucleotides occurs at the septate junction and is necessary for cell proliferation control in Drosophila epithelia.",1991,"D F Woods, P J Bryant, D F Woods, P J Bryant"
The nucleotide sequence of a third cyclophilin-homologous gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae,1803821,10.1002/yea.320070909,"The nucleotide sequence of a 1558 bp DNA fragment from the right arm of chromosome III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains an open reading frame of 954 nucleotides with coding potential for a protein with high similarity to the ubiquitous cyclophilins which are both peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases and cyclosporin A-binding proteins. It should, therefore, represent the third gene (SCC3) of this kind from S. cerevisiae. SCC3 is present in a single copy in the genome of S. cerevisiae and results in a constitutively expressed 1.2 kb transcript during cell growth. Its putative protein product (Scc3) contains two hydrophobic cores, one at the amino terminal, 20 amino acids long, which could serve as a signal peptide, and the other one at the carboxyl end with a structure similar to a transmembrane helix. These findings suggest that Scc3 could be a secretory or, more likely, a transmembrane protein. The only cyclophilin with similar structure to that of Scc3 is ninaA from Drosophila melanogaster, a transmembrane protein which seems to be implicated in the correct folding and/or intercalation of rhodopsin in the endoplasmic reticulum of the fly photoreceptors (Stamnes, M.A. et al., Cell 65, 219-227, 1991). In addition, the amino and the carboxy regions of Scc3 and ninaA share a significant level of homology, which suggests that they have a similar function, albeit for different target proteins.",1991,"L Franco, A Jiménez, J Demolder, F Molemans, W Fiers, R Contreras, L Franco, A Jiménez, J Demolder, F Molemans, W Fiers, R Contreras"

Genetic control and expression of the major ejaculatory bulb protein (PEB-me) in Drosophila melanogaster,1772395,10.1007/BF00590103,"PEB-me is a predominant protein of mature Drosophila melanogaster ejaculatory bulbs. It is resolved into four or five closely spaced subfractions (apparent molecular weight 35-39 kD) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four electrophoretic variants of PEB-me differing in apparent molecular weight by 200-800 daltons were found. These appear to be controlled by four alleles of a gene (peb) located by recombination and deletion mapping to the 60F1-2 region of chromosome 2. A minor ejaculatory bulb protein of ca. 80 kD (hPEB) was found to be immunochemically related to PEB and possibly encoded by peb. PEB is not detected by immunoblotting techniques in virgin females, in male tissues other than the ejaculatory bulb, or during developmental stages preceding the formation of this organ. The results of transplantations of genital imaginal discs and of immature ejaculatory bulbs between two strains having different PEB alleles suggest that the ejaculatory bulb is the site of PEB synthesis. In flies mutant for tra, tra-2, dsx, or ix, tissue specificity of PEB localization is retained and the protein is found whenever the ejaculatory bulb is formed, regardless of the chromosomal sex of the fly. The protein is transferred into the female genital duct during mating, where it can be detected for up to 12 hr.

Light-induced suppression of endogenous circadian amplitude in humans,2002845,10.1038/350059a0,"Winfree reported 20 years ago the intriguing finding that a light stimulus of a critical strength applied at a critical circadian phase could essentially stop the circadian clock in Drosophila pseudo-obscura by resetting the circadian oscillator close to its singularity (a phaseless position at which the amplitude of circadian oscillation is zero). Since then, similar observations of attenuated circadian amplitude in response to critical stimuli have been limited to unicells, insects and plants. Our recent demonstration that the phase of the human circadian pacemaker could be inverted using an unconventional three-cycle stimulus led us to investigate whether critically timed exposure to a more moderate stimulus could drive that oscillator towards its singularity. Here we report that exposure of humans to fewer cycles of bright light, centred around the time at which the human circadian pacemaker is most sensitive to light-induced phase shifts, can markedly attenuate endogenous circadian amplitude. In some cases this results in an apparent loss of rhythmicity, as expected to occur in the region of singularity.",1991,"M E Jewett, R E Kronauer, C A Czeisler, M E Jewett, R E Kronauer, C A Czeisler"

"Genetic and cytogenetic analysis of the ""Th-Ps"" region of the Y chromosome of Drosophila hydei: evidence for dual functions of the lampbrush loop-forming fertility genes?",2062310,10.1007/BF00259683,"Two competing hypotheses have been proposed for the function of the Y chromosomal fertility factors in Drosophila, which form giant lampbrush loops during the primary spermatocyte stage. The first hypothesis suggests a conventional coding function, the second proposes an unconventional gene function mediated through protein binding by nascent transcripts. Therefore, we studied the genetics and cytogenetics of the two Y chromosomal fertility genes A and C of Drosophila hydei (which form the lampbrush loops threads and pseudonucleolus) in order to test the validity of these different hypotheses. Both lampbrush loops bind specific proteins, which are recognized by different antisera. Absence of either of the lampbrush loops does not interfere with the synthesis of the antigens but completely prevents the binding of the particular antigen to other lampbrush loops. Absence of the loops also does not interfere with the postmeiotic presence and localization of the particular antigen. Deletion (or inactivation) of either of the lampbrush loops threads or pseudonucleolus causes sterility of the male flies as do other male-sterile alleles of both fertility genes, which do not affect the morphology of the lampbrush loops. The phenotypic effects of these mutations on sperm morphogenesis are identical for all various male-sterile alleles of each of the fertility genes A and C, regardless of whether a particular allele leaves the loop intact, modifies that loop, or deletes (or inactivates) the loop completely. Finally, the isolation of fertile Y chromosomal mutations which modify the morphology of the lampbrush loops demonstrates that it is possible to uncouple loop morphology and genetic function. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the binding of proteins to a lampbrush loop has a substantial impact on spermiogenesis.",1991,"J H Hackstein, K H Glätzer, T J Hulsebos, J H Hackstein, K H Glätzer, T J Hulsebos"
The nature of X-ray-induced mutations after recovery in excision repair-deficient (mus-201) Drosophila females,1900568,10.1016/0027-5107(91)90040-u,"This paper describes the genetic analysis of X-ray-induced mutations at several visible loci (yellow, white, Notch, vermilion and forked) located on the X-chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster after recovery in excision repair-deficient condition (mus-201). A total of 118 mutations observed in 83636 F1 females were analyzed. The white mutations in particular have been investigated at the molecular level. The results show that: (1) the frequency of recovered whole-body mutations is similar or slightly lower in repair-deficient than in repair-proficient condition (respectively 1.5 x 10(-4)/locus/15 Gy and 2.3 x 10(-4)/locus/15 Gy); (2) the frequency of observed mosaic mutations is significantly higher in the repair-deficient condition than in the proficient condition (respectively 2.7 x 10(-4)/locus/15 Gy and 0.9 x 10(-4)/locus/15 Gy); (3) the analysis of F2 male lethal mutations and the cytological analysis of the recovered mutations in the excision repair-deficient condition indicate a decrease in mutations associated with gross chromosomal aberrations (including multilocus deletions); (4) at the molecular level, the spectrum of recovered intragenic mutations is similar after excision-deficient and -proficient repair. These results indicate that excision repair is involved in X-ray-induced DNA damage that is repaired efficiently in the normal repair condition, but bypassed in the excision repair-deficient condition, leading to mosaic mutations. In addition, lesions that apparently cannot be bypassed by DNA replication lead to a decrease in the fraction of mutations due to gross chromosomal aberrations among the whole-body mutations.",1991,"J C Eeken, C Vreeken, A W de Jong, A Pastink, J C Eeken, C Vreeken, A W de Jong, A Pastink"

To investigate the gene family encoding this motif in the human genome, a placental genomic library was screened at moderate stringency with a degenerate oligodeoxynucleotide probe designed to hybridize to the His/Cys (H/C) link region between adjoining zinc fingers. Over 200 phage clones were obtained and are being sorted into groups by partial sequencing, cross-hybridization with oligodeoxynucleotide probes, and PCR amplification. Further, the genomic clones were cross-hybridized with a set of 30 zinc finger-encoding cDNAs (Kox1-Kox30) isolated from a human T-cell cDNA library.

Observations on the polarity of mutant Drosophila follicles lacking the oocyte,28305830,10.1007/BF00592107,"Homozygous females of the mutantsegalitarian andBicaudal-D R26produce follicles in which the oocyte is replaced by an additional nurse cell. Normal morphological markers for polarity can be identified in mutant follicles but the normal spatial organization of these markers is disturbed. For example, nurse-cell nuclei of different ploidy classes are present but, contrary to wild-type follicles, the nuclei show no anteroposterior ploidy gradient. The two cells with four intercellular bridges, one of which should have developed into the oocyte rather than a nurse cell, are located at the posterior pole only in young follicles (up to about stage 5), whereas during later stages they are more often found at lateral or intermediate positions. This disturbed polarity correlates with a variable aberrant pattern of extracellular ionic currents. Moreover, in the mutant follicles patches of columnar follicular epithelium differentiate locally although this type of epithelium forms normally only around the oocyte. The follicle cells at both follicle poles possess anterior quality since they migrate from both poles towards the centre of the follicle, as do the border cells restricted to the anterior pole in wild-type follicles. Our analysis indicates that in the mutants the follicular polarity is normal at first but becomes disturbed during stages 5 to 6.

Copies of a Stellate gene variant are located in the X heterochromatin of Drosophila melanogaster and are probably expressed,1459425,,"Two variants of X chromosome Stellate genes responsible for crystal formation in XO male primary spermatocytes occupy different genome positions. The majority if not all of the 1250-bp Stellate genes are located at the 12E site where the Ste locus has been mapped and almost all of the 1150-bp Stellate repeats are concentrated in the distal X heterochromatin. Sequencing of Stellate genes derived from X heterochromatin reveals the preservation of their open reading frames and precise matching with some Stellate cDNAs reported earlier. At least some heterochromatic Stellate genes are suggested to be expressed and, therefore, involved in the interaction with the Y chromosome locus Su(Ste), as are the Stellate genes from 12E.",1992,"Y Y Shevelyov, Y Y Shevelyov"
Promoter-containing ribosomal DNA fragments function as X-Y meiotic pairing sites in D. melanogaster males,1304425,10.1002/dvg.1020130609,"The Drosophila melanogaster ribosomal DNA (rDNA) functions as an X-Y meiotic pairing site. Deletions encompassing the X chromosomal rDNA block (located in the heterochromatin) disrupt X-Y pairing and disjunction. Insertions of single, complete rRNA genes at ectopic locations on the heterochromatically deficient X partially restore X-Y pairing capacity. This study was undertaken to test fragments of an rDNA repeat for the ability to stimulate X-Y pairing and disjunction and to test for relationships between pairing capacity and two other phenotypes associated with rDNA insertions: transcription and the ability to organize a nucleolus. Insertions of three different fragments, all of which retained the rDNA promoter and upstream spacer sequences and which differed among each other in the length of downstream sequences, were obtained by P-element mediated transformation. One of the fragments is truncated only 140bp downstream from the promoter. Insertions of all three fragments proved capable of stimulating X-Y disjunction. Double insertions were substantially more effective than single insertions. RNA/PCR analysis was used to show that transcripts initiated at the inserted rDNA promoters are present in testis RNA from all insertions. Treatment with an antinucleolar antibody revealed that none of the insertions was associated with a mininucleolus. Thus promoter-containing rDNA fragments are autonomously capable of being transcribed and of functioning as X-Y pairing sites, but not of forming a mini-nucleolus.",1992,"C J Merrill, D Chakravarti, L Habera, S Das, L Eisenhour, B D McKee, C J Merrill, D Chakravarti, L Habera, S Das, L Eisenhour, B D McKee"

Soluble calcium binding proteins (SCBP) were isolated from homogenates of whole flies, from the thorax and from muscles of Drosophila melanogaster and Calliphora erythrocephala. 2. Crude preparations were obtained by extraction at low ionic strength, acid and heat treatment. The Drosophila protein was purified by gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange chromatography. In contrast to calmodulin the Drosophila SCBP did not bind to phenyl-Sepharose in a Ca(2+)-dependent way. 3. Both the Drosophila and the Calliphora protein revealed identical properties. 4. The apparent molecular mass of the SCBP is 24 kDa. Separation in urea-PAGE demonstrated the existence of two isoforms. 5. The calcium-binding property was assured by a calcium dependent electrophoretic mobility shift and autoradiography of 45Ca(2+)-incubated Western blots. 6.

Chromosome rearrangement patterns of an SD chromosome (SDKona-2) in Drosophila melanogaster caused by hybrid dysgenesis,1427062,10.1139/g92-130,"The types and frequencies of spontaneous chromosome rearrangements caused by hybrid dysgenesis were studied in a second chromosome autosome of Drosophila melanogaster. This second chromosome, being an SD chromosome, had two important advantages over other autosomes for this study: (i) it had the two inversions characteristic of a standard SD-72 chromosome type, which distinguished it from its homolog in polytene chromosome spreads, and (ii) because of the meiotic drive associated with the segregation distorter system, it was preferentially transmitted to the next generation. The chromosome mutation frequency of this chromosome (given the name SDKona-2) was 8.3 and 11.7% in the F2 and F3 generations, respectively. The types of new chromosome rearrangements observed in the first four generations included paracentric inversions, pericentric inversions, duplications, deletions, reciprocal translocations (involving the third chromosome), and transpositions. Small paracentric inversions were the most common type of new rearrangement. Later, over 35 generations, some of these new rearrangements changed, either by becoming more complex or by being replaced with yet another new chromosome rearrangement. Duplications were unstable and were replaced by paracentric inversions whose breakpoints were on either side of the duplication. Transpositions arose both from a single multibreak event and from a series of two-break events.",1992,"J G Ault, J G Ault"
Downstream of the homeotic genes,1346973,,"The homeotic genes of Drosophila melanogaster determine which structures form in each of the body segments. Disrupting the function of the homeotic genes causes body parts found in one domain of the animal to be replaced by body parts normally found elsewhere. Each of the homeotic genes encodes a protein, or a closely related family of proteins, which is capable of binding DNA and controlling the transcriptional activities of downstream genes. The homeotic genes are in the middle of a complex regulatory network, and many of the genes that control homeotic expression have been well characterized. However, very little is known about what comes after the homeotic genes, the downstream genes whose activities are regulated by the homeotic genes. Here, we review the known relationships between the homeotic proteins and the few identified target genes. The details of these interactions may be characteristic and may thus guide the search for additional targets.",1992,"D J Andrew, M P Scott, D J Andrew, M P Scott"
"The binding of mutant actins to profilin, ATP and DNase I",1396697,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1992.tb17274.x,"Twenty-five mutations were created in the Drosophila melanogaster Act88F actin gene by in vitro mutagenesis and the mutant actins expressed in vitro. The affinity of the mutant actins for ATP, profilin and DNase I was determined. They were also tested for conformational changes by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Mutations at positions 364 (highly conserved) and 366 (invariant) caused changes in conformation, reduced ATP binding and increased profilin binding. At position 362 (invariant) only the conservative change from tyrosine to phenylalanine had no effect; other changes at this position affected conformation, ATP and profilin binding. Although only glycine or serine occur naturally at position 368, changes to threonine or glutamine had no effect on the actin. The mutant in which Asp363 was replaced by His and that in which Glu364 was replaced by Lys decreased DNase I binding, yet neither amino acid occurs in the DNase I binding site. Likewise several mutations affect ATP and profilin binding but are distant from the binding sites. We conclude that, although actin has a highly conserved amino acid sequence, individual amino acids can have variable tolerance for substitutions. Also amino acid changes can exert significant effects on the binding of ligands to distant parts of the actin structure.",1992,"D R Drummond, E S Hennessey, J C Sparrow, D R Drummond, E S Hennessey, J C Sparrow"

Until completion of germ band retraction, the four pregnathal segment remnants and their corresponding neuromeres become arranged in an S-shape.

The mtDNA types of their progeny were analysed by selective amplification of the paternal mtDNA fragment possessing a polymorphic restriction site and detecting its cleaved fragments.

A recent extension of that observation to cell lines from complementation group A of Fanconi anemia has established a new cellular phenotype for that disorder. In the current study an analogous enzyme has been analyzed in eight recently isolated Chinese hamster cell lines that are hypersensitive to cross-linking agents. Among these lines. V-H4 and V-B7 are shown to exhibit an enzyme modification analogous to that observed in the mutant Drosophila and human cells.

Protein-tyrosine kinase activity of alternate protein products of the Drosophila Dsrc28C locus,1397284,10.1016/0014-5793(92)81353-n,"The Dsrc28C gene is a unique member of the extensive tyrosine kinase family. Two proteins, p66Dsrc28C and p55Dsrc28C, are encoded by the gene. Each contains a highly conserved tyrosine kinase domain and each lacks the usual amino-terminal myristylation signal. The protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the two proteins was investigated through a recombinant baculovirus expression system. p66Dsrc28C expressed from a recombinant baculovirus phosphorylated a large number of Sf9 cell proteins on tyrosine. A group of proteins of approximately 100 kDa were the preferred substrates. No evidence of p66Dsrc28C autophosphorylation was found. In contrast to p66Dsrc28C, p55Dsrc28C did not exhibit protein-tyrosine kinase activity when expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. A deletion derivative of p66Dsrc28C lacking the SH3 and SH2 domains also failed to phosphorylate Sf9 cell proteins.

A comprehensive study of genic variation in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. VII. Varying rates of genic divergence as revealed by two-dimensional electrophoresis,1584017,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040738,"Four sibling species from the melanogaster subgroup (Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. mauritiana) were studied for genetic divergence, by high-resolution two-dimensional protein electrophoresis (2DE) coupled with ultrasensitive silver staining. A total of eight tissues from larval and adult developmental stages representing both gonadal (germ-line) and nongonadal (somatic) tissues were analyzed for protein divergence between species. Close to 400 polypeptides (protein spots) were scored from each tissue and species, and protein divergence was measured on the basis of qualitative differences (presence/absence) of protein spots in pairwise species comparisons. The observed levels of genic divergence varied among tissues and among species. When larval hemolymph proteins (which are known to be highly polymorphic) were excluded, there was no evidence to suggest that either the larval or adult-stage proteins, as a whole, are more diverged than the other; variation between different tissues rather than between developmental stages appears to be the most significant factor affecting genetic divergence between species. The reproductive tissue (testis and accessory gland) showed more divergence than did the nonreproductive tissue; D. melanogaster testis (from both larvae and adult males) showed the highest level of divergence. In view of the previous observation that D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia show similar but significantly less reproductive isolation from each other than from D. melanogaster, the present results suggest a correlation between the levels of reproductive-tract-protein divergence and the degree of reproductive isolation in these species.",1992,"S Thomas, R S Singh, S Thomas, R S Singh"

Preadult seclusion at certain stages decreased sexual isolation between three of four semispecific pairs. Seclusion effect, or lack thereof, varied with semispecies and with the stage at which seclusion was imposed: the earlier the stage at which seclusion was initiated, the more drastic the effect. In contrast, mixed culturing increased sexual isolation between the one pair of semispecies that was tested.",1992,"Y K Kim, L Ehrman, H R Koepfer, Y K Kim, L Ehrman, H R Koepfer"
The foraging locus: behavioral tests for normal muscle movement in rover and sitter Drosophila melanogaster larvae,1521800,10.1007/BF00132272,"We used Drosophila melanogaster larvae with different alleles at the foraging (for) locus in a variety of behavioral tests to evaluate normal muscle usage of rover and sitter phenotypes. The results show that sitter and lethal sitter alleles of for do not affect larval behavior through a mutation which affects larval muscle usage. In general the behavior of rovers and sitters differed on food but not on non-nutritive substrates. Rovers and sitters moved equally well on non-nutritive substrates, and measures such as the time to roll over and length of forward stride showed no significant strain differences. Larvae with different alleles at for did not differ in body length. Rovers took more strides, not longer ones, than sitters while on foraging substrates. We conclude that differences in larval locomotion during foraging found in larvae with different alleles at for can not be explained on the basis of muscle usage alone. It is more likely that for affects larval ability to perceive or respond to the foraging environment.",1992,"M B Sokolowski, K P Hansell, M B Sokolowski, K P Hansell"
Molecular analysis of cis-regulatory sequences at the alpha-amylase locus in Drosophila melanogaster,1616481,,"The Amylase locus in Drosophila melanogaster contains duplicate, divergently transcribed structural genes for alpha-amylase, AmyA and AmyB. A sensitive and reliable transient expression assay was developed for testing amylase activities produced by exogenous Amy genes in somatically transformed larvae of an amylase-null strain of flies. Alleles tested, AmyA and AmyB, came from recombinant clone lambda Dm65, which contains genomic DNA from a Canton-S strain. The transient assay was used in a deletion analysis aimed at locating cis-regulatory sequences within the 5' region of AmyB. Results suggest that upstream regulatory sequences for correct spatial expression of AmyA and AmyB in third-instar larvae are located within 446 and 430 bp of their respective starts for transcription. A sequence required for high levels of AmyB expression was located within its 5' upstream region between the base pairs at -332 and -219. AmyA does not appear to have a comparable regulatory element in its 5'-flanking sequence. Barely detectable expression of AmyB was observed when it was flanked by only 92 bp of upstream sequence.

Glutamine and glutamate metabolism in normal and heat shock conditions in Drosophila Kc cells: conditions supporting glutamine synthesis maximize heat shock polypeptide expression,1347046,10.1002/jcp.1041500323,"We have previously reported that Drosophila Kc cells require glutamine for maximal expression of heat shock proteins in stressed conditions (Sanders and Kon: J. Cell. Physiol. 146:180-190, 1991). The mechanism of this effect has been investigated by comparing the metabolic utilization of glutamine in conditions which support hsp expression with that of glutamate in conditions where up to 100-fold less hsp is synthesized. This comparison showed that free ammonia was generated by cells incubated in the presence of glutamine in 37 degrees C (heat shock) conditions, but not at 25 degrees C, and not in the presence of glutamate in either normal or heat shock conditions. There was no difference in the amount of [14C]O2 generated from either [14C]-labeled amino acid in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, but three- to four-fold more alanine was synthesized in cells incubated in glutamine than in glutamate. Treating the cells with aminotransferase inhibitors to artificially increase NH3 release raised hsp expression in the presence of glutamate to maximal levels characteristic of glutamine. This potentiation correlated with inhibition of alanine aminotransferase. Since only NH3 production correlated with hsp expression in heat shock conditions in the presence of glutamine, and NH3 addition to glutamate also resulted in maximal hsp expression, we measured glutamine production in glutamate plus NH3 and observed net glutamine synthesis. The supposition that glutamine itself is responsible for the regulatory changes supporting maximal hsp expression was supported by the finding that the glutamine analog, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), mimicked the effects of glutamine. We conclude that glutamine imposes regulatory changes which alter nitrogen metabolism and support hsp expression in Kc cells.",1992,"M M Sanders, C Kon, M M Sanders, C Kon"
Sex determination in the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster: activation of the gene Sex-lethal,8076519,,"The germ line exhibits sexual dimorphism as do the somatic tissues. Cells with the 2X;2A chromosome constitution will follow the oogenic pathway and X;2A cells will develop into sperm. In both somatic and germ-line tissues, the sexual pathway chosen by the cells depends on the gene Sex-lethal (Sxl), whose function is continuously needed for female development. In the soma, the sex of the cells is autonomously determined by the X:A signal while, in the germ line, the sex is determined by cell autonomous (the X:A signal) and somatic inductive signals. Three X-linked genes have been identified, scute (sc), sisterless-a (sis-a) and runt (run), that determine the initial functional state of Sxl in the soma. Using pole cell transplantation, we have tested whether these genes are also needed to activate Sxl in the germ line. We found that germ cells simultaneously heterozygous for sc, sis-a, run and a deficiency for Sxl transplanted into wild-type female hosts develop into functional oocytes. We conclude that the genes sc, sis-a and run needed to activate Sxl in the soma seem not to be required to activate this gene in the germ line; therefore, the X:A signal would be made up by different genes in somatic and germ-line tissues. The Sxlf7M1/Sxlfc females do not have developed ovaries. We have shown that germ cells of this genotype transplanted into wild-type female hosts produce functional oocytes. We conclude that the somatic component of the gonads in Sxlf7M1/Sxlfc females is affected, and consequently germ cells do not develop.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,"B Granadino, P Santamaria, L Sánchez, B Granadino, P Santamaria, L Sánchez"

These truncated RNAs were polyadenylated using putative polyadenylation signals within the 5'-LTR of the inserted retrotransposon. No evidence was found for effects of the retrotransposon insertions on the promoters for transcription of the 6.0 and 2.5 kb RNAs. In f1 and fx, a single gypsy element was found to be inserted at identical sites in the second intron of region encoding the 2.5 kb f RNA and both truncated and wild-type sized RNAs were detected. Recessive mutations at suppressor of forked (su(f)) increased the fraction of wild-type sized RNAs considerably, suggesting that the wild-type su(f) product either stimulates premature termination at the gypsy LTR or inhibits normal splicing. In f36a, a springer element inserted in the third exon of the region encoding the 2.5 kb f RNA completely suppressed the formation of apparently wild-type transcripts.",1993,"S Ishimaru, K Saigo, S Ishimaru, K Saigo"
Hybrid lethal systems in the Drosophila melanogaster species complex. II.

We named it Zhr (Zygotic hybrid rescue). The gene also rescues hybrid females from embryonic lethals in crosses of Drosophila mauritiana females x D. melanogaster males and of Drosophila sechellia females x D. melanogaster males.

"Behavior in light-dark cycles of Drosophila mutants that are arrhythmic, blind, or both",8490212,10.1177/074873049300800106,"Certain of the rhythm mutations in Drosophila melanogaster lead to arrhythmic locomotor activity (and aperiodic eclosion) in constant conditions. In light-dark (LD) cycles, however, such mutants exhibit clear fluctuations between high levels of activity when the lights are on and much lower ones when they are off. Our data, in contrast to some previous conclusions, strongly suggest that period0 (per0) adults are, in LD conditions, merely being ""forced"" into exhibiting periodic behavior. These experiments involved application of 8-, 12-, 16-, and 24-hr LD cycles, in which the arrhythmic mutant could have any of these periodicities imposed upon it, whereas wild-type flies tended to exhibit periods of about 24 hr in cycling conditions whose T values were > 8 hr different from 24. In phase-shift experiments, it was found that Drosophila expressing genotypes associated with rhythmicity achieved a 5-hr advance over a 2-day period following an advanced lights-on; per0 adults altered the phase of their locomotor peaks more rapidly. Against a background of the fact that eyeless or blind flies exhibit normal entrainment, it was hypothesized that double-mutant flies--carrying such visual mutations and per0 as well--should not synchronize to LD cycles, if the forced rhythms seen in the latter single-mutant type are mediated solely by light input through the external photoreceptors. Since an appreciable proportion of the double mutants did synchronize (to LD 12:12), it is thus suggested that the visual cues involved in forcing rhythmicity could be input through the same extraocular photoreceptors that, in general, subserve the fly's rhythm system.",1993,"D A Wheeler, M J Hamblen-Coyle, M S Dushay, J C Hall, D A Wheeler, M J Hamblen-Coyle, M S Dushay, J C Hall"

The HG-related changes in fecundity suggest that flies counteract an increased metabolic demand. 4. Viability is barely affected in HG. 5. These results show that flies remain able to lay viable eggs and to live for a fairly long life, even at high HG levels. 6. The study of three behavioral traits affected by aging (climbing activity, pattern of movement, spontaneous locomotor activity) suggests that flies age faster in HG, while no HG effect is clearly detected at young age. 7.

Gene regulation in Drosophila spermatogenesis: analysis of protein binding at the translational control element TCE,8111973,10.1002/dvg.1020140606,"We have previously identified a 12 nucleotide long sequence element, the TCE, that was demonstrated to be necessary for translational control of expression in the male germ line of Drosophila melanogaster (Schäfer et al., 1990). It is conserved among all seven members of the Mst(3)CGP gene family, that encode structural proteins of the sperm tail. The TCE is invariably located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) at position +28 relative to the transcription start site. In this paper we analyse the mode of action of this element. We show that protein binding occurs at the TCE after incubation with testis protein extracts from Drosophila melanogaster. While several proteins are associated with the translational control element in the RNA, only one of these proteins directly crosslinks to the sequence element. The binding activity is exclusively observed with testis protein extracts but can be demonstrated with testis extracts from other Drosophila species as well, indicating that regulatory proteins involved in translational regulation in the male germ line are conserved. Although binding to the TCE can occur independent of its position relative to the transcription start site of the in vitro transcripts, its function in vivo is not exerted when shifted further downstream within the 5' UTR of a fusion gene. In addition to being a translational control element the TCE also functions as a transcriptional regulator. Consequently, a DNA-protein complex is also formed at the TCE. In contrast to the RNA-protein complexes we find DNA-protein complexes with protein extracts of several tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.",1993,"E Kempe, B Muhs, M Schäfer, E Kempe, B Muhs, M Schäfer"
"Sex-lethal, master and slave: a hierarchy of germ-line sex determination in Drosophila",8187645,,"Female sex determination in the germ line of Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by genes functioning in the soma as well as genes that function within the germ line.

Seven genes required for female-specific splicing of germ-line Sex-lethal+ pre-mRNA are identified. These results together with information about the tissues in which these genes function and whether they control sex determination and viability or just sex determination in the germ line have been used to deduce the genetic hierarchy regulating female germ-line sex determination.

The Drosophila stubarista phenotype is associated with a dosage effect of the putative ribosome-associated protein D-p40 on spineless,7916731,,"We describe the molecular characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster gene stubarista (sta) that encodes the highly conserved putative ribosome-associated protein D-p40. sta maps to cytological position 2A3-B2 on the X chromosome and encodes a protein (D-p40) of 270 amino acids. D-p40 shares 63% identity with the human p40 ribosomal protein. P element-mediated transformation of a 4.4-kb genomic fragment encompassing the 1-kb transcript corresponding to D-p40 was used to rescue both a lethal (sta2) and a viable (sta1) mutation at the stubarista (sta) locus. Developmental analysis of the sta2 mutation implicates a requirement for D-p40 during oogenesis and imaginal development, which is consistent with the expression of sta throughout development. In addition, we have analyzed the basis of the sta1 visible phenotype which consists of shortened antennae and bristles. sta1 is a translocation of the 1E1-2 to 2B3-4 region of the X chromosome onto the third chromosome at 89B21-C4. We provide genetic evidence that Dp(1;3)sta1 is mutant at the spineless (ss) locus and that it is associated with partial D-p40 activity. We demonstrate that sta1 acts as a recessive enhancer of ss; reduction in the amount of D-p40 provided by the transposed X chromosomal region of sta1 reveals a haplo-insufficient phenotype of the otherwise recessive ss mutations. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the enhancing effect observed with Minute mutations, one of which, rp49, has previously been shown to encode a ribosomal protein.",1993,"M B Melnick, E Noll, N Perrimon, M B Melnick, E Noll, N Perrimon"
Sex-lethal autoregulation requires multiple cis-acting elements upstream and downstream of the male exon and appears to depend largely on controlling the use of the male exon 5' splice site,8246990,10.1128/mcb.13.12.7734,"The on/off state of the binary switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl), which controls somatic sexual development in Drosophila melanogaster, is regulated at the level of alternative splicing. In males, in which the gene is off, the default splicing machinery produces nonfunctional mRNAs; in females, in which the gene is on, the autoregulatory activity of the Sxl proteins directs the splicing machinery to produce functional mRNAs. We have used germ line transformation to analyze the mechanism of default and regulated splicing. Our results demonstrate that a blockage mechanism is employed in Sxl autoregulation. However, in contrast to transformer, in which Sxl appears to function by preventing the interaction of splicing factors with the default 3' splice site, a different strategy is used in autoregulation. (i) Multiple cis-acting elements, both upstream and downstream of the male exon, are required. (ii) These cis-acting elements are distant from the splice sites they regulate, suggesting that the Sxl protein cannot function in autoregulation by directly competing with splicing factors for interaction with the regulated splice sites. (iii) The 5' splice site of the male exon appears to be dominant in regulation while the 3' splice site plays a subordinate role.",1993,"J I Horabin, P Schedl, J I Horabin, P Schedl"
The specification of sensory neuron identity in Drosophila,8343140,10.1002/bies.950150502,"Different types of sense organs are present on the larva of Drosophila. Several genes that specify the type of sense organ that will form at a particular position have been recently identified. Here we review the functional and molecular analyses of these genes, and summarize the evidence which supports a role in the choice of which type of organ will be formed. Most or all of these genes are required for the appropriate specification of adult as well as larval sense organs, suggesting that the larval and adult systems share many gene requirements. Interestingly, the specifying genes identified so far in the peripheral nervous system are also expressed in subsets of cells in the central nervous system, where they might have similar roles.",1993,"A Ghysen, C Dambly-Chaudière, A Ghysen, C Dambly-Chaudière"
"Molecules and cognition: the latterday lessons of levels, language, and lac. Evolutionary overview of brain structure and function in some vertebrates and invertebrates",8331341,10.1002/neu.480240610,"The characteristics of the nervous systems of a number of organisms in different phyla are examined at the recombinant DNA, protein, neuroanatomic, neurophysiological, and cognitive levels. Among the invertebrates, special attention is paid to the advantages as well as the shortcomings of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the sea hare Aplysia californica, the octopus Octopus vulgaris, and the squid Loligo pealei. Among vertebrates, the focus is on Homo sapiens, the mouse Mus musculus, the rat Rattus norvegicus, the cat Felis catus, the macaque monkey Macaca fascicularis, the barn owl Tyto alba, and the zebrafish Brachydanio rerio. Vertebrate nervous systems have also been compared in fossil vs. extant organisms. I conclude that complex nervous systems arose in the Early Cambrian via a big bang that was underpinned by a modular method of construction involving massive pleiotropy of gene circuits. This rapidity of construction had enormous implications for the degrees of freedom that were subsequently available to evolving nervous systems. I also conclude that at the level of neuronal populations and interactions of neuropiles there is no model system between phyla except at the basic macromolecular level. Further, I argue that to achieve a significant understanding of the functions of extant nervous systems we need to concentrate on fewer organisms in greater depth and manipulate genomes via transgenic technologies to understand the behavioral outputs that are possible from an organism. Finally, I analyze the concepts of ""perceptual categorization"" and ""information processing"" and the difficulties involved in the extrapolation of computer analogies to sophisticated nervous systems.",1993,"G L Miklos, G L Miklos"
Genes controlling cellular polarity in Drosophila,8049482,,"The control of cellular polarity is one of the least understood aspects of development. Genes have been identified in Drosophila that affect the polarity of embryonic cells in all three axes, apical-basal, proximodistal and dorsoventral. Mutations that affect adult polarity are also known and mutant flies show several types of pattern alteration, including rotations and mirror-image duplications. Imaginal discs are much greater in size, however, than the embryo, and adult structures contain very large numbers of cells, many of which are not visibly differentiated with respect to their immediate neighbours. In regions where neighbouring cells are similar to each other, the imaginal polarity mutants alter the orientation of bristles and hairs, but do not change cellular fate. Other regions, such as the tarsal segments of the legs, the ommatidia of the eye and the bracketed bristle sockets on the tibia, behave as discrete fields. Within these fields, fine-scale mirror-image reversals and pattern duplications are observed, analogous to those caused by the embryonic segment polarity mutants. Thus, the polarised transmission of information can affect either orientation or fate depending on whether cells are differentiated from their immediate neighbours. Cellular polarity will be critically dependent on both the internal cytoskeletal architecture and the spatial organisation of signal transduction molecules within the cell membrane.",1993,"D Gubb, D Gubb"
"The three-dimensional structure of the central region in a synaptonemal complex: a comparison between rat and two insect species, Drosophila melanogaster and Blaps cribrosa",8149809,10.1007/BF00650894,"The highly ordered central region of the synaptonemal complex (SC) in Blaps cribrosa has recently been studied by electron microscope tomography (EMT), and a simple three-dimensional model presented. Using the same experimental approach we have now compared the central region in Blaps with the central regions in Drosophila melanogaster and rat. In all three species, the SCs exhibit a central element (CE) flanked by two lateral elements (LEs). The central region between the two LEs is crossed by transverse filaments (TFs). The Blaps CE element is the most ordered one with a well-defined ladder-like structure with two longitudinal components bridged by a number of regularly spaced transverse components, the rungs of the ladder. At the junctions between the longitudinal and transverse components there are prominent dense structures. The CE is multi-layered with the ladders of the separate layers in approximate register. In Drosophila the transverse CE components are as distinct and well organized as in Blaps, while in rat they are present but are less frequent and less well ordered. The longitudinal CE components in Drosophila are often fragmented and even more so in rat. The tomographic analysis revealed that in all three species the central region contains the same structural units: a single TF associated with two short pillars (or globules), which correspond to the junction structures. A fibrous lattice connects the two pillars/globules on the same TF forming the transverse CE component and those on adjacent TFs forming the longitudinal CE component; fibers between pillars/globules also link consecutive CE layers together. In the longitudinal component the number of fibrous bridges between the pillars/globules is related to the conspicuousness of the longitudinal component, i.e. Blaps has most, Drosophila almost as many, and rat considerably fewer bridges. We conclude that the central region in rat, Drosophila and Blaps contains the same basic structural unit but the degree of order and concentration of the units differ: a higher density seems to be accompanied by a higher order within the CE.",1993,"K Schmekel, U Skoglund, B Daneholt, K Schmekel, U Skoglund, B Daneholt"
The role of the enhancer of split complex during cell fate determination in Drosophila,8049468,,"Molecular and genetic data predict that the Enhancer of split locus functions at the end of a pathway dictating appropriate cell fate determination in a number of developmental contexts. We have sought to dissect the role individual member genes of the complex play through a molecular analysis. Of the two principle class of genes, the first, members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class of proteins are expressed in specific regions of the embryo in subtle, overlapping patterns in cells that will differentiate as epidermis. The second, groucho, a member of the WD40 class of proteins, is expressed more generally. Immunoprecipitation experiments do not implicate groucho in G protein mediated signal transduction, a known function of many WD40 type proteins. Instead, the nuclear localisation of the protein suggests a relationship to the bHLH members of the complex. Differences in expression of the bHLH genes between neurogenic mutants implies two pathways to their activation during epidermal determination.",1993,"F Tata, D A Hartley, F Tata, D A Hartley"
Drosophila suzukii contains a peptide homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide and functional in both species,8353518,10.1016/0965-1748(93)90030-v,"A peptide homologous to the Drosophila melanogaster sex-peptide (SP) was isolated from Drosophila suzukii accessory glands and its amino acid sequence determined.

In the D. suzukii sex-peptide, however, five additional amino acids are inserted after amino acid 7. Based on the sequence of the peptide, a cDNA coding for the D. suzukii peptide was isolated by PCR. Sequence analysis of the cDNA confirmed the SP amino acid sequence determined by peptide sequencing.

Molecular characterization and cytonuclear disequilibria of two Drosophila subobscura mitochondrial haplotypes,8270202,10.1139/g93-117,"According to restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA, Drosophila subobscura shows a polymorphism that consists of two frequent haplotypes that are evenly distributed all over the Old World and several rare haplotypes never present in more than one locality. To ascertain the causes responsible for such distribution, three different mtDNA fragments from haplotypes I and II sampled in a population from Zürich have been partially sequenced. Only three silent nucleotide changes have been detected in the ND5 gene. One of them implies the loss of the HaeIII restriction site, which differentiates haplotype I from haplotype II. On the basis of these results as well as on others involving the geographic distribution of haplotypes I and II, they can be considered phenotypically equivalent. The sequencing study has been complemented with the analysis of cytonuclear disequilibria between mitochondrial haplotypes and different nuclear loci in four D. subobscura populations. As expected, no significant cytonuclear disequilibria have been found between haplotypes I and II.

Synergistic activation of the HTLV1 LTR Ets-responsive region by transcription factors Ets1 and Sp1,8458329,,"Ets1 is the prototype of a family of transcriptional activators whose activity depends on the binding to specific DNA sequences characterized by an invariant GGA core sequence. We have previously demonstrated that transcriptional activation by Ets1 of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is strictly dependent on the binding of Ets1 to two sites, ERE-A and ERE-B, localized in a 44 bp long Ets-responsive region (ERR1). We report here that the activity of ERR1 as an efficient Ets1 response element in HeLa cells also depends on the integrity of an Sp1 binding site localized immediately upstream of ERE-A. The response to Ets1 of an element restricted to the SP1/ERE-A binding sites is also strictly dependent on both the Ets1 and Sp1 binding sites. In vitro, Sp1 and Ets1 are shown to cooperate to form a ternary complex with the SP1/ERE-A element. Reconstitution experiments in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cells show that Ets1 and Sp1 act synergistically to activate transcription from either the ERR1 or the SP1/ERE-A elements and that synergy requires the binding of both Sp1 and Ets1 to their cognate sites. SP1/ERE-A elements are found in the enhancer/promoter region of several cellular genes, suggesting that synergy between Ets1 and Sp1 is not restricted to the ERR1 region of the HTLV1 LTR. These results strengthen the notion that Ets1 as well as other members of the Ets family usually function as components of larger transcription complexes to regulate the activity of a variety of viral and cellular genes.",1993,"A Gégonne, R Bosselut, R A Bailly, J Ghysdael, A Gégonne, R Bosselut, R A Bailly, J Ghysdael"

"A novel, tissue-specific integrin subunit, beta nu, expressed in the midgut of Drosophila melanogaster",8076521,,"The integrins are a family of cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix proteins and counter-receptors on other cells. We have used the polymerase chain reaction to identify a novel integrin receptor beta subunit in Drosophila melanogaster. The deduced amino acid sequence of this subunit, which we have termed beta v (beta-neu), indicates that it has several unusual properties. The beta v subunit is roughly 33% identical with each of the previously sequenced vertebrate and Drosophila beta subunits and is lacking four of the 56 cysteine residues characteristic of most members of this protein family. The expression of the beta v gene is strikingly restricted. It is temporally regulated, with maximal expression occurring at 12-15 hours of embryonic development. In situ hybridization analyses and antibody localization on whole-mount embryos reveal that beta v expression is tissue-specific and confined to the developing midgut endoderm and its precursors during embryogenesis. Tissue specificity of expression is maintained through later stages of development as beta v transcripts are found exclusively in the larval midgut. Within this structure, beta v transcripts are especially concentrated in the cells of the midgut imaginal islands which give rise to the adult midgut.",1993,"G H Yee, R O Hynes, G H Yee, R O Hynes"

In the mutant fly, mitochondrial proline oxidase activity is reduced and has kinetic properties different from those of the wild type, providing further evidence that the gene encodes proline oxidase. Indeed, the free proline level in mutant flies is elevated. When the mutant is rescued by transformation, the proline oxidase and free proline levels, as well as the motor and phototactic behavior, are restored to normal. During embryonic development the sluggish-A transcript is predominantly expressed in the nervous system.

Activation and repression of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase distal transcription by two steroid hormone receptor superfamily members binding to a common response element,8479913,10.1093/nar/21.7.1619,"Developmental activation of the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) distal promoter is controlled by the Adh adult enhancer (AAE). Within this 150 bp, complex enhancer is a small (12 bp) positive cis-acting element that is required for high levels of distal transcription in adult flies and ADH-expressing tissue culture cells. We previously reported that the steroid receptor superfamily member FTZ-F1 binds to this site. We have identified a second steroid receptor superfamily member, DHR39, which also binds to this site. DHR39 is expressed throughout development in transcripts of several sizes. In situ hybridization to embryos has shown that DHR39 RNA is found primarily in the central nervous system, and not in embryonic tissues that express ADH. FTZ-F1 RNA, however, shows temporal-specific patterns similar to those of the distal promoter. FTZ-F1 and DHR39 have identical amino acids in the 'P-box' of the DNA binding domain, suggesting that they have identical DNA recognition characteristics. By electrophoretic mobility shift analysis we show that a DHR39 fusion protein binds specifically to two FTZ-F1 binding sites. By over expressing the full length DHR39 protein in a transient co-transfection assay we have shown that it represses distal Adh expression in a dosage- and binding site-dependent manner. Over expression of an alternative DHR39 open reading frame that lacks part of the putative ligand binding domain does not alter Adh expression. In contrast, over expression of FTZ-F1 specifically activates distal Adh expression.",1993,"S Ayer, N Walker, M Mosammaparast, J P Nelson, B Z Shilo, C Benyajati, S Ayer, N Walker, M Mosammaparast, J P Nelson, B Z Shilo, C Benyajati"
Cloning of a crustacean myosin heavy chain isoform: exclusive expression in fast muscle,8277231,10.1002/jez.1402670605,"A clone of a fast isoform of myosin heavy chain (HC) gene was isolated from a cDNA1 expression library made from mRNA purified from the deep abdominal flexor muscle of the lobster, Homarus americanus. The cDNA (1.5 kb) contained the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and the coding sequence for the last 413 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology with that of myosin HCs from Drosophila (73% identity), nematode (57% identity), and vertebrates (49% identities). Hydropathy plots showed a 28-amino acid periodicity that is consistent with the alpha-helical coiled coil structure of the rod region of native myosin. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed that the fast myosin HC isoform was expressed only in fast fibers; the probes did not hybridize to mRNA from slow fibers. The message consisted of a single transcript of 6.6 kb. The intracellular localization of the fast myosin mRNA was not uniform. The mRNA was largely confined to the intermyofibrillar spaces and to the subsarcolemmal cytoplasm of the fiber periphery and large infoldings of the cell membrane. Within these regions the mRNA was concentrated in the cytoplasm immediately surrounding the nuclei.

Delays in anaphase initiation occur in individual nuclei of the syncytial Drosophila embryo,8257792,10.1091/mbc.4.9.885,"The syncytial divisions of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo lack some of the well established cell-cycle checkpoints. It has been suggested that without these checkpoints the divisions would display a reduced fidelity. To test this idea, we examined division error frequencies in individuals bearing an abnormally long and rearranged second chromosome, designated C(2)EN. Relative to a normal chromosome, this chromosome imposes additional structural demands on the mitotic apparatus in both the early syncytial embryonic divisions and the later somatic divisions. We demonstrate that the C(2)EN chromosome does not increase the error frequency of the late larva neuroblast divisions. However, in the syncytial embryonic nuclear divisions, the C(2)EN chromosome produces a 10-fold increase in division errors relative to embryos with a normal karyotype. During late anaphase of the neuroblast divisions, the sister C(2)EN chromosomes cleanly separate from one another. In contrast, during late anaphase of the syncytial divisions in C(2)EN-bearing nuclei, large amounts of chromatin often lag on the metaphase plate. Live analysis of C(2)EN-bearing embryos demonstrates that individual nuclei in the syncytial population of dividing nuclei often delay in their initiation of anaphase. These delays frequently lead to division errors. Eventually the products of the nuclei delayed in anaphase sink inward and are removed from the dividing population of syncytial nuclei. These results suggest that the Drosophila embryo may be equipped with mechanisms that monitor the fidelity of the syncytial nuclear divisions. Unlike checkpoints that rely on cell cycle delays to identify and correct division errors, these embryonic mechanisms rely on cell cycle delays to identify and discard the products of division errors.",1993,"W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli, W Sullivan, D R Daily, P Fogarty, K J Yook, S Pimpinelli"
Functional significance of a family of protein kinases encoded at the shaggy locus in Drosophila,8467811,,"The characterization of the structurally complex gene shaggy is presented.

The gene comprises two transcription units that give rise to 10 transcripts and five different proteins with a common kinase catalytic domain and overlapping patterns of expression during development. Mutational analysis of shaggy defines a single complementation group, lethality of which is associated with the loss of two major shaggy proteins. These studies allow the first definition of a true null allele. Two proteins may fulfill maternal requirements. Phenotypes of flies expressing individual shaggy proteins revealed that although there is some redundancy between the different forms they do not all carry out identical functions in vivo. However, under experimental conditions, a single form of the protein was able to carry out all known requirements. This protein probably also functions as part of a signal transduction cascade in the imaginal neuroepithelium, where cells have to choose between epidermal and neural fates.",1993,"L Ruel, V Pantesco, Y Lutz, P Simpson, M Bourouis, L Ruel, V Pantesco, Y Lutz, P Simpson, M Bourouis"

Wild-type p53 has sequence-specific DNA binding activity. We demonstrate that upon binding DNA wild-type p53 changes conformation at both its N- and C-termini, such that it adopts a 'mutant'-like conformation. Very few of the known DNA binding proteins exhibit long-range conformational changes upon binding to DNA. Such proteins, like the Drosophila heat shock transcription factor, have DNA binding domains whose activity is regulated by conformation.

The resulting deletion, B52(28), is confined to the B52 gene and its neighbor the Hrb87F gene. Second-instar larvae homozygous for the deletion are deficient in both B52 mRNA and protein. The B52 null mutant is lethal at the first- and second-instar larval stages. Germ line transformation of Drosophila flies with B52 genomic DNA rescues this lethality. Thus, B52 is an essential gene and has a critical role in Drosophila development. Larvae deficient in B52 are still capable of splicing the five endogenous pre-mRNAs tested here, including both constitutively and alternatively spliced genes.

The 1.1-kb RNA, on the other hand, is predominantly expressed during embryogenesis and in the neural tissues of late embryo, larva and adult. Moderate expression of this RNA is also found in the imaginal discs and other larval tissues.

Sequence analysis of the corresponding genomic DNA fragment showed one short intron existing in the coding region as in the DMC1 gene, but not in the RAD51 gene.

Calpain localization changes in coordination with actin-related cytoskeletal changes during early embryonic development of Drosophila,7929201,,"Calpain, a calcium-dependent intracellular protease, was identified in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila calpain has an amino acid sequence highly homologous to those of mammalian calpains and exhibits a distinct domain structure consisting of cysteine protease and calcium-binding domains. Specific antibodies raised against a recombinant calpain fragment were used to identify the localization of calpain in developing Drosophila embryos. Calpain was first detected near the anterior pole and in posterior region of the embryo just after fertilization. The anterior calpain disappeared during the cleavage cycles. On the other hand, the posterior calpain moved to the posterior pole when polar buds were formed, and condensed just below the pole cells. At cleavage cycles 8 and 9, when nuclei reached the egg surface, calpain was localized between the nuclei at the surface beneath the precleavage furrows. Co-staining experiments with anti-actin antibody revealed that calpain condenses specifically at the edge of and between actin caps that underlie the plasma membrane immediately above each nucleus. These results indicate that calpain is involved in the dynamic changes in the embryonic cytoskeleton, especially actin-related structures, during early embryogenesis prior to cellularization.",1994,"Y Emori, K Saigo, Y Emori, K Saigo"
Differential regulation of P and hobo mobile elements by two laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster,8026739,10.1017/s0016672300032237,"Analysis of the transposition behaviour of the P and hobo elements borne by the 31.1/CyL4 MRF (P), 23.5 delta/CyL4 MRF (hobo) and 23.5*/Cy MRF (hobo) strains in the progeny of dysgenic crosses with two ME laboratory strains (Berlin-k and dp b cn bw) at 25 degrees C revealed that: (a) the two ME laboratory strains affect differently the transposition rates of P and hobo elements. More precisely, P element transposition is higher in heterozygotes with dp b cn bw than in those with Berlin-k. In contrast, the transposition rate of hobo elements is higher in Berlin-k than in dp b cn bw heterozygotes. (b) Like P, hobo has the potential to transpose at high frequencies and to nonhomologous chromosomes. (c) The dysgenically inactive hobo elements of the 31.1 MRF strain transpose more frequently than the dysgenically active hobo elements of the 23.5 MRF strains in certain crosses. (d) There are insertion hot spots for P and hobo elements. For the P elements there are enough data to suggest that the insertion hot spots are different in the two EM strains.

OS9: a novel olfactory gene of Drosophila expressed in two olfactory organs,8021646,10.1002/neu.480250208,"A novel olfactory gene, OS9, has been identified in Drosophila by subtractive hybridization. OS9 transcripts have been detected in the third antennal segment, the primary olfactory organ in Drosophila, and in the maxillary palp, which has recently been shown to have olfactory function. The OS9 gene thus represents a molecular link between two distinct olfactory tissues in Drosophila. Little if any OS9 expression has been detected in other segments of the antenna or in other tissues examined. The gene is located in region 38AB on the cytogenetic map. OS9 encodes a protein of 159 amino acids, which contains a putative leucine zipper. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the C-terminal half of the encoded protein react with a 24 kD antennal protein. Antisera raised against both C-terminal and N-terminal halves of the OS9 protein appear to react with cell nuclei in both the third antennal segment and the maxillary palp; interestingly, both antisera also stain cells in the head, including photoreceptor nuclei, as if OS9 were an olfactory-specific member of a family of nuclear proteins, possibly transcription factors.",1994,"D Raha, J Carlson, D Raha, J Carlson"

Up to now, the cell markers used to distinguish cells of the two genotypes have only been applicable to specific experimental situations (e.g., only in adult wings). We have designed a general purpose cell marker for mosaic analysis. It consists of the bacterial LacZ gene expressed under the control of the constitutive promoter of the Drosophila armadillo gene. Transformants carrying this fusion gene express beta-galactosidase in all tissue and at all stages analyzed. Zygotic expression is detectable as early as gastrulation. In mosaics obtained by nuclear transplantation, cells carrying the transgene are easily distinguished from beta-galactosidase-negative host cells.

Fine structure analyses of the Drosophila and Saccharomyces heat shock factor--heat shock element interactions,8121800,10.1093/nar/22.2.167,"Heat shock genes are activated by the binding of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) to heat shock elements (HSEs), consisting of arrays of the 5-bp unit NGAAN arranged as inverted repeats. Here, we have investigated the interaction of the 5-bp unit with HSFs of Drosophila and Saccharomyces. Mutations within the conserved, central trinucleotide GAA reduce the relative binding affinity of both HSFs. In addition, the base at position 1 (N1) also influences binding, with a strong preference for an A at this position. Methylation interference initially indicated that HSF contacts A1 in the minor groove, but interacts with the immediately adjacent base G2 in the major groove. Further characterization of this apparently abrupt minor to major groove transition by substitution of A1 with an inosine, shows that HSF contacts A1 in the major groove. We offer an explanation for this apparent contradiction and propose that HSF recognizes the HSE primarily through contacts within the major groove of the DNA helix. Finally, based on these observations and a re-evaluation of the base frequencies and criteria for consensus sequence assignment, we propose that the sequence AGAAN more accurately represents the consensus HSE motif.",1994,"M Fernandes, H Xiao, J T Lis, M Fernandes, H Xiao, J T Lis"
The relationship between DNA structural variation and activities of P elements in P and Q strains of Drosophila melanogaster,7814262,10.1038/hdy.1994.168,"To characterize the relationship between P element activities and their structures, we cloned P elements from genomic libraries of three isogenic P and Q strains derived from natural populations in Japan. These P elements were mapped with BamHI, AvaII and PstI and were classified by their size. The majority of P elements cloned were classified as either complete or relatively small P elements rather than medium size. The numbers of full length (2.9 kb) P elements per haploid genome of NP280 (P), AK194 (weak P) and WY113 (Q) were at least four, five and one, respectively. However, the 2.9 kb P element of WY113 was thought to be defective since this strain has no transposase activity. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the ORF 3-deleted P element is essential for P cytotype determination in WY113. A similar P element also exists in NP280, and this may have an important role for P cytotype determination in this strain. Two and one copies of the KP element, a deletion derivative of the P element, were found in NP280 and AK194, respectively. One of four complete P elements in NP280 was fully sequenced, and the base sequence was completely identical to that of p pi 25.1 originally derived from the U.S.A. This result is consistent with the notion that these P elements have a relatively recent origin in Drosophila melanogaster.",1994,"E Nitasaka, T Yamazaki, E Nitasaka, T Yamazaki"
A method for analysis of gene expression patterns,7513971,10.1006/abio.1994.1045,"mRNA can be copied into cDNA with the use of reverse transcriptase so that the relative abundance of individual mRNAs is reflected in the cDNA product. With further manipulation a replica of the mRNA expression pattern can be duplicated into a radioactive double-stranded DNA probe. DNA from a series of genes inserted into plasmids can be fixed to a membrane using a slot blot manifold and probed with the RNA-derived DNA probe. The intensity of the hybridization signal for a given gene is a result of its relative abundance in the RNA-derived DNA probe. Quantitation can be achieved through the use of housekeeping genes as baseline monitors. Inclusion of vector sequences can negate any spurious hybridization to vector rather than insert sequences. We have successfully used this method to obtain gene expression patterns for RNA isolated from diverse sources including rodent tissues, various cell lines, and Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans samples. Northern blots have verified the results obtained.

"The adult enhancer factor-1, a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional repressor, modulates the promoter activity of the rat class-I alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene",7959011,10.1016/0378-1119(94)90170-8,"Expression of the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene (ADH) in the adult fat body is controlled by the ADH adult enhancer site (AAE). The D. melanogaster transcription repressor, adult enhancer factor-1 (AEF-1), binds to AAE at a site which overlaps with a sequence recognized by the mammalian transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha [C/EBP alpha; Falb and Maniatis, Genes Dev. 6 (1992a) 454-465]. C/EBP alpha also activates the promoter of the rat class-I ADH gene in a sequence-specific manner [Potter et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 285 (1991a) 246-251]. In this study, we explored the possibility that D. melanogaster AEF-1 influences transcription of the rat class-I ADH. By DNase I footprint analysis, bacterially produced AEF-1 protects a region of DNA between nucleotides (nt) -22 and -36 of the rat class-I ADH promoter (pADH), just 5' to the binding site of C/EBP alpha, a result confirmed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Co-transfection of a rat pADH-CAT reporter construct with expression vectors containing C/EBP alpha, AEF-1, or both, indicates that AEF-1 inhibits induction of the rat pADH by C/EBP alpha. Moreover, rat liver nuclear extracts appear to contain AEF-1-like-binding activities to AAE by EMSA. These experiments suggest an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which AEF-1 modulates expression of the D. melanogaster and rat ADH genes.",1994,"J J Potter, E Mezey, V W Yang, J J Potter, E Mezey, V W Yang"

In the rat, a structurally homologous gene (RHL) behaves as an immediate-early gene in its response to growth factors and can, like that in Drosophila, suppress neuronal differentiation events. Here, we report the genomic cloning of the human hairy gene homolog (HRY). The coding region of the gene is contained within four exons. The predicted amino acid sequence reveals only four amino acid differences between the human and rat genes. Analysis of the DNA sequence 5' to the coding region reveals a putative untranslated exon.

In this paper we show that the dsxRE can function as a Tra and Tra2-independent splicing enhancer in vitro when located within 150 nucleotides of the 3' splice site. Based on the relative levels of SR proteins that bind stably to the dsxRE in the presence or absence of Tra and Tra2, we propose that the constitutive splicing activity of the dsxRE is mediated by its weak interactions with SR proteins and possibly other general splicing factors. In contrast, Tra and Tra2 allow the dsxRE to function at a distance from the intron by stabilizing the interactions between these proteins and the dsxRE.",1994,"M Tian, T Maniatis, M Tian, T Maniatis"

The detector works by utilising the detector pad as a variable capacitor which forms part of an RC oscillator. Its capacitance changes as the fly comes in contact with it and this change in capacitance is detected by the circuit. The detector uses cheap and readily available components and can be constructed without expert knowledge in electronics. It can be used to detect and determine the timing of the jump of a fly escaping in response to, say, a visual stimulus. It can also be used for screening of mutants of Drosophila which show altered escape responses and for monitoring locomotion of small animals.",1994,"M F Snowball, M H Holmqvist, M F Snowball, M H Holmqvist"
Modification of the Drosophila heterochromatic mutation brownDominant by linkage alterations,8150283,,"The variegating mutation brownDominant (bwD) of Drosophila melanogaster is associated with an insertion of heterochromatin into chromosome arm 2R at 59E, the site of the bw gene. Mutagenesis produced 150 dominant suppressors of bwD variegation. These fall into two classes: unlinked suppressors, which also suppress other variegating mutations; and linked chromosome rearrangements, which suppress only bwD. Some rearrangements are broken at 59E, and so might directly interfere with variegation caused by the heterochromatic insertion at that site. However, most rearrangements are translocations broken proximal to bw within the 52D-57D region of 2R. Translocation breakpoints on the X chromosome are scattered throughout the X euchromatin, while those on chromosome 3 are confined to the tips. This suggests that a special property of the X chromosome suppresses bwD variegation, as does a distal autosomal location. Conversely, two enhancers of bwD are caused by translocations from the same part of 2R to proximal heterochromatin, bringing the bwD heterochromatic insertion close to the chromocenter with which it strongly associates. These results support the notion that heterochromatin formation at a genetic locus depends on its location within the nucleus.",1994,"P B Talbert, C D LeCiel, S Henikoff, P B Talbert, C D LeCiel, S Henikoff"
A role for the segment polarity gene shaggy-zeste white 3 in the specification of regional identity in the developing wing of Drosophila,8125190,10.1006/dbio.1994.1081,"The Drosophila segment polarity gene known as shaggy or zeste white 3 encodes a ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine protein kinase which is critical for a number of important developmental processes. In the developing wing blade, clones of cells lacking the normal shaggy-zeste white 3 product form dense tufts of margin-like bristles and bristle precursors. In a previous study I hypothesized that this phenotype could be best explained as a transformation in the regional identity of wing blade cells to one resembling that found along the normal wing margin. A number of genes have recently been identified which are expressed exclusively or at higher levels along the normal wing margin; in this study I will show that two of these genes, vestigial and scalloped, are overexpressed at margin-like levels in shaggy-zeste white 3 clones. This phenotype does not depend upon the formation of ectopic bristle precursors and occurs in clones lacking both shaggy-zeste white 3 and the entire achaete-scute complex. As vestigial and scalloped are both involved in early patterning events prior to the stages of bristle specification, these results strongly suggest that shaggy-zeste white 3 is required for the normal specification or maintenance of regional identity in the developing wing blade. The margin-like transformation is, however, partial, since the expression of apterous (in pupal wings) and wingless and cut (at late third instar) was not reliably altered in shaggy-zeste white 3 clones. It has been suggested that shaggy-zeste white 3 is involved in a wingless signaling pathway in the embryo; a model is discussed in which shaggy-zeste white 3 acts downstream of localized apterous and wingless expression to specify or maintain margin identity in the wing.",1994,"S S Blair, S S Blair"
Evidence for alternating head catalysis by kinesin during microtubule-stimulated ATP hydrolysis,8041710,10.1073/pnas.91.15.6865,"The N-terminal 392 amino acids of the Drosophila kinesin alpha subunit (designated DKH392) form a dimer in solution that releases only one of its two tightly bound ADP molecules on association with a microtubule, whereas a shorter monomeric construct (designated DKH340) releases > or = 95% of its one bound ADP on association with a microtubule. This half-site reactivity of dimeric DKH392 is observed over a wide range of ratios of DKH392 to microtubules and steady-state ATPase rates, indicating that it is characteristic of the mechanism of microtubule-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and not the result of a fortuitous balance of rate constants. When [alpha-32P]ATP is included in the medium, incorporation of 32P label into the pool of ADP that is bound to the complex of DKH392 and microtubules occurs rapidly enough for the bound ADP to be an intermediate on the main pathway of ATP hydrolysis. These and other results are consistent with the half-site reactivity being a consequence of the tethering of dimeric DKH392 to the microtubule through one head domain, which is attached in a rigor-like manner without bound nucleotide, whereas the other head is not attached to the microtubule and still contains a tightly bound ADP. An intermediate of this nature and the tight binding of DKH392 to microtubules in the presence of ATP suggest a mechanism for directed motility in which the head domains of dimeric DKH392 alternate in a sequential manner.",1994,"D D Hackney, D D Hackney"

Mutations in some Polycomb group genes of Drosophila interfere with regulation of segmentation genes,7915818,10.1007/BF00583898,"Mutations in several Polycomb (Pc) group genes cause maternal-effect or zygotic segmentation defects, suggesting that Pc group genes may regulate the segmentation genes of Drosophila. We show that individuals doubly heterozygous for mutations in polyhomeotic and six other Pc group genes show gap, pair rule, and segment polarity segmentation defects. We examined double heterozygous combinations of Pc group and segmentation mutations for enhancement of adult and embryonic segmentation defects. Posterior sex combs and polyhomeotic interact with Krüppel and enhance embryonic phenotypes of hunchback and knirps, and polyhomeotic enhances even-skipped. Surprisingly, flies carrying duplications of extra sex combs (esc), that were heterozygous for mutations of even-skipped (eve), were extremely subvital. Embryos and surviving adults of this genotype showed strong segmentation defects in even-numbered segments. Antibody studies confirm that expression of eve is suppressed by duplications of esc. However, esc duplications have no effect on other gap or pair rule genes tested. To our knowledge, this is only the second triplo-abnormal phenotype associated with Pc group genes. Duplications of nine other Pc group genes have no detectable effect on eve. Expression of engrailed (en) was abnormal in the central nervous systems of most Pc group mutants. These results support a role for Pc genes in regulation of some segmentation genes, and suggest that esc may act differently from other Pc group genes.",1994,"J McKeon, E Slade, D A Sinclair, N Cheng, M Couling, H W Brock, J McKeon, E Slade, D A Sinclair, N Cheng, M Couling, H W Brock"
Mammalian meiotic recombination: a reexamination,7989033,10.1007/BF00206950,"Recombination nodules (RNs) are small electron-dense structures associated with the synaptonemal complex. Two types have been identified: early RNs present during zygonema-early pachynema, which are thought to be involved in gene conversion and synaptic initiation, and late RNs present during mid-to-late pachynema, which are thought to be involved in reciprocal recombination leading to chiasma formation. In organisms as diverse as Sodaria, Drosophila, and plants there is indeed a close correlation between the observed number of late RNs and crossovers, or their cytogenetic manifestation, chiasmata. However, as this reexamination of the human data shows, there is not a similar correlation in mammals. Instead, there is a severe deficiency in RNs in eutherian males and marsupial females near chromosome ends and other recombinational ""hot spots"" (defined genetically), or ""localized chiasmata"" (defined cytogenetically). Many of these sites of hyper-recombination correspond to sites of telomere or telomere-associated sequences. Together these observations suggest the possibility of a second, mechanistically different, recombination pathway that does not involve RNs, but may directly involve telomere or telomere-associated sequences. This pathway may be responsible for sex-specific hot-spots of recombination observed at highly localized sites throughout the genome.",1994,"T Ashley, T Ashley"

Cpn60 is exclusively localized into mitochondria of rat liver and embryonic Drosophila cells,8904317,10.1002/jcb.240590212,"Several reports have claimed that the mitochondrial chaperonin cpn60, or a close homolog, is also present in some other subcellular compartments of the eukaryotic cell. Immunoelectron microscopy studies, using a polyclonal serum against cpn60, revealed that the protein is exclusively localized within the mitochondria of rat liver and embryonic Drosophila cells (SL2). Furthermore, no cpn60 immunoreactive material could be found within the nucleus of SL2 cells subjected to a 1 h 37 degrees C heat-shock treatment. In contrast to these findings, immunoelectron microscopy studies, using a cpn60 monoclonal antibody, revealed mitochondrial and extramitochondrial (plasma membrane, nucleus) immunoreactive material in rat liver cells. Surprisingly, the monoclonal antibody also reacted with fixed proteins of the mature red blood cell. The monoclonal antibody, as well as cpn60 polyclonal sera, only recognize mitochondrial cpn60 in Western blots of liver proteins. Furthermore, none of the cpn60 antibodies used in this study recognized blotted proteins from rat red blood cells. Therefore, we suggest that the reported extramitochondrial localization of cpn60 in metazoan cells may be due to cross-reactivity of some of cpn60 antibodies with conformational epitopes also present in distantly related cpn60 protein homologs that are preserved during fixation procedures of the cells.",1995,"C S Martin, A I Flores, J M Cuezva, C S Martin, A I Flores, J M Cuezva"

Transposition of I factors can be experimentally induced: they are stable in inducer strains, but transpose at high frequency in the germline of females, known as SF females, produced by crossing reactive females and inducer males. We have constructed an I element, called IviP2, marked with the vermilion gene, the coding sequence of which was interrupted by an intron. Splicing of the intron can only occur in the transcript initiated from the I element promoter. Transposed copies expressing a wild-type vermilion phenotype were recovered in the germline of SF females in which I factors were actively transposing. This indicates that trans-complementation of a defective I element, deficient for the second open reading frame, by functional I factors can occur in the germline of dysgenic females.",1995,"M C Chaboissier, C Bornecque, I Busseau, A Bucheton, M C Chaboissier, C Bornecque, I Busseau, A Bucheton"
Molecular characterization of the zerknüllt region of the Antennapedia complex of D. subobscura,7587584,10.1007/BF00357688,"We have characterized at the molecular level the zerknüllt (zen) region of the Drosophila subobscura Antennapedia complex. The sequence comparison between D. subobscura and D. melanogaster shows an irregular distribution of the conserved and diverged regions, with the homeobox and a putative activating domain completely conserved. Comparisons of the promoter sequence and pattern of expression of the gene during development suggest that the regulation of zen has been conserved during evolution. The conservation of zen expression in a subpopulation of the polar cells indicates the existence of an important role in such cells. We describe a transitory segmented pattern of expression of zen in both species, suggesting the existence of interactions with a pair rule gene. Some indirect clues indicate that the z2 gene might be absent from the D. subobscura genome. A chromosome walk initiated to reach the proboscipedia gene of D. subobscura reveals that the distance between pb and zen is at least four times the one described for D. melanogaster and for D. pseudoobscura. Finally, we present cytological evidence showing that the ANT-C is inverted in D. subobscura as compared to D. melanogaster.",1995,"J Terol, M Perez-Alonso, R de Frutos, J Terol, M Perez-Alonso, R de Frutos"
Selection for increased longevity in Drosophila melanogaster: a reply to Lints,7744269,10.1159/000213665,"An important tool in the genetic analysis of longevity and aging in Drosophila melanogaster is the use of strains selected directly for late-age reproduction and indirectly for extended longevity. Following some initial failures to select for extended longevity, there are now a number of laboratories which have successfully selected for long life, using the techniques of late-age reproduction as well as selection for stress resistance. Baret and Lints [Gerontology 1993;39:252-259] have recently cast doubt on the reality of a number of these selected strains, including our own, suggesting that the difference in longevity between the long-lived and normal-lived strains disappears when the data are examined as a function of the number of days after the beginning of the selection experiment instead of as a function of the number of generations. With regard to our selected lines, they based their analysis on a subset of the published data dealing with these strains, and which covered 21 generations, or 40 months, of selection. We now present data for over 70 generations, or 155 months, of selection and maintenance. The Baret-Lints hypothesis makes two strong predictions, namely that (1) the longevity difference between the several strains should disappear when the data are replotted according to their fashion, and (2) there should be no other significant biological difference between the strains. Our data falsifies both of these predictions. The Baret-Lints hypothesis is flawed and should be disregarded.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,"R Arking, S Buck, R Arking, S Buck"

The PLC beta 4 gene is expressed at high abundance in cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurones of the substantia nigra, the median geniculate bodies and the thalamic nuclei. PLC beta 4 transcripts are also detected in the mammillary nuclei, the neocortex, the habenula and the olfactory bulbs. The specific pattern of gene expression we have observed should help to clarify the relationships between the PLC beta 4 and various constituents of second-messenger systems involved in transduction mechanisms triggered by the stimulation of seven transmembrane domain receptors.

The tolkin gene is a tolloid/BMP-1 homologue that is essential for Drosophila development,8536976,,"The Drosophila decapentaplegic (dpp) gene, a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of growth factors, is critical for specification of the embryonic dorsal-ventral axis, for proper formation of the midgut, and for formation of Drosophila adult structures. The Drosophila tolloid gene has been shown to genetically interact with dpp. The genetic interactions between tolloid and dpp suggests a model in which the tolloid protein participates in a complex containing the DPP ligand, its protease serving to activate DPP, either directly or indirectly. We report here the identification and cloning of another Drosophila member of the tolloid/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 1 family, tolkin, which is located 700 bp 5' to tolloid. Its overall structure is like tolloid, with an N-terminal metalloprotease domain, five complement subcomponents C1r/C1s, Uegf, and Bmp1 (CUB) repeats and two epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats. Its expression pattern overlaps that of tolloid and dpp in early embryos and diverges in later stages. In larval tissues, both tolloid and tolkin are expressed uniformly in the imaginal disks. In the brain, both tolloid and tolkin are expressed in the outer proliferation center, whereas tolkin has another stripe of expression near the outer proliferation center. Analysis of lethal mutations in tolkin indicate it is vital during larval and pupal stages. Analysis of its mutant phenotypes and expression patterns suggests that its functions may be mostly independent of tolloid and dpp.",1995,"A L Finelli, T Xie, C A Bossie, R K Blackman, R W Padgett, A L Finelli, T Xie, C A Bossie, R K Blackman, R W Padgett"
cAMP-dependent protein kinase and hedgehog act antagonistically in regulating decapentaplegic transcription in Drosophila imaginal discs,7867062,10.1016/0092-8674(95)90508-1,"Localized expression of decapentaplegic (dpp) is required for proper development of the Drosophila imaginal discs. Using genetic mosaics, we show that in the anterior compartment of appendage discs and anterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc, cells that lack cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity ectopically express dpp. Pka- cells can influence the fate of neighboring cells to reorganize anterior patterns in appendages and trigger ectopic morphogenetic furrows in the developing retina. This organizing activity of Pka mutant cells depends on dpp activity. Our findings suggest that PKA is a component of a signaling pathway that represses dpp expression and that hh antagonizes this pathway to maintain dpp expression at the anterior-posterior compartment border and in the morphogenetic furrow.",1995,"D Pan, G M Rubin, D Pan, G M Rubin"

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MVP1 gene interacts with VPS1 and is required for vacuolar protein sorting,7862158,10.1128/mcb.15.3.1671,"The VPS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an 80-kDa GTPase that associates with Golgi membranes and is required for the sorting of proteins to the yeast vacuole. Vps1p is a member of a growing family of high-molecular-weight GTPases that are found in a number of organisms and are involved in a variety of cellular processes. Vps1p is most similar to mammalian dynamin and the Drosophila Shibire protein, both of which have been shown to play a role in an early step of endocytosis. To identify proteins that interact with Vps1p, a genetic screen was designed to isolate multicopy suppressors of dominant-negative vps1 mutations. One such suppressor, MVP1, that exhibits genetic interaction with VPS1 and is itself required for vacuolar protein sorting has been isolated. Overproduction of Mvp1p will suppress several dominant alleles of VPS1, and suppression is dependent on the presence of wild-type Vps1p. MVP1 encodes a 59-kDa hydrophilic protein, Mvp1p, which appears to colocalize with Vps1p in vps1d and vps27 delta yeast cells. We therefore propose that Mvp1p and Vps1p act in concert to promote membrane traffic to the vacuole.",1995,"K Ekena, T H Stevens, K Ekena, T H Stevens"
Molecular characterization of spontaneous mutations at the scarlet locus of Drosophila melanogaster,8544833,10.1007/BF00418037,"Six spontaneous mutations of the scarlet (st) locus of Drosophila melanogaster have been studied at the molecular level. Two of the mutants (st1 and stsp) arose in laboratory populations, while the other four (stcob, stct89, stdct and stdv) were isolated from natural populations. In five of these there is a DNA insertion within the st region and in four cases the insertion has been identified as being a transposable element; these include the retrotransposons 412 and B104/roo, and also jockey a member of the LINE family. In the other case (stdct), the insertion appears to consist of partially duplicated st sequences. In two of the mutants (st1 and stdv) the same transposable element (412) has inserted in the same orientation at exactly the same site within the st gene. The transposable element insertions are found in intron and exon regions of the st gene and also in the putative upstream regulatory region; insertions located in introns or exons result in the production of truncated st transcripts. The results show that the same types of transposable elements that cause spontaneous mutation in laboratory stocks of D. melanogaster also cause mutation in the wild.",1995,"J F ten Have, M M Green, A J Howells, J F ten Have, M M Green, A J Howells"

We show that loss-of-function as well as insertional mutants in mvl display defects in taste behaviour with no alterations in the physiology of the sensory neurons. Activity of the reporter enzyme beta-galactosidase, that reflects the expression pattern of mvl, is seen in mature sensory neurons and in macrophages. The conceptual translation of the mvl cDNA shows a striking similarity (65% identity) with human NRAMP with almost complete identity in a conserved consensus motif found in a number of ATP-coupled transporters.

Drosophila glutamate receptor RNA expression in embryonic and larval muscle fibers,8589428,10.1002/aja.1002030303,"Glutamate is the excitatory transmitter at neuromuscular synapses in Drosophila, and electrophysiological studies indicate that the receptors for glutamate are concentrated in muscle fibers at synaptic sites. Acetylcholine is the excitatory transmitter at vertebrate neuromuscular synapses, and previous studies have shown that accumulation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at synaptic sites is controlled both by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. The transcriptional pathway culminates in selective expression of AChR subunit genes in nuclei near the synaptic site, causing AChR mRNA to accumulate in the synaptic region of the muscle fiber. We used a cDNA encoding a subunit of the Drosophila muscle glutamate receptor (DGluR-II) to determine the temporal and spatial expression pattern of the DGluR-II gene during embryogenesis and in larval muscle. We show that DGluR-II mRNA is first expressed at stage 12 of embryogenesis and that expression is detected in developing dorsal, lateral, and ventral somatic muscles within the next 2 hr. By stage 16 DGluR-II mRNA is expressed in all somatic muscles and in pharyngeal muscles. In third instar larvae DGluR-II mRNA is expressed in all body-wall muscle fibers. DGluR-II mRNA, however, is expressed throughout the larval muscle fibers and is not concentrated within muscle fibers at neuromuscular synapses.

Serrate expression can functionally replace Delta activity during neuroblast segregation in the Drosophila embryo,7720588,,Serrate and Delta encode structurally related proteins in D. melanogaster that bind within a common extracellular region on the NOTCH receptor molecule. We used ectopic expression to determine if SERRATE could mediate in vivo functions parallel or antagonistic to those proposed for the putative NOTCH ligand DELTA. Our results demonstrate that Serrate can replace Delta gene function during embryonic neuroblast segregation and that expression of Serrate leads to a NOTCH-dependent suppression of achaete expression in proneural clusters. Our findings strongly suggest that SERRATE functions as an alternative ligand capable of NOTCH activation.,1995,"Y Gu, N A Hukriede, R J Fleming, Y Gu, N A Hukriede, R J Fleming"
Linear dose-response relationship and no inverse dose-rate effect observed for low X-ray dose-induced mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster,7897279,10.1080/09553009514550361,"Mitotic recombination has emerged lately as a surprisingly common cause of recessive functional gene loss in mammalian cells and has been implicated in tumour suppressor gene loss in human neoplasms. In an assay, primarily monitoring mitotic recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, the ability of low dose acute- and chronic X-ray irradiation to induce clonal expression of recessive mutations of formally heterozygous loci was investigated. Mosaic spots of recessive wing-hair misshape mutations (mwh and flr) and of hair-into-bristles transforming mutation (zw3tic) were enhanced by a factor of two over control level following irradiation of heterozygous larvae to doses as low as 0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 Gy X-rays. The frequencies of mosaic spots induced with eight doses in the interval 0.01-2.0 Gy was linearly related to the dose. The regression lines show no significant intercept at zero dose. During the entire larval developmental period exposure of the exponentially growing target cell population to conditions of chronic irradiation at dose-rate of 15.7 x 10(-5) Gy/min provided no evidence of an inverse dose-rate effect as reported in yeast. In Drosophila, the probability of mitotic recombination per induced DNA double-strand break appears to be at least one order of magnitude higher than in man.",1995,"P M Schweizer, P M Schweizer"

Recent genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and mouse have provided important insights about synaptotagmin's role in neurotransmitter release. These experiments, combined with electrophysiological and biochemical studies, suggest that synaptotagmin is a key Ca2+ sensor, converting the ubiquitously used cellular secretory pathway into a Ca(2+)-regulated exocytotic pathway.",1995,"J T Littleton, H J Bellen, J T Littleton, H J Bellen"
The Xenopus homologue of Otx2 is a maternal homeobox gene that demarcates and specifies anterior body regions,7720578,,"In this paper we study Xotx2, a Xenopus homeobox gene related to orthodenticle, a gene expressed in the developing head of Drosophila. The murine cognate, Otx2, is first expressed in the entire epiblast of prestreak embryos and later in very anterior regions of late-gastrulae, including the neuroectoderm of presumptive fore- and mid-brain. In Xenopus, RNase protection experiments reveal that Xotx2 is expressed at low levels throughout early development from unfertilized egg to late blastula, when its expression level significantly increases. Whole-mount in situ hybridization shows a localized expression in the dorsal region of the marginal zone at stage 9.5. At stage 10.25 Xotx2 is expressed in dorsal bottle cells and in cells of the dorsal deep zone fated to give rise to prechordal mesendoderm, suggesting a role in the specification of very anterior structures. In stage 10.5 gastrulae, Xotx2 transcripts start to be detectable also in presumptive anterior neuroectoderm, where they persist in subsequent stages. Various treatments of early embryos cause a general reorganization of Xotx2 expression. In particular, retinoic acid treatment essentially abolishes Xotx2 expression in neuroectoderm. Microinjection of Xotx2 mRNA in 1-, 2- and 4-cell stage embryos causes the appearance of secondary cement glands and partial secondary axes in embryos with reduced trunk and tail structures. The presence of the Xotx2 homeodomain is required to produce these effects. In particular, this homeodomain contains a specific lysine residue at position 9 of the recognition helix. Microinjected transcripts of Xotx2 constructs containing a homeodomain where this lysine is substituted by a glutamine or a glutamic acid residue fail to cause these effects.",1995,"M Pannese, C Polo, M Andreazzoli, R Vignali, B Kablar, G Barsacchi, E Boncinelli, M Pannese, C Polo, M Andreazzoli, R Vignali, B Kablar, G Barsacchi, E Boncinelli"

Distance and pairing effects on the brownDominant heterochromatic element in Drosophila,7672573,,"We examined the behavior of the brownDominant (bwD) heterochromatic insertion moved to different locations relative to centric heterochromatin. Effects were measured as the degree of silencing of a wild-type brown eye pigment gene by bwD across a tandem duplication. A series of X-ray-induced effects were recovered at high frequency. Cis-acting enhancers were obtained by relocation of the duplication closer to autosomal heterochromatin. Enhancers were also recovered on the homologous chromosome when it was similarly rearranged, revealing a novel interhomologue effect whereby interactions occur between genetic elements near opposite ends of a chromosome arm rather than between paired alleles. Cis-acting suppressors were obtained as secondary rearrangements in which the duplication was moved farther away from heterochromatin. Suppression was correlated with loss of cytological association between bwD and the polytene chromocenter. Surprisingly, the distance from bwD to the chromocenter was not correlated with the strength of enhancement or suppression. We propose that bwD fails to coalesce with the chromocenter when its position along the chromosome places it beyond a threshold distance from heterochromatin, and this threshold depends upon the configuration of both the chromosome carrying bwD and its paired homologue.",1995,"S Henikoff, J M Jackson, P B Talbert, S Henikoff, J M Jackson, P B Talbert"
Inserting the Ftz homeodomain into engrailed creates a dominant transcriptional repressor that specifically turns off Ftz target genes in vivo,7600995,,"The Engrailed homeodomain protein is an 'active' or dominant transcriptional repressor in cultured cells. In contrast, the Fushi Tarazu homeodomain protein is an activator, both in cultured cells and in Drosophila embryos, where it activates several known target genes, including its own gene. This auto-activation has been shown to depend on targeting to a fushi tarazu enhancer by the Fushi Tarazu homeodomain. We combined Fushi Tarazu targeting and Engrailed active repression in a chimeric regulator, EFE. When EFE is ubiquitously expressed, it overrides endogenous Fushi Tarazu and causes a fushi tarazu mutant phenotype. Normal Fushi Tarazu target genes are affected as they are in fushi tarazu mutants. One such target gene is repressed by EFE even where Fushi Tarazu is not expressed, suggesting that the repression is active. This is confirmed by showing that the in vivo activity of EFE depends on a domain that is required for active repression in culture. A derivative that lacks this domain, while it cannot repress the endogenous fushi tarazu gene, can still reduce the activity of the fushi tarazu autoregulatory enhancer, suggesting that it competes with endogenous Fushi Tarazu for binding sites in vivo. However, this passive repression is much less effective than active repression.",1995,"A John, S T Smith, J B Jaynes, A John, S T Smith, J B Jaynes"

An inverse PCR screen for the detection of P element insertions in cloned genomic intervals in Drosophila melanogaster,7713430,,"We developed a screening approach that utilizes an inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach in a large scale genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new autosomal locations. Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16,100 insert bearing individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein-2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ""local"" P element transposition events.

Immunoprecipitation with ADL84 demonstrated that purified Drosophila nuclear lamins Dm1 and Dm2 are present as a random mixture of homo- and heterodimers. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments suggest that lamin Dm1 is present in all Drosophila cell types. The epitope for ADL84 was mapped by analyzing binding to bacterially expressed lamin deletion mutants and subsequently by screening for point mutants (randomly generated by polymerase chain reaction) which were not recognized by ADL84. The ADL84-epitope encompasses amino acids R22PPSAGP (arginine 22-proline 28). Peptide competition experiments demonstrated directly that phosphorylation of serine 25 impedes lamin binding by ADL84. This suggests that serine 25 is the lamin Dm2-specific phosphorylation site.",1995,"N Stuurman, N Maus, P A Fisher, N Stuurman, N Maus, P A Fisher"
Evidence for an effect of exposure to low levels of alpha particle irradiation in larval cells of Drosophila as measured in the wing-spot test,8692200,10.1016/0027-5107(96)00038-3,"Larvae of Drosophila were exposed to a range of concentrations of alpha particles from 3 to 318 mRad, and genetic effects measured in the wing-spot test.

Molecular clock or erratic evolution? A tale of two genes,8876205,10.1073/pnas.93.21.11729,"We have investigated the evolution of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh). The rate of amino acid replacements is 1 x 10(-10)/site/year when Drosophila species are compared. The rate is 2.7 times greater when Drosophila and Chymomyza species are compared; and about 5 times greater when any of those species are compared with the medfly Ceratitis capitata. This rate of 5 x 10(-10)/site/year is also the rate observed in comparisons between mammals, or between different animal phyla, or between the three multicellular kingdoms. We have also studied the evolution of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod). The rate of amino acid replacements is about 17 x 10(-10)/site/year when comparisons are made between dipterans or between mammals, but only 5 x 10(-10) when animal phyla are compared, and only 3 x 10(-10) when the multicellular kingdoms are compared. The apparent decrease by about a factor of 5 in the rate of SOD evolution as the divergence between species increases can be consistent with the molecular clock hypothesis by assuming the covarion hypothesis (namely, that the number of amino acids that can change is constant, but the set of such amino acids changes from time to time and from lineage to lineage). However, we know of no model consistent with the molecular clock hypothesis that would account for the increase in the rate of GPDH evolution as the divergence between species increases.",1996,"F J Ayala, E Barrio, J Kwiatowski, F J Ayala, E Barrio, J Kwiatowski"
"Molecular evolution between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans: reduced codon bias, faster rates of amino acid substitution, and larger proteins in D. melanogaster",8913769,,"Both natural selection and mutational biases contribute to variation in codon usage bias within Drosophila species. This study addresses the cause of codon bias differences between the sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Under a model of mutation-selection-drift, variation in mutational processes between species predicts greater base composition differences in neutrally evolving regions than in highly biased genes. Variation in selection intensity, however, predicts larger base composition differences in highly biased loci. Greater differences in the G+C content of 34 coding regions than 46 intron sequences between D. melanogaster and D. simulans suggest that D. melanogaster has undergone a reduction in selection intensity for codon bias. Computer simulations suggest at least a fivefold reduction in Nes at silent sites in this lineage. Other classes of molecular change show lineage effects between these species. Rates of amino acid substitution are higher in the D. melanogaster lineage than in D. simulans in 14 genes for which outgroup sequences are available. Surprisingly, protein sizes are larger in D. melanogaster than in D. simulans in the 34 genes compared between the two species. A substantial fraction of silent, replacement, and insertion/deletion mutations in coding regions may be weakly selected in Drosophila.",1996,"H Akashi, H Akashi"

A single 6.2 kb message for the EcR gene was abundant in wing discs and fat bodies at the onset of metamorphosis. At the same stage, however, no or a tiny amount of mRNA was shown in posterior or middle silk glands, respectively. During the final instar, the mRNA expression in wing discs was maximal on the day of wandering.

Large genetic change at small fitness cost in large populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for wind tunnel flight: rethinking fitness surfaces,8878686,,"The fitness effects of extreme genetic change by selection were studied in large populations subjected to prolonged, intense selection. Two replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster, with estimated effective sizes 500 < or = Ne < or = 1000, were selected for increased performance in a wind tunnel, selecting on average the fastest 4.5% of flies. The mean apparent flying speed of both lines increased from approximately 2 to 170 cm/sec and continued to respond at diminishing rates, without reaching a plateau, for 100 generations. Competitive fitness tests in generations 50 and 85 showed minimal or no fitness loss in selected lines compared to controls. Sublines relaxed in generations 65 and 85 showed minimal or no regression in apparent flying speed. Hybrid lines, from a cross of selected x control lines in generation 75, responded to reselection saltationally, showing that the chromosomes of the selected lines had been assembled from alleles at many loci, from many different chromosomes in the base population. Thus, major genetic change was achieved, but without the costs usually associated with strong directional selection. Large population size has been interpreted, in opposing models, as either a brake or an accelerator in its effects on long-term change by selection. These results favor the second model, and challenge the concept of rugged fitness surfaces underlying the first model.",1996,"K E Weber, K E Weber"
High density of an SAR-associated motif differentiates heterochromatin from euchromatin,8977875,10.1006/jtbi.1996.0209,"Heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic chromosomes, comprising a significant portion of the total DNA in genomes. Despite its prevalence, long-standing cytological descriptions, and predominant composition of tandemly repeated DNA, no general theory unites heterochromatic with its functions. In an attempt to identify heterochromatic sequence tags, we have analysed heterochromatic sequences from Drosophila melanogaster for the presence of motifs that are known to define regions that anchor the chromosomal DNA to the scaffold (scaffold attachment regions or SARs). The SARs of Drosophila melanogaster are characterized by the presence of a small conserved sequence (the A-box) that is clustered in overall A + T-rich regions. In comparing heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences we find that heterochromatic regions are several-fold enriched for these operationally defined SARs. This high density of SAR-associated sequences not only serves as a molecular tag for heterochromatin but also suggests a hypothesis for its special properties.",1996,"L D Strausbaugh, S M Williams, L D Strausbaugh, S M Williams"
Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine synthetase [corrected] suppress position-effect variegation,8725236,,"In Drosophila melanogaster, the study of trans-acting modifier mutations of position-effect variegation and Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes have been useful tools to investigate genes involved in chromatin structure. We have cloned a modifier gene, Suppressor of zeste 5 (Su(z)5), which encodes S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, and we present here molecular results and data concerning its expression in mutants and genetic interactions. The mutant alleles Su(z)5, l(2)R23 and l(2)M6 show suppression of wm4 and also of two white mutants induced by roo element insertions in the regulatory region i.e., wis (in combination with z1) and wsp1. Two of the Su(z)5 alleles, as well as a deletion of the gene, also act as enhancers of Polycomb by increasing the size of sex combs on midleg. The results suggest that Su(z)5 is connected with regulation of chromatin structure. The enzyme S-adenosylmethionine synthetase is involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl group donor and also, after decarboxylation, a propylamino group donor in the bio-synthesis of polyamines. Our results from HPLC analysis show that in ovaries from heterozygous Su(z)5 mutants the content of spermine is significantly reduced. Results presented here suggest that polyamines are an important molecule class in the regulation of chromatin structure.",1996,"J Larsson, J Zhang, A Rasmuson-Lestander, J Larsson, J Zhang, A Rasmuson-Lestander"
Chromatin and gene regulation at the onset of embryonic development,9021871,,"Major transitions in chromosome and chromatin structure occur during development. Recent genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrate that these alterations in genome organization make significant contributions to establishing and maintaining states of differential transcriptional activity. Developmentally regulated changes in histone variants have a causal role in determining patterns of gene activity, directing the repression of specific eukaryotic genes. Chromosomal proteins such as Polycomb stabilize and maintain transcriptionally repressed states. Proteins regulating mitotic chromosome condensation have a role in determining the overall transcriptional activity of a chromosome. In this review, I place the developmental roles of these chromosomal constituents in a structural and functional context. Considerable insight now exists into the molecular mechanisms regulating chromosomal activity during development. Chromosomal architecture is emerging as a key controlling influence in the developmental regulation of gene expression. Recent genetic experiments using Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse have provided clear evidence for the functional differentiation of chromosomal structures during development. Chromosomes are visualized as highly specialized entities, within which the activity of particular domains is largely determined by defined structural proteins. At a more local level, the mechanisms regulating gene transcription during early embryogenesis in Xenopus and the mouse have been found to be dependent on the biochemical composition of individual nucleosomes. Thus, variation in the type and modification of chromosomal and chromatin structural proteins provides a dominant means of controlling the transcriptional activity of individual genes, individual chromosomal domains and of entire chromosomes. The focus of this review is to summarize these recent advances and to discuss their implications for developmental biology.",1996,"A P Wolffe, A P Wolffe"
"daughterless is required for Drosophila photoreceptor cell determination, eye morphogenesis, and cell cycle progression",8873754,10.1006/dbio.1996.0241,"Initiation of Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS) development requires the achaete-scute complex (AS-C) and the atonal (ato) genes.

Here, we examine the expression and function of da within the developing Drosophila eye. The use of a monoclonal antibody to the Da protein revealed that Da levels are modulated across the developing eye disc. Within the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and photoreceptor cell R8, there is a cell-by-cell correspondence between high levels of Da protein expression and Ato protein expression. Mosaic analysis of adult tissue demonstrates that da function is cell autonomous and required within R2, R3, R4, R5, and R8. Examination of gene expression in da- imaginal disc clones reveals that da regulates Ato expression in the MF, affects the progression of the MF, and is necessary for the reestablishment of the G2 and M phases of the synchronized cell cycle posterior to the MF.",1996,"N L Brown, S W Paddock, C A Sattler, C Cronmiller, B J Thomas, S B Carroll, N L Brown, S W Paddock, C A Sattler, C Cronmiller, B J Thomas, S B Carroll"
ERp60 does not substitute for protein disulphide isomerase as the beta-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase,8687406,10.1042/bj3160599,"Prolyl 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.2) catalyses the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens.

We report here on the cloning and expression of the human and Drosophila ERp60 polypeptides. The overall amino acid sequence identity and similarity between the processed human ERp60 and PDI polypeptides are 29% and 56% respectively, and those between the Drosophila ERp60 and human PDI polypeptides 29% and 55%. The two ERp60 polypeptides were found to be similar to human PDI within almost all their domains, the only exception being the extreme C-terminal region. Nevertheless, when the human or Drosophila ERp60 was expressed in insect cells together with an alpha-subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase, no tetramer was formed and no prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity was generated in the cells.

We have conducted a detailed phenotypic analysis of csw mutations to identify these additional functions of Csw. Our results indicate that Csw operates positively downstream of other Drosophila RTKs such as the Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (DER), the fibroblast growth factor receptor (Breathless), and likely other RTKs. This model is substantiated by specific dosage interactions between csw and DER. It is proposed that Csw is part of the evolutionarily conserved ""signaling cassette"" that operates downstream of all RTKs. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that SHP-2, a vertebrate PTPase similar to Csw and previously implicated in RTK signaling, encodes the functional vertebrate homologue of Csw.",1996,"L A Perkins, M R Johnson, M B Melnick, N Perrimon, L A Perkins, M R Johnson, M B Melnick, N Perrimon"

Molecular structure of rare but geographically widespread sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 'ultra-fast' electrophoretic alleles in Drosophila melanogaster,8901136,10.1007/BF00054623,"Six naturally occurring but rare alleles of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpdh) in Drosophila melanogaster have been investigated in this study. They all belong to a class of GpdhUF (ultra-fast) alleles, because their electrophoretic mobilities are faster than that of the GpdhF (fast) allele. The GpdhUF variants are widespread, and have been reported from five continents. DNA sequence analysis has shown that the change in electrophoretic mobility was in each allele caused by a single amino acid residue substitution in the encoded protein. In the XiamenUF allele it is a substitution of lysine (AAA) to asparagine (AAT) in exon 1 (residue 3). An asparagine (AAT) to aspartate (GAT) change was found in exon 6 (residue 336) in the IowaUF and NetherlandsUF alleles. The mobility of the RaleighUF allele was altered by a valine (GTG) to glutamate (GAG) substitution in exon 3 (residue 76). Two mutations were detected in the BrazzavilleUF allele: a lysine (AAG) to methionine (ATG) substitution in exon 2 (residue 68) is responsible for the ultra-fast phenotype of this variant, while a tyrosine (TAT) to phenylalanine (TTT) substitution in exon 4 (residue 244) is not expected to alter the electrophoretic mobility of the encoded protein. These results indicate that the GpdhUF alleles originate from different mutational events, and only two of them--IowaUF and NetherlandsUF--might share a common ancestry. The GPDH activity of the IowaUF allele is intermediate between those of the GpdhS and GpdhF control stocks. The other GpdhUF variants have lower activities than the controls: XiamenUF--83%, RaleighUF--80% and BrazzavilleUF--73% of the GpdhF control.",1996,"T M Wilanowski, P T Barnes, J B Gibson, T M Wilanowski, P T Barnes, J B Gibson"

The Mad (Mothers against decapentaplegic) gene from Drosophila and the related Sma genes from Caenorhabditis elegans have been genetically implicated in signalling by members of the bone-morphogenetic-protein (BMP) subfamily. We have cloned Smad1, a human homologue of Mad and Sma. Microinjection of Smad1 messenger RNA into Xenopus embryo animal caps mimics the mesoderm-ventralizing effects of BMP4. Smad1 moves into the nucleus in response to BMP4. Smad1 has transcriptional activity when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain, and this activity is increased by BMP4 acting through BMP-receptor types I and II. The transactivating activity resides in the conserved carboxy-terminal domain of Smad1 and is disrupted by a nonsense mutation that corresponds to null mutations found in Mad and in the related gene DPC4, a candidate tumour-suppressor gene in human pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we show that DPC4 contains a transcriptional activation domain. The results suggests that the Smad proteins are a new class of transcription factors that mediate responses to the TGF-beta family.",1996,"F Liu, A Hata, J C Baker, J Doody, J Cárcamo, R M Harland, J Massagué, F Liu, A Hata, J C Baker, J Doody, J Cárcamo, R M Harland, J Massagué"

Time-dependent responses to glp-1-mediated inductions in early C. elegans embryos,8681785,,"In an embryo of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two blastomeres at the 4-cell stage, ABa and ABp, are born with equivalent developmental potential. Subsequently, interactions with the P2 blastomere at the 4-cell stage and the MS blastomere at the 12-cell stage generate differences in developmental fate among descendants of ABa and ABp. We have reproduced these inductions in vitro using embryonic blastomeres isolated in cell-culture medium. We show that during these inductions only the responding AB descendants require the activity of the glp-1 gene, which is similar in sequence to Drosophila Notch, supporting models in which GLP-1 protein acts as a receptor for both the P2 and MS signals. We also show that P2 signaling requires the activity of the apx-1 gene, similar in sequence to Drosophila Delta, and that MS signaling requires the putative transcription factor SKN-1. We present evidence that the primary factor determining the different responses to these two signals is the age of the AB descendants, not the identity of the signaling cell or ligand. Therefore, we suggest that time-dependent changes in factors within AB descendants are responsible for their different responses to inductive signals that use a common receptor.",1996,"C A Shelton, B Bowerman, C A Shelton, B Bowerman"

Aging mechanisms in fruit files,8885717,10.1002/bies.950181006,"Genetic analysis of Drosophila has provided evidence in support of two proposed evolutionary genetic mechanisms of aging: mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy.

Analyses of large numbers of files have revealed that mortality rates do not continue to rise with age as previously thought, but plateau at advanced ages. This phenomenon has implications both for models and for definitions of aging, and may be explained by the evolutionary theories. The physiological processes and genes most relevant to aging are being identified using Drosophila lines selected in the laboratory for postponed senescence. Oxidative stress and insufficient metabolic reserves/capacity may be particularly important factors in limiting the fruitfly lifespan.

In situ hybridization using a nonradioactive cRNA probe identified a large number of cell bodies expressing ChAT mRNA in the cortices of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster brain. Strong labeling is remarkable in the cortical regions associated with the lamina and antennal lobe, and also in the median neurosecretory (MNS) cells within pars intercerebralis, suggesting that some of the lamina monopolar neurons, antennal interneurons, and MNS cells are cholinergic. In two temperature-sensitive mutant alleles, Chats1 and Chats2, most hybridization signal disappears after exposure to a restrictive temperature (30 degrees C). Loss of signal is especially evident in the optic lobes. Some centrally located neurons, however, continue to express ChAT mRNA and are thus likely to have expression controlled in a different way than the majority of cholinergic neurons. Immunocytochemistry, using a ChAT specific monoclonal antibody, identified two sets of paired neurons located in the posterior cortex of the brain. These neurons persist in ChAT immunoreactivity even in the Chats mutants exposed to restrictive temperature.

Distribution of topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage sites and relation to structural and functional landmarks in 830 kb of Drosophila DNA,9153300,10.1093/nar/25.11.2041,"The pattern of sites for cleavage mediated by topoisomerase II was determined in 830 kb of cloned DNA from the Drosophila X chromosome, with the objectives of comparing it with mapped structural and functional landmarks and examining if the correlations with such landmarks reported in individual loci can be generalized to a region approximately 100 times longer. The relative frequencies of topoisomerase II cleavage sites in 247 restriction fragments from 67 clones were quantified by hybridization with probes prepared from DNA fragments which abutted all cleavage sites in each clone, selected through the covalently bound topoisomerase II subunit; the specificity and quantitative nature of this method were demonstrated using a plasmid DNA model. The 12 restriction fragments with strong nuclear scaffold attachment (SAR) activity, of which seven possess autonomous replication (ARS) activity, show statistically strong coincidence or contiguity ( P </=0.11) with regions of high topoisomerase II cleavage site frequency. These regions show no correlation with repetitive sequence or A/T or C/G content and some extend over >10 kb; their sensitivity is therefore unlikely to be due to alternating purine-pyrimidine repeats or regions of Z conformation, which are preferred motifs. The hypothesis that they possess intrinsic curvature is consistent with the similarity of their length and spacing to regions of predicted curvature in the 315 kb DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III and with the reported strong binding preference of topoisomerase II for curved DNA. The topoisomerase II cleavage pattern in this DNA further shows that its relationships to functional properties seen in individual loci, especially to MAR/SAR and ARS activity and to the restricted accessibility of DNA to topoisomerase II in vivo, can be generalized to much longer regions of the genome.",1997,"R Miassod, S V Razin, R Hancock, R Miassod, S V Razin, R Hancock"

Drosophila laminin binds to mammalian nidogen and to heparan sulfate proteoglycan,9183014,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-1-00745.x,"A Drosophila laminin that has the chain composition alpha5 beta1 gamma1, relative to mammalian laminins, bound human and mouse nidogen almost as strongly as mouse laminin-1 (alpha1 beta1 gamma1) in solid-phase assays, and had only a fourfold lower affinity in a radioligand competition test. This is due to a short, highly conserved sequence that occurs in both laminin gamma1 chains and which binds nidogen. When the single conservative amino acid difference between the two sequences (Tyr-->His) was introduced into the mouse laminin binding module gamma1 III4 it failed to cause any change of binding. A high affinity between Drosophila laminin and mouse nidogen resulted in the formation of a stable complex in solution. Drosophila laminin also bound to the mouse heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan and the formation of this complex was inhibited by heparin, but not by chondroitin sulfate. In addition, a weaker connection between the core protein of mouse perlecan and Drosophila laminin can be mediated through nidogen. Elastase and other proteases degraded Drosophila laminin to a restricted number of larger fragments (40-300 kDa), almost all of which were bound to a heparin affinity column. Three fragments could be displaced at low salt concentration and were derived from the short arms of the Drosophila laminin, as shown by sequence analysis. A more strongly bound 50-kDa fragment apparently comprised the globular domains LG2 and LG3 derived from the C-terminal part of its alpha chain.

Molecular organization of an individual Drosophila polytene chromomere: transcribed sequences in the 10A1-2 band,9439569,10.1007/s004380050623,"Complete cloning of the DNA in the cytogenetic region 9F12-10A7 has allowed us to analyze the fine structure of an individual polytene chromomere in Drosophila melanogaster. In this report we identify the transcriptionally active fragments within the 10A1-2 band. At least 22 DNA fragments representing multiple distinct transcription units are active during embryogenesis, in third-instar larva or in isolated larval tissues. The transcribed fragments are significantly (at least sevenfold) more numerous than the three genetically defined complementation groups in the 10A1-2 band.

Analysis of the structure and expression fo the TFIIB gene in Drosophila melanogaster,9264025,,"We have isolated and characterized a genomic clone encoding the Drosophila melanogaster transcription factor IIB (TFIIB). The coding region of the TFIIB gene is interrupted by three short introns. The 5'-flanking region of the gene lacks the typical TATA box sequence like those of other known genes encoding the general transcription factors. In addition, the 5'-flanking region of the gene contains several common DNA sequences present in Drosophila TBP and TFIIS genes, suggesting the common regulation mechanism of gene expression. RNA blot analysis revealed that the gene expresses 1.6 kb, 1.3 kb and 1.2 kb mRNAs throughout development and in adults. Deletion analysis of the promoter region shows that the minimal promoter necessary for efficient expression is located between -698 (PstI) and +60 relative to the transcription start point. Within this minimal promoter region, the upstream regulatory element responsible for the stimulation of gene expression may exist in the DNA fragment between -698 (PsfI) and -351 (StuI).",1997,"K S Lee, Y Oh, G Baek, J Yoon, K Han, N Cho, K Baek, K S Lee, Y Oh, G Baek, J Yoon, K Han, N Cho, K Baek"
[Disordered development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos mosaic for the Notch gene],9304093,,"Gene Notch codes for a transmembrane protein, which is involved in cell interactions: mutations in Notch locus result in differentiation of all cells of the ventral and anterodorsal ectoderm into neuroblasts. In order to examine interrelations between cells of the normal and mutant phenotype, mosaic embryos were obtained. Procephalic regions of Drosophila trunk were most strongly affected in the experimental, as well as in the control, embryos. In control mosaics, the absence of anterodorsal ectoderm was accompanied by a decrease in the size of epipharyngeal ganglion, whereas Notch mosaics, in contrast, showed the expansion of epipharyngeal ganglion over dorsal ectoderm up to the posterior end of the embryo. Differentiation abnormalities of cells of the ventral ectoderm in Notch mosaics were rarer. Generally, the results of our experiments lead to a hypothesis about the presence of a certain threshold in the proportion between Notch cells and wild-type cells in ventral ectoderm. When this threshold value is exceeded, all cells of ventral ectoderm differentiate into neuroblasts.",1997,"I P Frolova, A I Ivanov, I P Frolova, A I Ivanov"
A mammalian homologue of the Drosophila retinal degeneration B gene: implications for the evolution of phototransduction mechanisms,9680295,10.1046/j.1365-4624.1997.00015.x,"Comparative analysis of homologous genes in distantly related species provides important insights into the evolution of complex physiological processes. The Drosophila retinal degeneration B (rdgB) gene encodes a protein involved in phototransduction in the fly. We have isolated a human gene, DRES9, and its murine homologue (Dres9), which show a high degree of similarity to the Drosophila rdgB gene. RNA in situ hybridization studies performed on mouse-embryo tissue sections at various developmental stages revealed that Dres9 is expressed at very high levels in the neural retina and in the central nervous system (CNS), similar to its Drosophila counterpart. The high level of sequence conservation and similarities in the expression patterns of rdgB and DRES9 during development in Drosophila and mammals indicate that Dres9 is the orthologue of RdgB, and strongly suggest a possible functional conservation of these proteins during evolution. DRES9 encodes a phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol may have a role as an intracellular messenger in vertebrate phototransduction. The identification of this gene and the study of its expression pattern in mammals will help shed new light on the evolution of vision mechanisms and suggest DRES9 as a candidate gene for human retinopathies.",1997,"F Rubboli, A Bulfone, S Bogni, A Marchitiello, M Zollo, G Borsani, A Ballabio, S Banfi, F Rubboli, A Bulfone, S Bogni, A Marchitiello, M Zollo, G Borsani, A Ballabio, S Banfi"

Seven vertebrate Smad genes, which fall into three classes, have been reported. Members of the Class I Smads have been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic portion of the TGF-beta like receptors, where they become phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus they may function as transcriptional activators. We wondered if translocation to the nucleus is a general property of the Smads and whether it was evolutionarily conserved. We examined the subcellular localization of Drosophila MAD and found that it is capable of nuclear translocation, in Drosophila S2 cells, when the dpp pathway is stimulated. To prove the functional conservation of receptor/Smad interactions, we used the mouse BMP type I receptor ALK6 to stimulate the pathway and found that it is capable of sending MAD to the nucleus.

Proneural function of neurogenic genes in the developing Drosophila eye,9016706,10.1016/s0960-9822(06)00056-x,"Background:
        
      
      . Intercellular signals are major determinants of cell fate during development. Certain signals and receptors are important for many different cell-fate decisions, suggesting that cellular responses to similar signals change during development. Few transitions between such distinct cellular responses have been studied. The Drosophila genes Notch and hedgehog function during intracellular signaling at various stages of development. In the specific case of development of the Drosophila eye, expression of the proneural gene atonal is induced in response to Hedgehog signaling and then becomes subject to autoregulation. The receptor protein Notch has previously been reported to function in the selection of single founder photoreceptor cells (R8 cells) by inhibiting atonal expression. On this basis, complete elimination of Notch gene function would be expected to cause neural hyperplasia in the eye.
    


          Results:
        
      
      . Contrary to expectation, we detect a reduction in neural differentiation both in cells expressing a conditional Notch allele and in those lacking expression of either Notch or its ligand Delta. We show here that Notch signaling acts after the initial Hedgehog-driven expression of atonal to enhance proneural competence of the atonal-expressing cells and also to terminate their response to the Hedgehog signals. This occurs before the Notch-induced lateral inhibition of atonal expression within the same cells.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      . Notch has sequentially opposite effects on the same cells, by first promoting and then inhibiting proneural gene function. This apparently paradoxical sequence of events has two possible consequences. Firstly, coupling of alternative cellular responses to the same receptor may prevent them from occurring simultaneously. Secondly, consecutive regulatory processes become temporally coupled, so that these events follow on from each other, without gaps or overlaps.",1997,"N E Baker, S Y Yu, N E Baker, S Y Yu"
Cloning and sequencing of ribosomal protein L27a and a gene similar to human GS1 in Drosophila,9055824,10.1016/s0378-1119(96)00656-7,"Two closely linked genes were identified and characterized in the 24F region on the left arm of chromosome 2 in Drosophila.

The predicted amino-acid sequence of this protein is 47.2% identical to that of the previously reported human GS1 protein, which is encoded by a gene that is of interest because it is one of the few X-linked genes that escapes X-inactivation. We have accordingly named our gene GS1like (GS1l). The second cDNA begins 383 bp proximal to the first. This cDNA encodes a protein of a predicted 149 amino acids and a molecular mass of 17.0 kDa. This protein represents a homolog of ribosomal protein L27a; thus, we have named the gene RpL27a. This gene might be responsible for the Minute mutation located at 24F.

Binding of high-risk human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins to the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein,9326658,10.1073/pnas.94.21.11612,"In the majority of cervical cancers, DNAs of high-risk mucosotpropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs), such as type 16, are maintained so as to express two viral proteins, E6 and E7, suggesting an essential importance to carcinogenesis. The high-risk HPV E6 proteins are known to inactivate p53 tumor suppressor protein but appear to have an additional, molecularly unknown function(s). In this study, we demonstrate that these E6 proteins can bind to the second PDZ domain of the human homologue of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein (hDLG) through their C-terminal XS/TXV/L (where X represents any amino acid, S/T serine or threonine, and V/L valine or leucine) motif. This finding is similar to the interaction between the adenomatous polyposis coli gene product and hDLG. E6 mutants losing the ability to bind to hDLG are no longer able to induce E6-dependent transformation of rodent cells. These results suggest an intriguing possibility that interaction between the E6 protein and hDLG or other PDZ domain-containing proteins could be an underlying mechanism in the development of HPV-associated cancers.",1997,"T Kiyono, A Hiraiwa, M Fujita, Y Hayashi, T Akiyama, M Ishibashi, T Kiyono, A Hiraiwa, M Fujita, Y Hayashi, T Akiyama, M Ishibashi"

Like the RAD51 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Coprinus gene is highly induced by gamma irradiation and during meiosis.

Hsp70 expression varied more than twofold among lines after induction by exposure to 36°C for one hour, with an estimated proportion of the variation due to genetic differences of 0.24 ± 0.08. Thermotolerance with and without a Hsp70-inducing pretreatment, survival at 25°C, and developmental time also varied significantly. As expected, expression of Hsp70 correlated positively with larval thermotolerance. By contrast, lines in which larval survival was high in the absence of heat stress showed lower than average Hsp70 expression and lower than average inducible thermotolerance. This conditional performance suggests an evolutionary trade-off between thermotolerance and the ability to produce higher concentrations of Hsp70, and survival in a benign environment.",1997,"Robert A Krebs, Martin E Feder, Robert A Krebs, Martin E Feder"

Transgene repeat arrays interact with distant heterochromatin and cause silencing in cis and trans,9383061,,"Tandem repeats of Drosophila transgenes can cause heterochromatic variegation for transgene expression in a copy-number and orientation-dependent manner. Here, we demonstrate different ways in which these transgene repeat arrays interact with other sequences at a distance, displaying properties identical to those of a naturally occurring block of interstitial heterochromatin. Arrays consisting of tandemly repeated white transgenes are strongly affected by proximity to constitutive heterochromatin. Moving an array closer to heterochromatin enhanced variegation, and enhancement was reverted by recombination of the array onto a normal sequence chromosome. Rearrangements that lack the array enhanced variegation of white on a homologue bearing the array. Therefore, silencing of white genes within a repeat array depends on its distance from heterochromatin of the same chromosome or of its paired homologue. In addition, white transgene arrays cause variegation of a nearby gene in cis, a hallmark of classical position-effect variegation. Such spreading of heterochromatic silencing correlates with array size. Finally, white transgene arrays cause pairing-dependent silencing of a non-variegating white insertion at the homologous position.",1997,"D R Dorer, S Henikoff, D R Dorer, S Henikoff"
Modelling the activity of the Ultrabithorax parasegment-specific regulatory domains around their anterior boundaries,9278718,10.1006/jtbi.1996.0368,"The Drosophila Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene was one of the first homeotic genes to be characterised and it specifies the phenotypic characteristics of parasegments 5 and 6. The intricate pattern of Ubx expression in these parasegments is conferred by enormous regulatory regions which, together with the structural gene, constitute the Ubx domain. A genetic, ""open-for-business"", model based on classical mutational analysis proposed that the regulatory regions were in fact composite structures, consisting of parasegment-specific regulatory domains that contain arrays of cell-specific enhancers which drive the intricate pattern of Ubx expression. Here, we propose a molecular mechanism, based on a survey of numerous transgenic studies, of the setting up of these parasegment-specific regulatory domains in the appropriate parts of the late blastoderm embryo. We construct a mathematical model of this mechanism using the molecular characteristics of a single initiator element, the distributions of segmentation gene products and simple competitive binding equations. We attempt to fit this mathematical model to the idealised patterns of activity and closure of the parasegment-specific domains derived from the genetic model. The resulting fitted pattern of activity and closure obtained with the simplest version of our competitive binding model shows some deviations from the idealised pattern based on the genetic model. Comparison of the predictions with recent experimental evidence suggests that the competitive binding model more accurately reflects certain features of the Ubx expression pattern--features not predicted by the genetic model.",1997,"P B Singh, D Brown, P B Singh, D Brown"
Activation of distinct caspase-like proteases by Fas and reaper in Drosophila cells,9342343,10.1073/pnas.94.22.11951,"The cytoplasmic region of Fas, a mammalian death factor receptor, shares a limited homology with reaper, an apoptosis-inducing protein in Drosophila. Expression of either the Fas cytoplasmic region (FasC) or of reaper in Drosophila cells caused cell death. The death process induced by FasC or reaper was inhibited by crmA or p35, suggesting that its death process is mediated by caspase-like proteases. Both Ac-YVAD aldehyde and Ac-DEVD aldehyde, specific inhibitors of caspase 1- and caspase 3-like proteases, respectively, inhibited the FasC-induced death of Drosophila cells. However, the cell death induced by reaper was inhibited by Ac-DEVD aldehyde, but not by Ac-YVAD aldehyde. A caspase 1-like protease activity that preferentially recognizes the YVAD sequence gradually increased in the cytosolic fraction of the FasC-activated cells, whereas the caspase 3-like protease activity recognizing the DEVD sequence was observed in the reaper-activated cells. Partial purification and biochemical characterization of the proteases indicated that there are at least three distinct caspase-like proteases in Drosophila cells, which are differentially activated by FasC and reaper. The conservation of the Fas-death signaling pathway in Drosophila cells, which is distinct from that for reaper, may indicate that cell death in Drosophila is controlled not only by the reaper suicide gene, but also by a Fas-like killer gene.",1997,"T Kondo, T Yokokura, S Nagata, T Kondo, T Yokokura, S Nagata"

Role of the stimulatory proteins Sp1 and Sp3 in the regulation of transcription of the rat pyruvate kinase M gene,9128739,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.00174.x,Site-directed mutagenesis of cis-regulatory elements in the 5' flanking region of the rat pyruvate kinase M gene revealed that two out of the three GC boxes (-133/-124 and -48/-39) are involved in the stimulation of a core promoter (-35/+46). These two regions were also protected in DNaseI footprinting assays. Sp1 and Sp3 were identified as binding proteins to all three GC boxes by supershift experiments. Cotransfections in Drosophila SL2 cells revealed a strong stimulatory function of Sp1 and a synergistic effect of Sp3 to Sp1 in the activation of the pyruvate kinase M promoter. No inhibitory effect of Sp3 was detected. These data indicate that binding of Sp1 at two GC boxes is required for full promoter activity of the pyruvate kinase M gene and thus contributes to the observed cell-cycle-dependent expression of this enzyme in proliferating rat thymocytes.,1997,"R Netzker, C Weigert, K Brand, R Netzker, C Weigert, K Brand"

There are two hypotheses to explain the molecular mechanism of capacitative Ca2+ entry. One is that a diffusible second messenger released from intracellular Ca2+ stores may activate a Ca2+ channel at the plasma membrane. Numerous molecules, including CIF, cGMP, arachidonic acid, and a small G-protein, are proposed as the candidates for the diffusible messenger. In addition, the capacitative Ca2+ entry has been suggested to be modulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Another hypothesis is termed the ""conformational coupling model"". This model suggests that information between the IP3 receptor and a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel may be transferred directly through conformational protein-protein interactions. The plasma membrane Ca2+ channel involved in the capacitative Ca2+ entry is still neither purified nor cloned, but recent studies suggest that the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila protein Trp may function as a capacitative Ca2+ entry channel.",1997,"Y Tojyo, A Tanimura, Y Matsumoto, Y Tojyo, A Tanimura, Y Matsumoto"

CPR is a single copy gene as shown by genomic Southern hybridisation and maps to the cytogenetic map position 26C on the second chromosome. Comparison of genomic and cDNA CPR sequences revealed a gene structure that is split into at least six exons. The CPR protein sequence is almost identical with that of house fly and remarkably conserved when compared to vertebrates and yeast.

Environmental control of the cell cycle in Drosophila: nutrition activates mitotic and endoreplicative cells by distinct mechanisms,9570778,,"In newly hatched Drosophila larvae, quiescent cells reenter the cell cycle in response to dietary amino acids. To understand this process, we varied larval nutrition and monitored effects on cell cycle initiation and maintenance in the mitotic neuroblasts and imaginal disc cells, as well as the endoreplicating cells in other larval tissues. After cell cycle activation, mitotic and endoreplicating cells respond differently to the withdrawal of nutrition: mitotic cells continue to proliferate in a nutrition-independent manner, while most endoreplicating cells reenter a quiescent state. We also show that ectopic expression of Drosophila Cyclin E or the E2F transcription factor can drive quiescent endoreplicating cells, but not quiescent imaginal neuroblasts, into S-phase. Conversely, we demonstrate that quiescent imaginal neuroblasts, but not quiescent endoreplicating cells, can be induced to enter the cell cycle when co-cultured with larval fat body in vitro. These results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the control of cell cycle activation and maintenance in these two cell types, and imply the existence of a novel mitogen generated by the larval fat body in response to nutrition.",1998,"J S Britton, B A Edgar, J S Britton, B A Edgar"

Adenomatous polyposis coli is further expressed in neuronal cell bodies and/or nerve fibres in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, brain stem, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Adenomatous polyposis coli is demonstrated to be co-localized with beta-catenin and/or hDLG in neurons and nerve fibres, but not in astrocytes. From these results, adenomatous polyposis coli is suggested to participate in a signal transduction pathway in astrocytes which is independent of beta-catenin and hDLG, and also in regulation of neuronal functions in association with beta-catenin and hDLG.",1998,"T Senda, S Iino, K Matsushita, A Matsumine, S Kobayashi, T Akiyama, T Senda, S Iino, K Matsushita, A Matsumine, S Kobayashi, T Akiyama"
Wolbachia transfer from Drosophila melanogaster into D. simulans: Host effect and cytoplasmic incompatibility relationships,9725842,,"Wolbachia are maternally transmitted endocellular bacteria causing a reproductive incompatibility called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in several arthropod species, including Drosophila. CI results in embryonic mortality in incompatible crosses. The only bacterial strain known to infect Drosophila melanogaster (wDm) was transferred from a D. melanogaster isofemale line into uninfected D. simulans isofemale lines by embryo microinjections. Males from the resulting transinfected lines induce >98% embryonic mortality when crossed with uninfected D. simulans females. In contrast, males from the donor D. melanogaster line induce only 18-32% CI on average when crossed with uninfected D. melanogaster females. Transinfected D. simulans lines do not differ from the D. melanogaster donor line in the Wolbachia load found in the embryo or in the total bacterial load of young males. However, >80% of cysts are infected by Wolbachia in the testes of young transinfected males, whereas only 8% of cysts are infected in young males from the D. melanogaster donor isofemale line. This difference might be caused by physiological differences between hosts, but it might also involve tissue-specific control of Wolbachia density by D. melanogaster. The wDm-transinfected D. simulans lines are unidirectionally incompatible with strains infected by the non-CI expressor Wolbachia strains wKi, wMau, or wAu, and they are bidirectionally incompatible with strains infected by the CI-expressor Wolbachia strains wHa or wNo. However, wDm-infected males do not induce CI toward females infected by the CI-expressor strain wRi, which is found in D. simulans continental populations, while wRi-infected males induce partial CI toward wDm-infected females. This peculiar asymmetrical pattern could reflect an ongoing divergence between the CI mechanisms of wRi and wDm. It would also confirm other results indicating that the factor responsible for CI induction in males is distinct from the factor responsible for CI rescue in females.",1998,"D Poinsot, K Bourtzis, G Markakis, C Savakis, H Merçot, D Poinsot, K Bourtzis, G Markakis, C Savakis, H Merçot"
Long-range base pairing in Drosophila and human mRNA sequences,9656483,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025987,"The potential for long-range base pairing between the 5' and 3' ends of mRNA molecules was examined for 134 Drosophila and 204 human sequences collected from the GenBank database. Each sequence was divided into two parts, a 5' sequence taken from the start of the protein-encoding region and a 3' sequence taken from the end of the transcript. The strongest RNA pairing stem between each pair of 5' and 3' sequences was identified and scored using an alignment program modified to incorporate RNA base pairing. The observed pairing scores were then compared with a random distribution of scores generated by aligning each 5' sequence to random permutations of its corresponding 3' sequence. For both the Drosophila and the human mRNAs, the observed pairing scores were significantly biased toward the upper tail of the random distributions, with 61% of the Drosophila sequences and 64% of the human sequences falling within the upper half of the random distributions. This suggests that a pattern of long-range base pairing may be a common feature of eukaryotic mRNAs. We have also analyzed a subset of Drosophila and human mRNAs which show the greatest potential for long-range pairing. The human pairings appear to be stronger and localized to more specific regions near the ends of the mRNA sequence than those of Drosophila.",1998,"J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda, J Parsch, W Stephan, S Tanda"

Genotype-environment interaction at quantitative trait loci affecting sensory bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster,9691044,,"The magnitude of segregating variation for bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster exceeds that predicted from models of mutation-selection balance. To evaluate the hypothesis that genotype-environment interaction (GEI) maintains variation for bristle number in nature, we quantified the extent of GEI for abdominal and sternopleural bristles among 98 recombinant inbred lines, derived from two homozygous laboratory strains, in three temperature environments. There was considerable GEI for both bristle traits, which was mainly attributable to changes in rank order of line means. We conducted a genome-wide screen for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting bristle number in each sex and temperature environment, using a dense (3.2-cM) marker map of polymorphic insertion sites of roo transposable elements. Nine sternopleural and 11 abdominal bristle number QTLs were detected. Significant GEI was exhibited by 14 QTLs, but there was heterogeneity among QTLs in their sensitivity to thermal and sexual environments. To further evaluate the hypothesis that GEI maintains variation for bristle number, we require estimates of allelic effects across environments at genetic loci affecting the traits. This level of resolution may be achievable for Drosophila bristle number because candidate loci affecting bristle development often map to the same location as bristle number QTLs.",1998,"M C Gurganus, J D Fry, S V Nuzhdin, E G Pasyukova, R F Lyman, T F Mackay, M C Gurganus, J D Fry, S V Nuzhdin, E G Pasyukova, R F Lyman, T F Mackay"

The DNA encoding the variable regions of the 1.2B6 anti-E-selectin antibody were used to generate a recombinant sFv. This construct was cloned into the pHEN1 vector for expression in Escherichia coli and the pRmHa-3 vector to generate stably transfected Drosophila SC-2 cell lines. Following expression in the bacterial system, and using standard refolding protocols to obtain active material, it was shown that the majority of the sFv formed non-covalent aggregates. In addition SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that even the monomeric material was heterogeneous. In contrast, expression of sFv in Drosophila SC-2 cell lines allowed purification of active sFv directly from the culture supernatant. Only a small proportion of the sFv formed aggregates, and the purified material was homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE. Thus the use of stably transfected insect cells has a number of potential advantages in expressing recombinant antibody fragments.",1998,"D L Mahiouz, G Aichinger, D O Haskard, A J George, D L Mahiouz, G Aichinger, D O Haskard, A J George"
Opposing actions of CSW and RasGAP modulate the strength of Torso RTK signaling in the Drosophila terminal pathway,9885560,10.1016/s1097-2765(00)80287-7,"In Drosophila, specification of embryonic terminal cells is controlled by the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase. Here, we analyze the molecular basis of positive (Y630) and negative (Y918) phosphotyrosine (pY) signaling sites on Torso. We find that the Drosophila homolog of RasGAP associates with pY918 and is a negative effector of Torso signaling. Further, we show that the tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW), which associates with pY630, specifically dephosphorylates the negative pY918 Torso signaling site, thus identifying Torso to be a substrate of CSW in the terminal pathway. CSW also serves as an adaptor protein for DRK binding, physically linking Torso to Ras activation.

Multiple roles for notch in Drosophila myogenesis,9733574,10.1006/dbio.1998.8944,"Notch plays a role in many cell fate decisions in the developing Drosophila embryo, often at successive stages during the formation of a single tissue. In the embryonic mesoderm, Notch is involved in the process by which muscle progenitors are selected from a field of equivalent myoblasts. We have investigated the roles of Notch in somatic myogenesis and show that Notch can affect at least two additional steps in muscle development. Subsequent to the initial specification of progenitors, myoblast identity remains sensitive to mesodermal Notch activity until the time of fusion. Additionally, Notch is capable of suppressing muscle development nonautonomously by regulating a signal that emanates from the ectoderm.",1998,"S Fuerstenberg, E Giniger, S Fuerstenberg, E Giniger"
Eve and ftz regulate a wide array of genes in blastoderm embryos: the selector homeoproteins directly or indirectly regulate most genes in Drosophila,9778506,,"The selector homeoproteins are a highly conserved group of transcription factors found throughout the Eumetazoa. Previously, the Drosophila selector homeoproteins Eve and Ftz were shown to bind with similar specificities to all genes tested, including four genes chosen because they were thought to be unlikely targets of Eve and Ftz. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of these four unexpected targets is controlled by Eve and probably by the other selector homeoproteins as well. A correlation is observed between the level of DNA binding and the degree to which gene expression is regulated by Eve. Suspecting that the selector homeoproteins may affect many more genes than previously thought, we have characterized the expression of randomly selected genes at different stages of embryogenesis. At cellular blastoderm, 25-50% of genes whose transcription can be monitored are regulated by both Eve and Ftz. In late embryogenesis, 87% of genes are directly or indirectly controlled by most or all selector homeoproteins. We argue that this broad control of gene expression is essential to coordinate morphogenesis. Our results raise the possibility that each selector homeoprotein may directly regulate the expression of most genes.",1998,"Z Liang, M D Biggin, Z Liang, M D Biggin"
Midline Fasciclin: a Drosophila Fasciclin-I-related membrane protein localized to the CNS midline cells and trachea,9552168,10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(199804)35:1<77::aid-neu7>3.0.co;2-8,"Drosophila Fasciclin I is the prototype of a family of vertebrate and invertebrate proteins that mediate cell adhesion and signaling.

Midline Fasciclin largely consists of four 150 amino acid repeats characteristic of the Fasciclin I family of proteins. Immunostaining and biochemical analysis using Midline Fasciclin antibodies indicates that it is a membrane-associated protein, although the sequence does not reveal a transmembrane domain. The gene is expressed in a dynamic fashion during embryogenesis in the blastoderm, central nervous system midline cells, and trachea, suggesting it plays multiple developmental roles. Protein localization studies indicate that Midline Fasciclin is found within cell bodies of midline neurons and glia, and on midline axons. Initial cellular analysis of a midline fasciclin loss-of-function mutation reveals only weak defects in axonogenesis. However, embryos mutant for both midline fasciclin and the abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, show more severe defects in axonogenesis that resemble fasciclin I abelson double mutant phenotypes.",1998,"S Hu, M Sonnenfeld, S Stahl, S T Crews, S Hu, M Sonnenfeld, S Stahl, S T Crews"
Cysteine string protein is required for calcium secretion coupling of evoked neurotransmission in drosophila but not for vesicle recycling,9437017,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-03-00956.1998,"The entire deletion of the cysteine string protein (CSP) gene causes a temperature-sensitive (ts) block of evoked neurotransmission in Drosophila. CSP has been found to interact in vitro with the clathrin-uncoating ATPase HSC70, suggesting a potential role of CSP in vesicle recycling. Using FM1-43 imaging, we analyzed whether the ts block of neurotransmission in csp mutants is caused by a defect in vesicle exocytosis or vesicle recycling. We determined that FM1-43-labeled synaptic boutons of csp mutant neuromuscular junctions fail to destain at 32 degrees C after K+ depolarization, and that FM1-43 dye uptake cannot be evoked by K+ stimulation at 32 degrees C. However, when we stimulated dye uptake independent of depolarization by using black widow spider venom (BWSV), we observed endocytotic uptake of FM1-43. This suggests that endocytosis exhibits no primary ts defect. In addition, we found no ts defect of vesicle recycling at 32 degrees C that would correlate with the ts block of neurotransmission. We also discovered that BWSV and the calcium ionophore calcimycin stimulate FM1-43 destaining and quantal release in csp mutants at 32 degrees C when depolarization fails to evoke any response. The wild-type-like, calcimycin-induced response in csp null mutants indicates that some aspect of the depolarization-dependent calcium signaling pathway must be impaired, either calcium entry, calcium action, or both. Collectively, our results indicate that the csp mutation affects calcium secretion coupling of evoked exocytosis but not vesicle recycling. This supports the hypothesis that CSP links synaptic vesicles to calcium secretion coupling.",1998,"R Ranjan, P Bronk, K E Zinsmaier, R Ranjan, P Bronk, K E Zinsmaier"
Genetic analysis of extended life span in Drosophila melanogaster. II. Replication of the backcross test and molecular characterization of the N14 locus,9949700,10.1023/a:1003420625925,"We are interested in localizing chromosomal regions that extend life span in Drosophila. Using stocks artificially selected for long life by Luckinbill and his colleagues, we have identified marker loci that are highly divergent in allelic frequencies between replicated long-lived lines and controls (Curtsinger et al., 1998). Several of the most divergent loci have been found to be associated with effects on life span in segregating backcross populations. Here we report an independent replication of the backcross test for the N14 marker locus, previously reported to extend male life spans by 12 days. The life span effect successfully replicates in males. N14 accounts for 30% of the total selection response in males. Life span extension occurs by a decrease in age-specific mortality rates at all ages, and is not attributable to modification of the slope of the age-specific mortality curve. The effect in females is small or nonexistent. Sequencing of the N14 locus shows that it is non-coding and not obviously regulatory, suggesting that the phenotypic effect arises from linkage disequilibrium with another locus or loci that directly affect life span. N14 DNA hybridizes to 63F/64A on the left arm of chromosome 3. The location is consistent with previous whole-chromosome substitution studies, and suggests new candidate genes for life span extension in Drosophila, including ras2.",1998,"A S Resler, K Kelly, G Kantor, A A Khazaeli, M Tatar, J W Curtsinger, A S Resler, K Kelly, G Kantor, A A Khazaeli, M Tatar, J W Curtsinger"
Regulation of RNA polymerase I-dependent promoters by the hepatitis B virus X protein via activated Ras and TATA-binding protein,9819395,10.1128/mcb.18.12.7086,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein is essential for viral infectivity, and evidence indicates that it is a strong contributor to HBV-mediated oncogenesis. X has been shown to transactivate a wide variety of RNA polymerase (Pol) II-dependent, as well as RNA Pol III-dependent, promoters. In this study, we have investigated the possibility that X modulates RNA Pol I-dependent rRNA transcription. In both human hepatoma Huh7 and Drosophila Schneider S2 cell lines, X expression stimulated rRNA promoter activity. Extracts prepared from X-expressing cells stably transfected with an X gene also exhibited an increased ability to transcribe the rRNA promoter. The mechanism for X transactivation was examined by determining whether this regulatory event was dependent on Ras activation and increased TATA-binding protein (TBP) levels. Our previous studies have demonstrated that X, and the activation of Ras, produces an increase in the cellular levels of TBP (H.-D. Wang, A. Trivedi, and D. L. Johnson, Mol. Cell. Biol. 17:6838-6846, 1997). Expression of a dominant negative form of Ras blocked the X-mediated induction of the rRNA promoters, whereas expression of a constitutively activated form of Ras mimicked the enhancing effect of X on rRNA promoter activity. When TBP was overexpressed in either Huh7 or S2 cells, a dose-dependent increase in rRNA promoter activity was observed. To analyze whether the increase in TBP was modulating rRNA promoter activity indirectly, by increasing activity of RNA Pol II-dependent promoters, a Drosophila TBP cDNA was constructed with a mutation that eliminated its ability to stimulate RNA Pol II-dependent promoters. Transient expression of wild-type TBP in S2 cells increased the activities of specific RNA Pol I- and Pol II-dependent promoters. Expression of the mutant TBP protein failed to enhance the activity of the RNA Pol II-dependent promoters, yet the protein completely retained its ability to stimulate the rRNA promoter. Furthermore, the addition of recombinant TBP to S2 extracts stimulated rRNA promoter activity in vitro. Together, these results demonstrate that the HBV X protein up-regulates RNA Pol I-dependent promoters via a Ras-activated pathway in two distinct cell lines. The enhanced promoter activity can, at least in part, be attributed to the X- and Ras-mediated increase in cellular TBP, a limiting transcription component.",1998,"H D Wang, A Trivedi, D L Johnson, H D Wang, A Trivedi, D L Johnson"
Genomic organization of the segment polarity gene pan in Drosophila melanogaster,9613571,10.1007/s004380050705,"We previously described the molecular cloning of a mammalian T cell factor 1 (TCF-1)-like protein from Drosophila melanogaster, encoded by the pangolin (pan) locus, and demonstrated that it consists of a DNA binding domain similar to that of other high mobility group proteins and a protein-protein interaction domain that binds beta-catenin (Armadillo in Drosophila) but that it lacks a transcriptional activation domain. Here we show that the pan locus spans approximately 50 kb and the mRNA results from the splicing of 13 exons. We note remarkable conservation of the exon/intron boundaries between the human and D. melanogaster genes, suggesting that they share a common ancestor. Chromosomal in situ hybridization locates pan to the base of chromosome 4, near the cubitus interruptus locus. Restriction map and sequence analyses confirm their close proximity. The small fourth chromosome undergoes little or no recombination and was previously reported to lack DNA polymorphisms; however, we note two DNA polymorphisms occurring in three combinations within the pan locus, demonstrating the presence of synonymous substitutions and the past occurrence of recombination.

Binding of trithorax and Polycomb proteins to the bithorax complex: dynamic changes during early Drosophila embryogenesis,9724650,10.1093/emboj/17.17.5141,"In Drosophila, the maintenance of developmentally important transcription patterns is controlled at the level of chromatin structure. The Polycomb group (PcG) and trithorax group (trxG) genes encode proteins involved in chromatin remodelling. PcG genes have been proposed to act by packaging transcriptional repressed chromosomal domains into condensed heterochromatin-like structures. Some of the trxG proteins characterized so far are members of chromatin opening complexes (e.g. SWI/SNF and GAGA/NURF) which facilitate binding of transcription factors and components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Genetic and biochemical data suggest that these two groups of regulatory factors may act through a common set of DNA elements. In the present study, we have investigated the binding of Trithorax (TRX) and Polycomb (PC) protein in the bithorax complex (BX-C) during embryogenesis. In addition, we have identified the minimal fragments from the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) regulatory region that are capable of recruiting TRX to chromosomal sites containing them. Comparative analysis of the binding of the two proteins shows that TRX and PC bind target sequences (PcG-regulated elements, PREs) by cellular blastoderm, when BX-C transcription begins. At the same stage, TRX but not PC is strongly associated with core promoters. Later, at germ band extension, the time of derepression in Polycomb mutants, PC binding is also detected outside core PREs and additionally binds to the fragments containing promoters.",1998,"V Orlando, E P Jane, V Chinwalla, P J Harte, R Paro, V Orlando, E P Jane, V Chinwalla, P J Harte, R Paro"

Mutations in ccf give rise to late larvae with small imaginal discs and to adults showing appendages of reduced size, consistent with CCF involvement in cell proliferation. Neuroblast squash analyses show that CCF is required for proper condensation of mitotic chromosomes and, therefore, for progression through mitosis. Furthermore, we observe that adult ccf mutants as well as animals overexpressing CCF during larval stages exhibit homeotic transformations. We also find that mutations in the Pc-G genes Polycomb, polyhomeotic and Enhancer of zeste are enhanced by ccf mutations. Finally, we show that the CCF protein binds to specific sites on polytene chromosomes, many of which are shared with the Posterior sex combs Pc-G protein.

The GFS has been intensively studied physiologically in both wild-type and mutant flies, and is often used as a system to study the effects of neural mutations on the physiology of the adult nervous system. Recently, much information has been gleaned as to how and when synaptogenesis, with its major target neurons, is achieved. However, little is known of the earlier development of this neuron. Here we have used an enhancer-trap, marking parts of the GFS, in conjunction with BrdU labelling, to attempt to follow the birth, axonogenesis, and the early morphological meeting of the GFs with their target neurons. From these anatomical observations we propose that the GF cell is not born during the larval or pupal stages and, therefore. appears to be a persistent embryonic cell. The axons of the GFs develop during the third instar. During the early pupal stages the GFs contact other identified neurons of the GFS. In addition, we see some aberrant development of the network, with some flies carrying only one GF, and yet others with extended axons.

Inner ear and maternal reproductive defects in mice lacking the Hmx3 homeobox gene,9435283,,"The Hmx homeobox gene family is of ancient origin, being present in species as diverse as Drosophila, sea urchin and mammals. The three members of the murine Hmx family, designated Hmx1, Hmx2 and Hmx3, are expressed in tissues that suggest a common functional role in sensory organ development and pregnancy. Hmx3 is one of the earliest markers for vestibular inner ear development during embryogenesis, and is also upregulated in the myometrium of the uterus during pregnancy. Targeted disruption of the Hmx3 gene results in mice with abnormal circling behavior and severe vestibular defects owing to a depletion of sensory cells in the saccule and utricle, and a complete loss of the horizontal semicircular canal crista, as well as a fusion of the utricle and saccule endolymphatic spaces into a common utriculosaccular cavity. Both the sensory and secretory epithelium of the cochlear duct appear normal in the Hmx3 null animals. The majority of Hmx3 null females have a reproductive defect. Hmx3 null females can be fertilized and their embryos undergo normal preimplantation development, but the embryos fail to implant successfully in the Hmx3 null uterus and subsequently die. Transfer of preimplantation embryos from mutant Hmx3 uterine horns to wild-type pseudopregnant females results in successful pregnancy, indicating a failure of the Hmx3 null uterus to support normal post-implantation pregnancy. Molecular analysis revealed the perturbation of Hmx, Wnt and LIF gene expression in the Hmx3 null uterus.

Expression of tll is normally confined to the optic lobe primordium, whereas ato appears in a subset of Bolwig's organ cells that we call Bolwig's organ founders. Phenotypic analysis, using specific markers for Bolwig's organ and the optic lobe, of tll loss- and gain-of-function mutant embryos reveals that tll functions to drive cells to optic lobe as opposed to Bolwig's organ fate. Similar experiments indicate that ato has the opposite effect, namely driving cells to a Bolwig's organ fate. Since we can show that tll and ato do not regulate each other, we propose a model wherein tll expression restricts the ability of cells to respond to signaling arising from ato-expressing Bolwig's organ pioneers. Our data further suggest that the Bolwig's organ founder cells produce Spitz (the Drosophila TGFalpha homolog) signal, which is passed to the neighboring secondary Bolwig's organ cells where it activates the EGFR signaling cascade and maintains the fate of these secondary cells. The regulators of tll expression in the embryonic visual system remain elusive, as we were unable to find evidence for regulation by the 'early eye genes' so, eya and ey, or by EGFR signaling.",1999,"A Daniel, K Dumstrei, J A Lengyel, V Hartenstein, A Daniel, K Dumstrei, J A Lengyel, V Hartenstein"
Paleo-demography of the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup: application of the maximum likelihood method,10650839,10.1266/ggs.74.117,"The species divergence times and demographic histories of Drosophila melanogaster and its three sibling species, D. mauritiana, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, were investigated using a maximum likelihood (ML) method. Thirty-nine orthologous loci for these four species were retrieved from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database. Both autosomal and X-linked loci were used in this study. A significant degree of rate heterogeneity across loci was observed for each pair of species. Most loci have the GC content greater than 50% at the third codon position. The codon usage bias in Drosophila loci is considered to result in the high GC content and the heterogenous rates across loci. The chi-square, G, and Fisher's exact tests indicated that data sets with 11, 23, and 9 pairs of DNA sequences for the comparison of D. melanogaster with D. mauritiana, D. simulans, and D. yakuba, respectively, retain homogeneous rates across loci. We applied the ML method to these data sets to estimate the DNA sequence divergences before and after speciation of each species pair along with their standard deviations. Using 1.6 x 10(-8) as the rate of nucleotide substitutions per silent site per year, our results indicate that the D. melanogaster lineage split from D. yakuba approximately 5.1 +/- 0.8 million years ago (mya), D. mauritiana 2.7 +/- 0.4 mya, and D. simulans 2.3 +/- 0.3 mya. It implies that D. melanogaster became distinct from D. mauritiana and D. simulans at approximately the same time and from D. yakuba no earlier than 10 mya. The effective ancestral population size of D. melanogaster appears to be stable over evolutionary time. Assuming 10 generations per year for Drosophila, the effective population size in the ancestral lineage immediately prior to the time of species divergence is approximately 3 x 10(6), which is close to that estimated for the extant D. melanogaster population. The D. melanogaster did not encounter any obvious bottleneck during the past 10 million years.",1999,"Y J Li, Y Satta, N Takahata, Y J Li, Y Satta, N Takahata"
The Drosophila GMII gene encodes a Golgi alpha-mannosidase II,10504337,,"In this paper we show the organisation of the Drosophila gene encoding a Golgi alpha-mannosidase II. We demonstrate that it encodes a functional homologue of the mouse Golgi alpha-mannosidase II. The Drosophila and mouse cDNA sequences translate into amino acid sequences which show 41% identity and 61% similarity. Expression of the Drosophila GMII sequence in CHOP cells produces an enzyme which has mannosidase activity and is inhibited by swainsonine and by CuSO(4.) In cultured Drosophila cells and in Drosophila embryos, antibodies raised against a C-terminal peptide localise this product mainly to the Golgi apparatus as identified by cryo-immuno electron microscopy studies and by antibodies raised against known mammalian Golgi proteins.

Drosophila neurons respond differently to hypoxia and cyanide than rat neurons,10529438,10.1016/s0006-8993(99)01877-6,"Compared with mammalian species, Drosophila melanogaster exhibits marked tolerance to hypoxia or anoxia. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms of tolerance are still largely unknown. In order to assess the electrophysiologic response to O(2) lack in Drosophila neurons and compare them to those in mammals, we used neurons from embryonic cultures of both Drosophila and rat. We studied the effects of hypoxia on membrane potential V(m), input resistance R(m), rheobase, and action potential characteristics before, during and after 3 to 5 min of hypoxia (measured PO(2)<20 Torr). In Drosophila neurons, on the one hand, V(m) reversibly hyperpolarized with hypoxia by an average of about 20 mV and input resistance decreased by 71% from control. In most cells studied, action potential (AP) amplitude decreased, its duration increased, and its threshold shifted in a hyperpolarized direction before AP generation was attenuated. On the other hand, V(m) in rat cortical neurons reversibly depolarized by an average of 10 mV with hypoxia. Input resistance was reversibly reduced by 58% and, in most cells studied, AP amplitude also decreased and its duration increased. In contrast to the effects of hypoxia on V(m), CN caused a depolarization by 22 mV and a slight increase in R(m) in Drosophila. In the rat, CN was similar to hypoxia in its effect on R(m). We conclude that (1) rat and Drosophila neurons decrease their excitability in hypoxia by activating different mechanisms; (2) the most likely explanation for the hyperpolarization and the decrease in R(m) in Drosophila neurons is the activation of a K(+) conductance; this activation, by itself, cannot explain the results in rat neurons and (3) hypoxia and cyanide have similar effects in rat neurons but are divergent in their effects in Drosophila neurons.",1999,"X Q Gu, G G Haddad, X Q Gu, G G Haddad"
The proapoptotic function of Drosophila Hid is conserved in mammalian cells,10220397,10.1073/pnas.96.9.4936,"Three genes-reaper, grim, and hid-are crucial to the regulation of programmed cell death in Drosophila melanogaster. Mutations involving all three genes virtually abolish apoptosis during development, and homozygous hid mutants die as embryos with extensive defects in apoptosis. Although Hid is central to apoptosis in Drosophila, it has no mammalian homologue identified to date. We present evidence that expression of Drosophila Hid in mammalian cells induces apoptosis. This activity is subject to regulation by inhibitors of mammalian cell death. We show that the N terminus of Hid, which is a region of homology with Reaper and Grim, is essential for Hid's function in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that Hid is localized to the mitochondria via a hydrophobic region at its C terminus and functionally interacts with BclXL. This study shows that the function of Hid as a death inducer in Drosophila is conserved in mammalian cells and argues for the existence of a mammalian homologue of this critical regulator of apoptosis.",1999,"W N Haining, C Carboy-Newcomb, C L Wei, H Steller, W N Haining, C Carboy-Newcomb, C L Wei, H Steller"
The pharmacological flexibility of the insect voltage gated sodium channel: toxicity of AaIT to knockdown resistant (kdr) flies,10528405,10.1016/s0965-1748(99)00079-x,"AaIT is an insect selective neurotoxic polypeptide shown to affect insect neuronal sodium conductance by binding to excitable sodium channels. In the present study the paralytic potency of AaIT to wild type and various mutant strains of houseflies (Musca domestica) and fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster) was examined and it has been shown that: On the basis of body weight when compared to published data on Sarcophaga falculata blowflies, the Musca and Drosophila flies reveal at least two orders of magnitude decreased susceptibility to the AaIT. When compared to wild type flies the toxicity of AaIT is greatly altered in knockdown resistant fly strains which are mutated in their para gene encoding the voltage gated sodium channel. Several strains, with genetically mapped para mutations conferring pyrethroid resistance, exhibited opposing response to AaIT. The para ts2 Drosophila strain, with a point of mutation in domain I of the para gene conferring a 6-fold resistance to deltamethrin also showed about 15-fold tolerance to AaIT. On the other hand the Musca kdr and super-kdr flies, with a single or a double point mutation, respectively in domain II of the para gene, are about 9- and 14-fold more susceptible to AaIT, respectively. The above data are interpreted in terms of the pharmacological diversity and flexibility (""allosteric coupling"") of voltage gated sodium channels and their implications for the management of pesticide resistance are discussed.",1999,"E Zlotkin, A L Devonshire, J W Warmke, E Zlotkin, A L Devonshire, J W Warmke"

Here we examined the effects of Drosophila DE-cadherin expression on spectrin and ankyrin in Drosophila S2 tissue culture cells. DE-cadherin caused a dramatic change in the cytoplasmic concentration and distribution of armadillo, the Drosophila homolog of beta catenin. However, DE-cadherin expression had no detectable effect on the quantity or subcellular distribution of ankyrin or spectrin. In reciprocal experiments, recruitment of ankyrin and alphabeta spectrin to the plasma membrane by another cell adhesion molecule, neuroglian, had no effect on the quantity or distribution of armadillo. The results indicate that DE-cadherin-catenin complexes and neuroglian-spectrin/ankyrin complexes form by nonintersecting pathways.

"The mouse bagpipe gene controls development of axial skeleton, skull, and spleen",10449756,10.1073/pnas.96.17.9695,"The mouse Bapx1 gene is homologous to the Drosophila homeobox containing bagpipe (bap) gene. A shared characteristic of the genes in these two organisms is expression in gut mesoderm. In Drosophila, bap functions to specify the formation of the musculature of the midgut. To determine the function of the mammalian cognate, we targeted a mutation into the Bapx1 locus. Bapx1, similar to Drosophila, does have a conspicuous role in gut mesoderm; however, this appears to be restricted to development of the spleen. In addition, Bapx1 has a major role in the development of the axial skeleton. Loss of Bapx1 affects the distribution of sclerotomal cells, markedly reducing the number that appear ventromedially around the notochord. Subsequently, the structures in the midaxial region, the intervertebral discs, and centra of the vertebral bodies, fail to form. Abnormalities are also found in those bones of the basal skull (basioccipital and basisphenoid bones) associated with the notochord. We postulate that Bapx1 confers the capacity of cells to interact with the notochord, effecting inductive interactions essential for development of the vertebral column and chondrocranium.",1999,"L A Lettice, L A Purdie, G J Carlson, F Kilanowski, J Dorin, R E Hill, L A Lettice, L A Purdie, G J Carlson, F Kilanowski, J Dorin, R E Hill"
The nonrandom location of synonymous codons suggests that reading frame-independent forces have patterned codon preferences,10368432,10.1007/pl00006532,"Biased codon usage is common in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. Evidence from Escherichia, Saccharomyces, and Drosophila indicates that it favors translational efficiency and accuracy. However, to date no functional advantages have been identified in the codon-anticodon interactions involving the most frequently used (preferred) codons. Here we present evidence that forces not related to the individual codon-anticodon interaction may be involved in determining which synonymous codons are preferred or avoided. We show that the ""off-frame"" trinucleotide motif preferences inferrable from Drosophila coding regions are often in the same direction as Drosophila's ""in-frame"" codon preferences, i.e., its codon usage. The off-frame preferences were inferred from the nonrandomness of the location of confamilial synonymous codons along coding regions-a pattern often described as a context dependence of nucleotide choice at synonymous positions or as codon-pair bias. We relied on randomizations of the location of confamilial codons that do not alter, and cannot be influenced by, the encoded amino acid sequences, codon usage, or base composition of the genes examined. The statistically significant congruency of in-frame and off-frame trinucleotide preferences suggests that the same kind of reading-frame-independent force(s) may also influence synonymous codon choice. These forces may have produced biases in codon usage that then led to the evolution of the translational advantages of these motifs as preferred codons. Under this scenario, tRNA pool size differences between preferred and nonpreferred codons initially were evolved to track the default overrepresentation of codons with preferred motifs. The motif preference hypothesis can explain the structuring of codon preferences and the similarities in the codon usages of distantly related organisms.",1999,"M A Antezana, M Kreitman, M A Antezana, M Kreitman"
"A Drosophila clathrin light-chain gene: sequence, mapping, and absence of neuronal specialization",10098605,10.1089/104454999315457,"Because mammalian light chains have been implicated in the regulation of clathrin coat assembly and neuronal specialization of clathrin-mediated vesicle trafficking, a clathrin light-chain gene of Drosophila has been sought as a genetically tractable model for these developmental membrane-trafficking systems. A light-chain gene has been identified and its expression examined in various developmental stages and tissues by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A cDNA clone, originally identified from a partial sequence in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project EST database, has been sequenced completely and shown to encode a polypeptide with extensive sequence similarity to vertebrate and invertebrate clathrin light chains. Secondary structure algorithms predict an extensive coiled-coil over a region extending from amino acid residues 100 to 170, in excellent agreement with previous analyses of mammalian light chains. By in situ hybridization to larval polytene chromosomes, the gene has been mapped to cytologic position 77A on the left arm of chromosome 3. An RT-PCR analysis, coupled with PCR analysis of genomic DNA, showed that there is no neural specialization of the Drosophila clathrin light chain corresponding to that observed in mammalian neuronal light chains. The neuron-specific alternative splicing of clathrin light chains thus appears to be restricted to vertebrates, where it may contribute to the more complex information-processing capacity of higher nervous systems.",1999,"K Vasyukevich, C Bazinet, K Vasyukevich, C Bazinet"
"TID1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor l(2)tid, encodes two mitochondrial modulators of apoptosis with opposing functions",10411904,10.1073/pnas.96.15.8499,"Mitochondria have emerged as central regulators of apoptosis. Here, we show that TID1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor lethal (2) tumorous imaginal discs, l(2)tid, encodes two mitochondrial matrix proteins, designated hTid-1(L) and hTid-1(S). These splice variants are both highly conserved members of the DnaJ family of proteins, which regulate the activity of and confer substrate specificity to Hsp70 proteins. Both hTid-1(L) and hTid-1(S) coimmunoprecipitate with mitochondrial Hsp70. Expression of hTid-1(L) or hTid-1(S) have no apparent capacity to induce apoptosis but have opposing effects on apoptosis induced by exogenous stimuli. Expression of hTid-1(L) increases apoptosis induced by both the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin c and tumor necrosis factor alpha. This activity is J domain-dependent, because a J domain mutant of hTid-1(L) can dominantly suppress apoptosis. In sharp contrast, expression of hTid-1(S) suppresses apoptosis, whereas expression of a J domain mutant of hTid-1(S) increases apoptosis. Hence, we propose that TID1 gene products act to positively and negatively modulate apoptotic signal transduction or effector structures within the mitochondrial matrix.",1999,"J Syken, T De-Medina, K Münger, J Syken, T De-Medina, K Münger"

Mutation and deletion of this region has been reported in BCCs using frozen tumor tissue. The objective of this study was to test whether LOH of human PTC on chromosome 9q22 could be detected in archival sporadic BCCs. We studied 20 randomly selected sporadic BCCs by microdissection and polymerase chain reaction using paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed material on glass slides. In all cases, analysis was performed with the polymorphic markers D9S53, D9S15, D9S287, and D9S303.

We found that all lines show a Ubx-like beta-galactosidase expression pattern in the embryo, but proximity to strong imaginal enhancers can change this pattern drastically.

Drosophila head segmentation factor buttonhead interacts with the same TATA box-binding protein-associated factors and in vivo DNA targets as human Sp1 but executes a different biological program,10220418,10.1073/pnas.96.9.5061,"The Drosophila gene buttonhead (btd) is required for the establishment of three embryonic head segments.

Furthermore, BTD and Sp1 are capable of activating transcription in transfected cultured cells through interaction with the same DNA target sites. Herein we show that BTD and Sp1 functionally interact with the same TATA box-binding protein-associated factors and support in vitro transcription activation through these contacts. Transgene expression of BTD results in the rescue of the head segments that fail to develop in btd mutant embryos, whereas Sp1 or Sp1 containing the zinc finger region of BTD rescues mandibular segment development.

The eag family of K+ channels in Drosophila and mammals,10414305,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb11297.x,"Mutations of eag, first identified in Drosophila on the basis of their leg-shaking phenotype, cause repetitive firing and enhanced transmitter release in motor neurons. The encoded EAG polypeptide is related both to voltage-gated K+ channels and to cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels. Homology screens identified a family of eag-related channel polypeptides, highly conserved from nematodes to humans, comprising three subfamilies: EAG, ELK, and ERG. When expressed in frog oocytes, EAG channels behave as voltage-dependent, outwardly rectifying K(+)-selective channels. Mutations of the human eag-related gene (HERG) result in a form of cardiac arrhythmia that can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have provided evidence that HERG channels specify one component of the delayed rectifier, IKr, that contributes to the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. An important role for HERG channels in neuronal excitability is also suggested by the expression of these channels in brain tissue. Moreover, mutations of ERG-type channels in the Drosophila sei mutant cause temperature-induced convulsive seizures associated with aberrant bursting activity in the flight motor pathway. The in vivo function of ELK channels has not yet been established, but when these channels are expressed in frog oocytes, they display properties intermediate between those of EAG- and ERG-type channels. Coexpression of the K(+)-channel beta subunit encoded by Hk with EAG in oocytes dramatically increases current amplitude and also affects the gating and modulation of these currents. Biochemical evidence indicates a direct physical interaction between EAG and HK proteins. Overall, these studies highlight the diverse properties of the eag family of K+ channels, which are likely to subserve diverse functions in vivo.",1999,"B Ganetzky, G A Robertson, G F Wilson, M C Trudeau, S A Titus, B Ganetzky, G A Robertson, G F Wilson, M C Trudeau, S A Titus"
Cloning of karyopherin-alpha3 from Drosophila through its interaction with the nuclear localization sequence of germ cell-less protein,10614818,10.1515/BC.1999.161,"The D. melanogaster germ cell-less (gcl) gene has previously been shown to play a key role in the establishment of the germ cell lineage during fly embryogenesis. To identify other molecules that function with Gcl in this process, we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen that utilized Gcl protein as bait. A predominant class of Gcl-interacting clones encodes a species of importin-alpha from Drosophila (karyopherin-alpha3; kap-alpha3), a nuclear-localization sequence binding protein previously shown to act in the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The expression of kap-alpha3 is widespread both temporally and spatially throughout the embryo during development, as judged by Northern blotting and whole-mount in situ hybridization to Drosophila embryos, suggesting that it functions at multiple stages of development. Studies of the Gcl/Kap-alpha3 interaction have identified a functional nuclear-localization sequence in Gcl protein which is necessary for an in vivo interaction and for nuclear entry of Gcl, making it likely that one role for Kap-alpha3 is to deliver Gcl protein to the nucleus. The identification of Kap-alpha3 and an in vivo substrate will allow for further characterization of the basis for specificity between importin-alpha molecules and their binding substrates.",1999,"T C Dockendorff, Z Tang, T A Jongens, T C Dockendorff, Z Tang, T A Jongens"

"The homeobox gene, Xanf-1, can control both neural differentiation and patterning in the presumptive anterior neurectoderm of the Xenopus laevis embryo",10498686,,"From the onset of neurectoderm differentiation, homeobox genes of the Anf class are expressed within a region corresponding to the presumptive telencephalic and rostral diencephalic primordia. Here we investigate functions of the Xenopus member of Anf, Xanf-1, in the differentiation of the anterior neurectoderm. We demonstrate that ectopic Xanf-1 can expand the neural plate at expense of adjacent non-neural ectoderm. In tadpoles, the expanded regions of the plate developed into abnormal brain outgrowths. At the same time, Xanf-1 can inhibit terminal differentiation of primary neurones. We also show that, during gastrula/neurula stages, the exogenous Xanf-1 can downregulate four transcription regulators, XBF-1, Otx-2, Pax-6 and the endogenous Xanf-1, that are expressed in the anterior neurectoderm. However, during further development, when the exogenous Xanf-1 was presumably degraded, re-activation of XBF-1, Otx-2 and Pax-6 was observed in the abnormal outgrowths developed from blastomeres microinjected with Xanf-1 mRNA. Other effects of the ectopic Xanf-1 include cyclopic phenotype and inhibition of the cement gland, both by Otx-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Using fusions of Xanf-1 with the repressor domain of Drosophila engrailed or activator domain of herpes virus VP16 protein, we showed that most of the observed effects of Xanf-1 were probably elicited by its functioning as a transcription repressor.

It is noteworthy that the patients with high-grade PLK overexpression represented a significantly poorer prognosis group than those with low-grade PLK overexpression (3-year survival rate: 54.9% vs 24.8%, p<0.05). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the PLK mRNA expression status was an independent prognostic factor for patients with esophageal carcinoma.

The evolution of the hedgehog gene family in chordates: insights from amphioxus hedgehog,9914417,10.1007/s004270050225,"The hedgehog family of intercellular signalling molecules have essential functions in patterning both Drosophila and vertebrate embryos. Drosophila has a single hedgehog gene, while vertebrates have evolved at least three types of hedgehog genes (the Sonic, Desert and Indian types) by duplication and divergence of a single ancestral gene. Vertebrate Sonic-type genes typically show conserved expression in the notochord and floor plate, while Desert- and Indian-type genes have different patterns of expression in vertebrates from different classes. To determine the ancestral role of hedgehog in vertebrates, I have characterised the hedgehog gene family in amphioxus. Amphioxus is the closest living relative of the vertebrates and develops a similar body plan, including a dorsal neural tube and notochord. A single amphioxus hedgehog gene, AmphiHh, was identified and is probably the only hedgehog family member in amphioxus, showing the duplication of hedgehog genes to be specific to the vertebrate lineage. AmphiHh expression was detected in the notochord and ventral neural tube, tissues that express Sonic-type genes in vertebrates. This shows that amphioxus probably patterns its ventral neural tube using a molecular pathway conserved with vertebrates. AmphiHh was also expressed on the left side of the pharyngeal endoderm, reminiscent of the left-sided expression of Sonic hedgehog in chick embryos which forms part of a pathway controlling left/right asymmetric development. These data show that notochord, floor plate and possibly left/right asymmetric expression are ancestral sites of hedgehog expression in vertebrates and amphioxus. In vertebrates, all these features have been retained by Sonic-type genes. This may have freed Desert-type and Indian-type hedgehog genes from selective constraint, allowing them to diverge and take on new roles in different vertebrate taxa.",1999,"S M Shimeld, S M Shimeld"
Immunolocalization of a tachykinin-receptor-like protein in the central nervous system of Locusta migratoria migratorioides and neobellieria bullata,10320221,,"Antisera raised against two distinct peptide regions of the Drosophila neurokinin-like receptor NKD were used to immunolocalize tachykinin-receptor-like proteins in the central nervous system of two insect species: the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, and the gray fleshfly, Neobellieria bullata. The resulting immunopositive staining patterns were identical for both antisera. Moreover, a very similar distribution of the immunoreactive material was observed in fleshflies and locusts. Immunoreactivity was found in nerve terminals of the retrocerebral complex, suggesting a presynaptic localization of the receptor in this part of the brain. Cell bodies were stained in the subesophageal ganglion: an anterior group of four larger cells and a posterior group of about 20 cells. These cells have axons projecting into the contralateral nervus corporis allati (NCA) II, bypassing the corpus allatum and projecting through the NCA I into the storage part of the corpus cardiacum. In the glandular part of the corpus cardiacum, the glandular adipokinetic hormone-producing cells did not show any immunopositive staining.

The puff-specific RRM protein NonA is a single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein,10398845,10.1007/s004120050365,"The chromatin protein NonA from Drosophila, present in many puffs on polytene chromosomes, belongs to the growing class of RRM proteins. Exchange of amino acids within the RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences, known from other RRM proteins to be essential for RNA binding, has been shown drastically to reduce NonA function in vivo. Here we compare NonA binding to RNA from the Sgs-4 gene, an in situ target for NonA, with binding to Sgs-3 RNA, which is not a target of NonA. Using an immunoprecipitation assay in vitro we show that NonA binds to single-stranded (ss)DNA and RNA with moderate affinity (KD=8x10(-8) M). However, we did not observe sequence-specific binding to the Sgs-4 transcript nor to Sgs-4 DNA containing upstream regulatory sequences. Point mutations within the RNP1 and RNP2 consensus sequences that interfere with NonA function in vivo do not significantly change chromosomal binding nor the general affinity for RNA.

Use of an hsp70-regulated helper increased this frequency more than eight-fold. Transformation with a vector marked with white and green fluorescent protein (GFP) under polyubiquitin-nuclear localizing sequence regulation yielded seventy G1 transformants which all expressed GFP, but only twenty-seven of these expressed eye pigmentation that would have allowed their selection based on white+ expression.

This difference at the peripheral site, together with the kinetics of W121A and W359L mutants, suggests coordinate action of important hydrophobic residues that form the active site gorge during the catalytic process.

Measuring Drosophila (fruit fly) activity during microgravity exposure,11543046,,"Important advances in the understanding of the aging process could be obtained through comprehension of the changes experienced by Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) during microgravity. Previous experiments flown on Cosmos satellites and various Space Shuttle missions have shown a significant decrease in the life span of young male Drosophila after microgravity exposure. Additionally, postflight analysis indicated an accelerated aging of the microgravity exposed male flies since they exhibited a significant decrease in mating ability and a consistently lower negative geotaxis response than the 1 g ground controls. The negative geotaxis response is the Drosophila's reaction to move opposite to the Earth's gravitational vector when disturbed in certain manners. Researchers have hypothesized that the accelerated aging, is due to an increased locomotor activity which causes a subsequent increase in mitochondrial activity. The increased mitochondrial activity, in turn, causes increased aging through accelerated damage to the mitochondrial system. An increase in locomotor activity was indicated by analyzing only a fraction (1/6th of a second) of the 15 minute video recordings of groups of Drosophila taken approximately every two days during a 14-day Space Shuttle flight. The increased locomotor activity may be related to the Drosophila's negative geotaxis response in that the flies may be reacting to the absence of normal gravity by continuously searching for the gravity vector. The aims of this study are to develop methods to accurately measure individual Drosophila activity, use these derived methods in 1 g to create a Drosophila activity baseline, and use the methods during short and long duration microgravity exposure (sounding rockets, parabolic flights, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, etc.) to examine Drosophila activity. The role of the negative geotaxis response on locomotor activity will be examined by using two strains of behaviorally selected Drosophila, one that exhibits a large or hyper negative geotaxis response and another that has a positive geotaxis response, in addition to examining flies with a normal or negative geotaxis response.",1999,"M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller, M S Miller, T S Keller, M S Miller"
Life-History Consequences of Divergent Selection on Egg Size in Drosophila melanogaster,10506548,10.1086/303242,"Life histories are generally assumed to evolve via antagonistic pleiotropy (negative genetic correlations) among traits, and trade-offs between life-history traits are typically studied using either phenotypic manipulations or selection experiments. We investigated the trade-off between egg size and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster by examining both the phenotypic and genetic relationships between these traits after artificial selection for large and small eggs, relative to female body size. Egg size responded strongly to selection in both directions, increasing in the large-egg selected lines and decreasing in the small-egg selected lines. Phenotypic correlations between egg size and fecundity in the large-egg selected lines were negative, but no relationship between these traits occurred in either the control or small-egg selected lines. There was no negative genetic correlation between egg size and fecundity. Total reproductive allocation decreased in the small-egg selected lines but did not increase in the large-egg lines. Our results have three implications. First, our selection procedure may have forced females selected for large eggs into a physiological trade-off not reflected in a negative genetic correlation between these traits. Second, the lack of a negative genetic correlation between egg size and number suggests that the phenotypic trade-off frequently observed between egg size and number in other organisms may not evolve over the short term via a direct genetic trade-off whereby increases in egg size are automatically accompanied by decreased fecundity. Finally, total reproductive allocation may not evolve independently of egg size as commonly assumed.",1999,"Lin Schwarzkopf, Mark W Blows, M Julian Caley, Lin Schwarzkopf, Mark W Blows, M Julian Caley"
Mapping of the anatomical circuit of CaM kinase-dependent courtship conditioning in Drosophila,10327242,,"Globally inhibiting CaM kinase activity in Drosophila, using a variety of genetic techniques, disrupts associative memory yet leaves visual and chemosensory perception intact. These studies implicate CaM kinase in the plastic processes underlying learning and memory but do not identify the neural circuitry that specifies the behavior. In this study, we use the GAL4/UAS binary expression system to define areas of the brain that require CaM kinase for modulation of courtship conditioning. The CaM kinase-dependent neurons that determine the response to the mated female during conditioning and those involved in formation and expression of memory were found to be located in distinct areas of the brain. This supports the idea that courtship conditioning results in two independent behavioral modifications: a decrement in courtship during the conditioning period and an associative memory of conditioning. This study has allowed us for the first time to genetically determine the circuit of information flow for a memory process in Drosophila. The map we have generated dissects the behavior into multiple components and will provide tools that allow both molecular and electrophysiological access to this circuit.",1999,"M A Joiner, L C Griffith, M A Joiner, L C Griffith"
Diverse domains of THREAD/DIAP1 are required to inhibit apoptosis induced by REAPER and HID in Drosophila,10655220,,"Significant amounts of apoptosis take place during Drosophila development. The proapoptotic genes reaper (rpr), grim, and head involution defective (hid) are required for virtually all embryonic apoptosis. The proteins encoded by these genes share a short region of homology at their amino termini. The Drosophila IAP homolog THREAD/DIAP1 (TH/DIAP1), encoded by the thread (th) gene, negatively regulates apoptosis during development. It has been proposed that RPR, GRIM, and HID induce apoptosis by binding and inactivating TH/DIAP1. The region of homology between the three proapoptotic proteins has been proposed to bind to the conserved BIR2 domain of TH/DIAP1. Here, we present an analysis of loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles of th, which indicates that additional domains of TH/DIAP1 are necessary for its ability to inhibit death induced by RPR, GRIM, and HID. In addition, that analysis of loss-of-function mutations demonstrates that th is necessary to block apoptosis very early in embryonic development. This may reflect a requirement to block maternally provided RPR and HID, or it may indicate another function of the TH/DIAP1 protein.",2000,"S Lisi, I Mazzon, K White, S Lisi, I Mazzon, K White"
Postsynaptic filopodia in muscle cells interact with innervating motoneuron axons,11017174,10.1038/79833,"Precise synaptogenesis is crucial to brain development, and depends on the ability of specific partner cells to locate and communicate with one another. Dynamic properties of axonal filopodia during synaptic targeting are well documented, but the cytomorphological dynamics of postsynaptic cells have received less attention. In Drosophila embryos, muscle cells bear numerous postsynaptic filopodia ('myopodia') during motoneuron targeting. Here we show that myopodia are actin-filled microprocesses, which progressively clustered at the site of motoneuron innervation while intermingling with presynaptic filopodia. In prospero mutants, which have severe delays in axon outgrowth from the CNS, myopodia were present initially but clustering behavior was not observed, demonstrating that clustering depends on innervating axons. Thus, postsynaptic filopodia are capable of intimate interaction with innervating presynaptic axons. We propose that, by contributing to direct long-distance cellular communication, they are dynamically involved in synaptic matchmaking.",2000,"S Ritzenthaler, E Suzuki, A Chiba, S Ritzenthaler, E Suzuki, A Chiba"

Females from three of five strains of D. sechellia accepted winged D. melanogaster less than wingless ones in no choice tests, suggesting that D. melanogaster songs reduce mating in D. sechellia females. Multiple choice tests showed that males prefer conspecifics. In female choice tests, D. melanogaster females copulated with winged heterospecific D. sechellia males more than with wingless conspecific D. melanogaster males in the confined condition, suggesting that song differences between D. melanogaster and D. sechellia affect D. melanogaster females less than the absence of courtship song.

Cellular basis of wing size variation in Drosophila melanogaster: a comparison of latitudinal clines on two continents,10762404,10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00677.x,"We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous, latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the differences between the continents were caused by differences in the initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and natural populations along latitudinal clines.",2000,"B J Zwaan, R B Azevedo, A C James, J Van 't Land, L Partridge, B J Zwaan, R B Azevedo, A C James, J Van 't Land, L Partridge"

However, the immuno-electron microscopy experiments in this study reveal that the White and Scarlet proteins are located in the membranes of pigment granules within pigment cells and retinula cells of the compound eye. No evidence of their presence in the plasma membrane was observed. This result suggests that, rather than tranporting tryptophan into the cell across the plasma membrane, the White/Scarlet complex transports a metabolic intermediate (such as 3-hydroxy kynurenine) from the cytoplasm into the pigment granules.

"Lipopolysaccharide-activated kinase, an essential component for the induction of the antimicrobial peptide genes in Drosophila melanogaster cells",10636911,10.1074/jbc.275.3.2071,"Eukaryotic organisms use a similar Rel/NF-kappaB signaling cascade for the induction of innate immune genes. In Drosophila, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal-induced activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB family transcription factors is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of inducible antimicrobial peptide genes. However, the mechanism by which the LPS-induced signaling pathway proceeds remains largely unknown. Here we have cloned a novel Drosophila LPS-activated kinase (DLAK) that is structurally related to mammalian IkappaB kinases. DLAK is expressed and transiently activated in LPS-responsive Drosophila cells following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, DLAK can interact with Cactus, a Drosophila IkappaB and phosphorylate recombinant Cactus, in vitro. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant DLAK (DLAK(K50A)) blocks LPS-induced Cactus degradation. DLAK-bound Cactus can be degraded in a LPS signal-dependent fashion, whereas the DLAK(K50A) mutant-bound Cactus is completely resistant to degradation in the presence of LPS. The DLAK(K50A) mutant also inhibits nuclear kappaB binding activity and kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, but the kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type DLAK. Moreover, mRNA analysis of various kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes shows that LPS inducibility of these genes is greatly impaired in cells overexpressing DLAK(K50A).

Exogenous expression of dCBP in muscle rescues impaired presynaptic release in the dCBP mutant background, while presynaptic dCBP expression does not. In addition, overexpression experiments indicate that elevated dCBP can also inhibit presynaptic functional development in a manner distinct from the effects of dCBP loss of function. Pre- or postsynaptic overexpression of dCBP (in wild type) reduces presynaptic release. However, we do not observe an increase in bouton number, and presynaptic overexpression impairs short-term facilitation.

The scaling of carbon dioxide release and respiratory water loss in flying fruit flies (Drosophila spp.),10769223,,"By simultaneously measuring carbon dioxide release, water loss and flight force in several species of fruit flies in the genus Drosophila, we have investigated respiration and respiratory transpiration during elevated locomotor activity. We presented tethered flying flies with moving visual stimuli in a virtual flight arena, which induced them to vary both flight force and energetic output. In response to the visual motion, the flies altered their energetic output as measured by changes in carbon dioxide release and concomitant changes in respiratory water loss. We examined the effect of absolute body size on respiration and transpiration by studying four different-sized species of fruit flies. In resting flies, body-mass-specific CO(2) release and water loss tend to decrease more rapidly with size than predicted according to simple allometric relationships. During flight, the mass-specific metabolic rate decreases with increasing body size with an allometric exponent of -0.22, which is slightly lower than the scaling exponents found in other flying insects. In contrast, the mass-specific rate of water loss appears to be proportionately greater in small animals than can be explained by a simple allometric model for spiracular transpiration. Because fractional water content does not change significantly with increasing body size, the smallest species face not only larger mass-specific energetic expenditures during flight but also a higher risk of desiccation than their larger relatives. Fruit flies lower their desiccation risk by replenishing up to 75 % of the lost bulk water by metabolic water production, which significantly lowers the risk of desiccation for animals flying under xeric environmental conditions.",2000,"F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson, J Staunton, F O Lehmann, M H Dickinson, J Staunton"

Sexual dimorphism in diverse metazoans is regulated by a novel class of intertwined zinc fingers,10898790,,"Sex determination is regulated by diverse pathways.

Here we demonstrate that the structure of the Doublesex domain contains a novel zinc module and disordered tail. The module consists of intertwined CCHC and HCCC Zn(2+)-binding sites; the tail functions as a nascent recognition alpha-helix. Mutations in either Zn(2+)-binding site or tail can lead to an intersex phenotype. The motif binds in the DNA minor groove without sharp DNA bending.

Over the past sixty years, the subject has been studied within a framework conceived by Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky and subsequently developed further by numerous other workers. In this ""isolation"" theory, the evolution of reproductive isolation is a key element of speciation; natural selection is given only secondary importance while gene flow is considered prohibitive to the process. In this paper, I argue that certain elements in this approach have produced confusion and irreconcilability among students of speciation. The more prominent debates in speciation (i.e., the species definition, sympatry/allopatry, and the role of reinforcement) all derive from an inherent conflict between the ""isolation"" theory and Darwin's ""selection"" view on species and speciation (in which disruptive selection is crucial). New data, mainly from field ecology, molecular population genetics, laboratory studies with Drosophila and computer analysis, all suggest that the isolation theory may no longer be the most desirable vantage point from which to explore speciation. Instead, environmental selection in large populations, often unimpeded by ongoing gene flow, appears to be the decisive element. The traditional preoccupation with reproductive isolation has created gaps in our knowledge of several crucial issues, mainly regarding the role of environmental selection and its connection with mate selection.",2000,"M Schilthuizen, M Schilthuizen"
Reduced X-linked nucleotide polymorphism in Drosophila simulans,10823947,10.1073/pnas.97.11.5960,"Population genetic theory predicts that selectively driven changes of allele frequency for both beneficial and deleterious mutants reduce polymorphism at tightly linked sites. All else being equal, these reductions in polymorphism are expected to be greater when recombination rates are lower. Therefore, the empirical observation of a positive correlation between recombination rates and amounts of DNA polymorphism across the Drosophila melanogaster genome can be explained by two very different types of natural selection. Here, we evaluate alternative models of effects of selection on linked sites by comparison of X-linked and autosomal variation. We present polymorphism data from 40 genes distributed across chromosome arms X and 3R of Drosophila simulans, a sibling species of D. melanogaster. We find significantly less silent polymorphism in D. simulans on the X chromosome than on 3R, but no difference between arms for silent divergence between species. This pattern is incompatible with predictions from theoretical studies on the effect of negative selection on linked sites.

This cleavage was dependent on the occurrence of an altered conformation of the tRNA substrate. We call this further cleavage hyperprocessing. In the present paper, to search for another tRNA that can be hyperprocessed in vitro, we used total mature tRNAs from Drosophila as substrates for the in vitro M1 RNA reaction. We found that some tRNAs can be hyperprocessed by M1 RNA and that two such tRNAs are an alanine tRNA and a histidine tRNA. Using mutant substrates of these tRNAs, we also show that the hyperprocessing by M1 RNA is dependent on the occurrence of altered conformations of these tRNAs. The altered conformations were very similar to that of tRNA(Met)i. We show here that M1 RNA can be used as a powerful tool to detect the alternative conformation of tRNAs. The relationship between these hyperprocessing reactions and stability of the tRNA structure will also be discussed.",2000,"Y Hori, H Baba, R Ueda, T Tanaka, Y Kikuchi, Y Hori, H Baba, R Ueda, T Tanaka, Y Kikuchi"
Modeling the molecular regulatory mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila,10649294,10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200001)22:1<84::AID-BIES13>3.0.CO;2-I,"Thanks to genetic and biochemical advances on the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila, theoretical models closely related to experimental observations can be considered for the regulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in this organism. Modeling is based on the autoregulatory negative feedback exerted by a complex between PER and TIM proteins on the expression of per and tim genes. The model predicts the occurrence of sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness. When incorporating light-induced TIM degradation, the model accounts for damping of oscillations in constant light, entrainment of the rhythm by light-dark cycles of varying period or photoperiod, and phase shifting by light pulses. The model further provides a molecular dynamical explanation for the permanent or transient suppression of circadian rhythmicity triggered in a variety of organisms by a critical pulse of light. Finally, the model shows that to produce a robust rhythm the various clock genes must be expressed at the appropriate levels since sustained oscillations only occur in a precise range of parameter values.

"Pancreatic eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha kinase (PEK) homologues in humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans that mediate translational control in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress",10677345,,"In response to different cellular stresses, a family of protein kinases regulates translation by phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2alpha). Recently, we identified a new family member, pancreatic eIF-2alpha kinase (PEK) from rat pancreas. PEK, also referred to as RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) is a transmembrane protein implicated in translational control in response to stresses that impair protein folding in the ER. In this study, we identified and characterized PEK homologues from humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of human PEK mRNA was found in over 50 different tissues examined, with highest levels in secretory tissues. In mammalian cells subjected to ER stress, we found that elevated eIF-2alpha phosphorylation was coincident with increased PEK autophosphorylation and eIF-2alpha kinase activity. Activation of PEK was abolished by deletion of PEK N-terminal sequences located in the ER lumen. To address the role of C. elegans PEK in translational control, we expressed this kinase in yeast and found that it inhibits growth by hyperphosphorylation of eIF-2alpha and inhibition of eIF-2B. Furthermore, we found that vaccinia virus K3L protein, an inhibitor of the eIF-2alpha kinase PKR involved in an anti-viral defence pathway, also reduced PEK activity. These results suggest that decreased translation initiation by PEK during ER stress may provide the cell with an opportunity to remedy the folding problem prior to introducing newly synthesized proteins into the secretory pathway.",2000,"R Sood, A C Porter, K Ma, L A Quilliam, R C Wek, R Sood, A C Porter, K Ma, L A Quilliam, R C Wek"
"Expression patterns of hairy, even-skipped, and runt in the spider Cupiennius salei imply that these genes were segmentation genes in a basal arthropod",10781054,10.1073/pnas.97.9.4515,"There is an ongoing discussion on whether segmentation in different phyla has a common origin sharing a common genetic program. However, before comparing segmentation between phyla, it is necessary to identify the ancestral condition within each phylum. Even within the arthropods it is not clear which parts of the genetic network leading to segmentation are conserved in all groups. In this paper, we analyze the expression of three segmentation genes of the pair-rule class in the spider Cupiennius salei. Spiders are representatives of the Chelicerata, a monophyletic basic arthropod group. We find that in spider embryos, the orthologues for the Drosophila primary pair-rule genes hairy, even-skipped, and runt are expressed in stripes in the growth zone, where the segments are forming, suggesting a role for these genes in chelicerate segmentation. These data imply that the involvement of hairy, even-skipped, and runt in arthropod segmentation is an ancestral character for arthropods and is not restricted to a particular group of insects.",2000,"W G Damen, M Weller, D Tautz, W G Damen, M Weller, D Tautz"
Functional conservation of Schistosoma mansoni Smads in TGF-beta signaling,11087923,10.1016/s0166-6851(00)00307-8,"To begin to understand the molecular basis of communication between the parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its mammalian host, we are studying the signaling pathway downstream of S. mansoni receptor kinase-1 (SmRK1), a divergent type I transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor found on the tegumental surface of the parasite. In this study, we have used a homology based PCR approach to clone two S. mansoni Smad (SmSmad) genes; Smads play a pivotal role in the most well understood signaling pathways initiated by the TGF-beta family of ligands in other organisms. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with those of other Smads reveals that the conserved MH1 and MH2 domains of SmSmads show a high degree of identity to homologues in Drosophila. Transcripts for both SmSmads are detected in the same developmental stages as SmRK1, and both are capable of interacting with the intracellular domain of the receptor in vitro. Functional characterization using the human type I TGF-beta receptor further confirms the highly conserved nature of these proteins, as both SmSmads show TGF-beta dependent enhancement of luciferase activity and nuclear translocation in mammalian cells. These data are the first to show a TGF-beta-like receptor/Smad signaling pathway in parasitic helminths and by analogy with other systems, is likely important in regulating schistosome development.",2000,"M J Beall, S McGonigle, E J Pearce, M J Beall, S McGonigle, E J Pearce"

A thermostable single-strand DNase from Methanococcus jannaschii related to the RecJ recombination and repair exonuclease from Escherichia coli,10633092,10.1128/jb.182.3.607-612.2000,"The RecJ protein of Escherichia coli plays an important role in a number of DNA repair and recombination pathways. RecJ catalyzes processive degradation of single-stranded DNA in a 5'-to-3' direction. Sequences highly related to those encoding RecJ can be found in most of the eubacterial genomes sequenced to date. From alignment of these sequences, seven conserved motifs are apparent. At least five of these motifs are shared among a large family of proteins in eubacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea, including the PPX1 polyphosphatase of yeast and Drosophila Prune. Archaeal genomes are particularly rich in such sequences, but it has not been clear whether any of the encoded proteins play a functional role similar to that of RecJ exonuclease. We have investigated three such proteins from Methanococcus jannaschii with the strongest overall sequence similarity to E. coli RecJ. Two of the genes, MJ0977 and MJ0831, partially complement a recJ mutant phenotype in E. coli. The expression of MJ0977 in E. coli resulted in high levels of a thermostable single-stranded DNase activity with properties similar to those of RecJ exonuclease.

Histone acetylation and gene expression analysis of sex lethal mutants in Drosophila,10835396,,"The evolution of sex determination mechanisms is often accompanied by reduction in dosage of genes on a whole chromosome. Under these circumstances, negatively acting regulatory genes would tend to double the expression of the genome, which produces compensation of the single-sex chromosome and increases autosomal gene expression. Previous work has suggested that to reduce the autosomal expression to the female level, these dosage effects are modified by a chromatin complex specific to males, which sequesters a histone acetylase to the X. The reduced autosomal histone 4 lysine 16 (H4Lys16) acetylation results in lowered autosomal expression, while the higher acetylation on the X is mitigated by the male-specific lethal complex, preventing overexpression. In this report, we examine how mutations in the principal sex determination gene, Sex lethal (Sxl), impact the H4 acetylation and gene expression on both the X and autosomes. When Sxl expression is missing in females, we find that the sequestration occurs concordantly with reductions in autosomal H4Lys16 acetylation and gene expression on the whole. When Sxl is ectopically expressed in Sxl(M) mutant males, the sequestration is disrupted, leading to an increase in autosomal H4Lys16 acetylation and overall gene expression. In both cases we find relatively little effect upon X chromosomal gene expression.",2000,"U Bhadra, M Pal-Bhadra, J A Birchler, U Bhadra, M Pal-Bhadra, J A Birchler"
A dicentric chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster showing alternate centromere inactivation,10929197,10.1007/s004120050427,"Dicentric chromosomes are rarely found, because they interfere with normal cell division causing chromosome instability.

Immunostaining with anti-Bub1 (a kinetochore-specific marker) shows that, in spite of the differences in sequence, both centromeres can be active although as a rule only one at a time. In a small fraction of the chromosomes centromere inactivation is incomplete, giving rise to true dicentric chromosomes. The centromere inactivation is clonally inherited, providing a new example of epigenetic chromosome imprinting and the possibility of genetically dissecting this process.

Adaptive evolution of a candidate gene for aging in Drosophila,10995474,10.1073/pnas.190338897,"Examination of the phenotypic effects of specific mutations has been extensively used to identify candidate genes affecting traits of interest. However, such analyses do not reveal anything about the evolutionary forces acting at these loci, or whether standing allelic variation contributes to phenotypic variance in natural populations. The Drosophila gene methuselah (mth) has been proposed as having major effects on organismal stress response and longevity phenotype. Here, we examine patterns of polymorphism and divergence at mth in population level samples of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. Mth has experienced an unusually high level of adaptive amino acid divergence concentrated in the intra- and extracellular loop domains of the receptor protein, suggesting the historical action of positive selection on those regions of the molecule that modulate signal transduction. Further analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in D. melanogaster provided evidence for contemporary and spatially variable selection at the mth locus. In ten surveyed populations, the most common mth haplotype exhibited a 40% cline in frequency that coincided with population level differences in multiple life-history traits including lifespan. This clinal pattern was not associated with any particular SNP in the coding region, indicating that selection is operating at a closely linked site that may be involved in gene expression. Together, these consistently nonneutral patterns of inter- and intraspecific variation suggest adaptive evolution of a signal transduction pathway that may modulate lifespan in nature.",2000,"P S Schmidt, D D Duvernell, W F Eanes, P S Schmidt, D D Duvernell, W F Eanes"
Pre-mRNA splicing by the essential Drosophila protein B52: tissue and target specificity,10594020,10.1128/mcb.20.1.181-186.2000,"B52, an essential SR protein of Drosophila melanogaster, stimulates pre-mRNA splicing in splicing-deficient mammalian S100 extracts.

In a homologous in vitro system, we demonstrated that B52 complements a Drosophila S100 extract to allow splicing of a Drosophila fushi tarazu (ftz) mini-pre-mRNA. Moreover, Kc cell nuclear extracts that were immunodepleted of B52 lost their ability to splice this ftz pre-mRNA. In contrast, splicing of this same ftz pre-mRNA occurred in whole larvae homozygous for the B52 deletion. Other SR protein family members isolated from these larvae could substitute for B52 splicing activity in vitro. We also observed that SR proteins are expressed variably in different larval tissues. B52 is the predominant SR protein in specific tissues, including the brain. Tissues in which B52 is normally the major SR protein, such as larval brain tissue, failed to produce ftz mRNA in the B52 deletion line. These observations support a model in which the lethality of the B52 deletion strain is a consequence of splicing defects in tissues in which B52 is normally the major SR protein.",2000,"B E Hoffman, J T Lis, B E Hoffman, J T Lis"
Function and structure of Drosophila glycans,10929001,10.1093/glycob/10.8.751,"Through the application of classic organismal genetic strategies, such as mutagenesis and interaction screens, Drosophila melanogaster provides opportunities to understand glycan function.

Other genetic and molecular approaches have demonstrated the existence of phylogenetically conserved and novel oligosaccharide processing activities and carbohydrate binding proteins. While the structural characterization of Drosophila oligosaccharide diversity has lagged behind the elucidation of glycan function, landmarks are becoming apparent in the carbohydrate terrain. For instance, O-linked GlcNAc and mucins, spatially and temporally regulated N-linked oligosaccharide expression, glycosphingolipids, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and polysialic acid have all been described. A major challenge for Drosophila glycobiology is to expand the oligosaccharide structural database while endeavoring to link glycan characterization to functional analysis. The completion of the Drosophila genome sequencing project will yield a broad portfolio of glycosyltransferases, glycan modifying enzymes and lectins requiring characterization.

Identification of SP3 as a negative regulatory transcription factor in the monocyte expression of growth hormone,10698168,10.1210/endo.141.3.7381,"A number of studies from different laboratories clearly show that cells of the immune system produce a GH molecule indistinguishable from that produced in the pituitary. A more recent finding from our studies suggests that monocytes use the same first exon and promoter sequence for the expression of lymphocyte GH as that reported for the expression of pituitary GH. In this report we have extended these results by determining that two members of the SP family of transcription factors, SP1 and SP3, bind to the region at -138/-133 bp containing a GGGAGG motif. Confirmation that this region of the monocyte GH promoter-bound SP1 and SP3 was accomplished using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with SP1 consensus and mutant probes as well as specific antibodies to SP1 and SP3. Selective mutation of the SP1/SP3 site increased basal transcription by 73%, indicating that this site is important in transcriptional inhibition. Overexpression of SP1 had no demonstrable effect on the GH promoter, whereas overexpression of SP3 caused inhibition of expression in P-388 monocyte cells. Cotransfection of P-388 cells with overexpression vectors for both SP1 and SP3 transcription factors also resulted in inhibition of basal expression. Transfection experiments in Drosophila SL-2 cells overexpressing SP1 and/or SP3 suggest that both factors repress the basal expression of GH promoter luciferase constructs and that the effect together was additive.

Functional coordination of three mitotic motors in Drosophila embryos,10637305,10.1091/mbc.11.1.241,"It is well established that multiple microtubule-based motors contribute to the formation and function of the mitotic spindle, but how the activities of these motors interrelate remains unclear. Here we visualize spindle formation in living Drosophila embryos to show that spindle pole movements are directed by a temporally coordinated balance of forces generated by three mitotic motors, cytoplasmic dynein, KLP61F, and Ncd. Specifically, our findings suggest that dynein acts to move the poles apart throughout mitosis and that this activity is augmented by KLP61F after the fenestration of the nuclear envelope, a process analogous to nuclear envelope breakdown, which occurs at the onset of prometaphase. Conversely, we find that Ncd generates forces that pull the poles together between interphase and metaphase, antagonizing the activity of both dynein and KLP61F and serving as a brake for spindle assembly. During anaphase, however, Ncd appears to have no effect on spindle pole movements, suggesting that its activity is down-regulated at this time, allowing dynein and KLP61F to drive spindle elongation during anaphase B.",2000,"D J Sharp, H M Brown, M Kwon, G C Rogers, G Holland, J M Scholey, D J Sharp, H M Brown, M Kwon, G C Rogers, G Holland, J M Scholey"

Each UAS line was then crossed to a line in which GAL4 expression was driven by one of the following promoters, eyeless (ey), glass or decapentaplegic. Thus, different kinase mutants can be ectopically expressed in a promoter-dependent manner. We observed that the ectopic expression of either the wild-type or active form of Snk driven by the glass promoter resulted in a rough-eye phenotype. Nevertheless, the ectopic expression of HsHPK under the control of the ey promoter resulted in a small-eye phenotype. The results of this study demonstrated that ectopic expression of these two mammalian genes could be achieved by the regulation of Drosophila promoters. In addition, the effects of these ectopically expressed genes on eye development could be an implication of their functions with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation.

"The orphan nuclear receptor BmHR3A of Bombyx mori: hormonal control, ovarian expression and functional properties",11335116,10.1016/s0925-4773(01)00335-5,"Ovarian development in the domesticated silkmoth, Bombyx mori, is induced by the molting hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20E) shortly after larval-pupal ecdysis. Studies of the ecdysone response in Drosophila and other insects have shown that 20E exerts its effects initially by the induction of a small number of early genes, including the orphan nuclear receptors HR3, that transduce and amplify the hormone signal. Here we show that the silkmoth orphan receptor BmHR3A acts in the 20E-induced regulatory cascade in the ovary during pupal and pharate adult development in a manner different than that observed in the classical ecdysone regulatory hierarchy in Drosophila salivary glands at the end of the third instar. While other isoforms of BmHR3 are induced as early gene products in the ecdysone response, BmHR3A is induced 2 days after 20E administration in the silkmoth ovary and, thus, behaves as late product. The period of accumulation of BmHR3A in ovarian follicular cells occurs during vitellogenesis and coincides with the period of transcriptional expression of the ESP (egg-specific protein) gene, whose product constitutes a major component of the egg yolk, while it is reciprocal to the period of expression of BmGATAbeta, a gene encoding a regulator of late chorion gene expression. Bandshift experiments demonstrate that BmHR3A binds specifically to RORE (Retinoic acid-related Orphan receptor Response Element)-like sequences in the promoters of both genes, thus suggesting a direct role for BmHR3A in regulating the expression of BmGATAbeta and ESP genes during vitellogenesis. Finally, we show that BmHR3A functions as a constitutive transcriptional activator in a B. mori derived cell line.

The initial two-to-four hsp70 duplication occurred 10--15 MYA, according to fixed in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, before the origin and divergence of the melanogaster and five other species subgroups of the melanogaster group. Analysis of more than 30 kb of flanking sequence surrounding the hsp70 gene clusters suggested that this duplication was likely a retrotransposition. For the melanogaster subgroup, Southern hybridization and an hsp70 restriction map confirmed the conserved number (4) and arrangement of hsp70 genes in the seven species other than D. melanogaster. Drosophila melanogaster is unique; tandem duplication and gene conversion at the derived cluster yielded a fifth hsp70 gene. The four D. orena hsp70 genes are highly similar and concertedly evolving. In contrast, the D. mauritiana hsp70 genes are divergent, and many alleles are nonfunctional.

Kinesins in the Arabidopsis genome: a comparative analysis among eukaryotes,11472632,10.1186/1471-2164-2-2,"Background:
        
      
      Kinesins constitute a superfamily of microtubule motor proteins that are found in eukaryotic organisms. Members of the kinesin superfamily perform many diverse cellular functions such as transport of vesicles and organelles, spindle formation and elongation, chromosome segregation, microtubule dynamics and morphogenesis. Only a few kinesins have been characterized in plants including Arabidopsis thaliana. Because of the diverse cellular functions in which kinesins are involved, the number, types and characteristics of kinesins present in the Arabidopsis genome would provide valuable information for many researchers.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Here we have analyzed the recently completed Arabidopsis genome sequence and identified sixty-one kinesin genes in the Arabidopsis genome. Among the five completed eukaryotic genomes the Arabidopsis genome has the highest percentage of kinesin genes. Further analyses of the kinesin gene products have resulted in identification of several interesting domains in Arabidopsis kinesins that provide clues in understanding their functions. A phylogenetic analysis of all Arabidopsis kinesin motor domain sequences with 113 motor domain sequences from other organisms has revealed that Arabidopsis has seven of the nine recognized subfamilies of kinesins whereas some kinesins do not fall into any known family.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      There are groups of Arabidopsis kinesins that are not present in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster that may, therefore, represent new subfamilies specific to plants.

Formation and morphology of dark puffs in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes,11525061,10.1111/j.1601-5223.2001.00015.x,"The formation of unusual dark puffs in Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes has been studied by electron microscopic (EM) analysis. Fly stocks transformed by the P[ry; Prat:bw] and P[hs-BRC-z1] constructs were used. In the former the bw gene is under the promoter of a housekeeping gene, Prat; in the latter the Br-C locus, mapping to the dark puff 2B, is under the promoter of a heat-shock gene, hsp70. Inserted into region 65A of the 3L chromosome, the Prat:bw copies give rise to structures which are morphologically reminiscent of the so-called ""dark"" puffs. In contrast, insertion of P[hs-BRC-z1] into region 99B of the 3R chromosome causes a regular ""light"" puff of form. Comparative analysis of the dark puffs--both transgenic and natural--suggests that there might be at least two mechanisms underlying their formation. One is a local incomplete decondensation of activated bands, characteristic of the so-called small puffs. The other is the formation of ectopic-looking contacts between the bands adjacent to the puffing zone. Transposition of the DNA, from which such a puff develops, causes a regular light puff to form at the new location. Heterochromatic regions do not appear to be directly involved in puffing.",2001,"V F Semeshin, V V Shloma, I F Zhimulev, V F Semeshin, V V Shloma, I F Zhimulev"
Genetic dissection of proteoglycan function in Drosophila and C. elegans,11292378,10.1006/scdb.2000.0242,"Genetic analysis of the signaling pathways that govern patterning during development in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and in the nematode C. elegans have provided insight into the in vivo functions of proteoglycans and their associated glycosaminoglycans. These studies have shown that patterning events dictated by Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors, Wnt, Transforming Growth Factor- beta(TGF- beta), and Hedgehog families of growth factors are regulated by proteoglycans. Recent biochemical and structural analyses have shown that the molecular machinery of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis is highly conserved between these invertebrate organisms and mammals.

Conservation of biotindase in mammals and identification of the putative biotinidase gene in Drosophila melanogaster,11749055,10.1006/mgme.2001.3244,"Biotinidase deficiency is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder that is characterized by the failure to recycle biotin. Many of the known mutations that cause profound biotinidase deficiency are due to missense mutations that alter amino acids that are presumably important for proper enzyme function. Amino acids essential for biotinidase activity are likely conserved in species that are dependent on biotin recycling. To gain further insight into those amino acids or regions of biotinidase that are important for enzyme activity, we examined the conservation of the amino acids in various mammalian species. The amino acid sequences of biotinidase of monkey, cow, mouse, rat, and pig from the second putative transcription start site to the stop codon of the proteins are highly conserved when compared with each other and with human enzyme, but regions upstream of the second putative transcription start site are not conserved. In addition, because the entire genome of Drosophila is now available, we have identified the putative biotinidase gene in the insect and its corresponding amino acid sequence. The same 62-amino-acid region, which includes a cysteine and is an essential part of the active site of bacterial amidases and nitrilases, is highly conserved in all the mammalian and putative Drosophila biotinidases. Many of the missense mutations that cause biotinidase deficiency are located in these conserved regions of the mammalian and Drosophila biotinidases.",2001,"K L Swango, B Wolf, K L Swango, B Wolf"

A human cDNA clone was isolated and shown to be 76% identical to Drosophila Yippee. Yippee is ubiquitously expressed in different developmental stages of Drosophila and in different fetal tissues from human.

A circadian output in Drosophila mediated by neurofibromatosis-1 and Ras/MAPK,11567138,10.1126/science.1063097,"Output from the circadian clock controls rhythmic behavior through poorly understood mechanisms. In Drosophila, null mutations of the neurofibromatosis-1 (Nf1) gene produce abnormalities of circadian rhythms in locomotor activity. Mutant flies show normal oscillations of the clock genes period (per) and timeless (tim) and of their corresponding proteins, but altered oscillations and levels of a clock-controlled reporter. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is increased in Nf1 mutants, and the circadian phenotype is rescued by loss-of-function mutations in the Ras/MAPK pathway. Thus, Nf1 signals through Ras/MAPK in Drosophila.

The protein kinase Pelle mediates feedback regulation in the Drosophila Toll signaling pathway,11731453,,"Dorsoventral polarity in the Drosophila embryo is established through a signal transduction cascade triggered in ventral and ventrolateral regions. Activation of a transmembrane receptor, Toll, leads to localized recruitment of the adaptor protein Tube and protein kinase Pelle.

Here we show through confocal immunofluorescence microscopy that Pelle functions to downregulate the signal-dependent relocalization of Tube. Inactivation of the Pelle kinase domain, or elimination of the Tube-Pelle interaction, dramatically increases Tube recruitment to the ventral plasma membrane in regions of active signaling. We also characterize a large collection of pelle alleles, identifying the molecular lesions in these alleles and their effects on Pelle autophosphorylation, Tube phosphorylation and Tube relocalization.

Addition of this agent to the medium results in an increased larval mortality of the mutants. Using a P-insertion mutagenesis screen, three MMS-sensitive mutants on chromosome II were isolated. One of these is allelic to the known EMS-induced mus205 (mutagen sensitive) mutant. In the newly isolated mutant, a P-element is detected in region 43E by in situ hybridisation. The localisation of mus205 to this region was confirmed by deficiency mapping. The gene was cloned and shows strong homology to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae REV3 gene. The REV3 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase zeta, involved in translesion synthesis. The P-element is inserted in the first exon of the mus205 gene resulting in an aberrant mRNA, encoding a putative truncated protein containing only the first 13 of the 2130 aa native Drosophila protein. The mus205 mutant is hypersensitive to alkylating agents and UV, but not to ionising radiation. In contrast to reported data, in germ cells, the mutant has no effect on mutability by X-rays, NQO and alkylating agents. In somatic cells, the mutant shows no effect on MMS-induced mutations and recombinations.

Recruitment of the male-specific lethal (MSL) dosage compensation complex to an autosomally integrated roX chromatin entry site correlates with an increased expression of an adjacent reporter gene in male Drosophila,11402038,10.1074/jbc.M103008200,"Drosophila dosage compensate (equalize X-linked gene products) by doubling the transcription of most X-linked genes in males. The MSL (male-specific lethal) ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of at least five proteins and two non-coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2) is essential for this transcription response. Recently it has been shown that the X-linked roX1 and roX2 genes each contain at least one chromatin entry site for the MSL complex. In this study we show that insertion of either roX1 or roX2 DNA sequences, upstream of an insulated lacZ reporter gene controlled with the constitutive armadillo promoter (arm-lacZ), results in a significant elevation of expression of lacZ in males. However, full compensation, that is a precise doubling of lacZ expression in males relative to females, was only observed in some lines carrying autosomal insertions of either roX1-arm-lacZ or roX2-arm-lacZ transgenes. Furthermore, we found that a 419-base pair fragment of roX1 that contains an MSL binding site was sufficient to cause a modest elevation of expression of lacZ in males, but this response was significantly less than obtained with a full-length roX1 cDNA. This is the first direct demonstration that insertion of an MSL chromatin entry site on an autosome results in elevated expression in males of genes near the entry site.",2001,"R A Henry, B Tews, X Li, M J Scott, R A Henry, B Tews, X Li, M J Scott"

Differential distribution of simple sequence repeats in eukaryotic genome sequences,11420357,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003903,"Complete chromosome/genome sequences available from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed for the occurrence of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats. In all of the genomes studied, dinucleotide repeat stretches tended to be longer than other repeats. Additionally, tetranucleotide repeats in humans and trinucleotide repeats in Drosophila also seemed to be longer. Although the trends for different repeats are similar between different chromosomes within a genome, the density of repeats may vary between different chromosomes of the same species. The abundance or rarity of various di- and trinucleotide repeats in different genomes cannot be explained by nucleotide composition of a sequence or potential of repeated motifs to form alternative DNA structures. This suggests that in addition to nucleotide composition of repeat motifs, characteristic DNA replication/repair/recombination machinery might play an important role in the genesis of repeats. Moreover, analysis of complete genome coding DNA sequences of Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast indicated that expansions of codon repeats corresponding to small hydrophilic amino acids are tolerated more, while strong selection pressures probably eliminate codon repeats encoding hydrophobic and basic amino acids. The locations and sequences of all of the repeat loci detected in genome sequences and coding DNA sequences are available at http://www.ncl-india.org/ssr and could be useful for further studies.",2001,"M V Katti, P K Ranjekar, V S Gupta, M V Katti, P K Ranjekar, V S Gupta"

Mot1 N-terminal deletions (residues 25-801) abolished TBP binding, whereas C-terminal ATPase domain deletions (residues 802-1867) did not. Complex formation was prevented above 200 mm salt, consistent with electrostatic interaction. Correspondingly, TBP variants lacking solvent-exposed positive charge did not bind Mot1, whereas a mutant lacking positive charge within the DNA-binding groove bound Mot1. ATPase-defective mutant, Mot1(D1408N), which inhibits growth when overexpressed (but is suppressed by co-overexpression of TBP), bound TBP normally in vitro, suggesting it forms nonrecyclable complexes. N-terminal deletions of Mot1(D1408N) were not growth-inhibitory. C-terminal deletions were toxic when overexpressed, and toxicity was ameliorated by TBP co-overproduction. Residues 1-800 of Mot1 are therefore necessary and sufficient for TBP binding. The N terminus of 89B, a tissue-specific Drosophila Mot1 homolog, bound the TBP-like factor, dTRF1.

In animals, model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mice have shown a general cell death profile of induction, caspase mediation, cell death, and phagocytosis.

The ordering of the C. elegans genes Ced-3, 4 and 9, identification of caspase-activated DNase that degrades nuclear DNA during PCD, identification of signal transduction modules involving caspases as well as the caspase-independent pathway, and the involvement of mitochondria are some of the findings of immense value in understanding animal PCDs. Similarly, the caspase inactivation mechanisms of infecting viruses to stall host cell death give a new dimension to the viral infection process. However, plant cell death profiles provide an entirely different scenario. The presence of a cell wall that cannot be phagocytosed, absence of the hallmarks of animal PCDs such as DNA laddering, formation of apoptotic bodies, a cell-death-specific nuclease, a biochemical machinery of killer enzymes such as caspases all point to novel ways of cell elimination.

Furthermore, the melanic mutants niger of C. capitata and ebony(4) of D. melanogaster, known to be defective for NBAD synthase, were also unable to synthesize NBANE. The protein preparation acylated tyrosine with much less efficiency, to produce sarcophagine (beta-alanyltyrosine). Strikingly, extracts from the melanic mutants were unable to synthesize sarcophagine.

DNA double-strand break-induced phosphorylation of Drosophila histone variant H2Av helps prevent radiation-induced apoptosis,12202754,10.1093/nar/gkf496,"The response of eukaryotic cells to the formation of a double-strand break (DSB) in chromosomal DNA is highly conserved. One of the earliest responses to DSB formation is phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of H2A histones located in nucleosomes near the break. Histone variant H2AX and core histone H2A are phosphorylated in mammals and budding yeast, respectively. We demonstrate the DSB-induced phosphorylation of histone variant H2Av in Drosophila melanogaster. H2Av is a member of the H2AZ family of histone variants. Ser137 within an SQ motif located near the C- terminus of H2Av was phosphorylated in response to gamma-irradiation in both tissue culture cells and larvae. Phosphorylation was detected within 1 min of irradiation and detectable after only 0.3 Gy of radiation exposure. Photochemically induced DSBs, but not general oxidative damage or UV-induced nicking of DNA, caused H2Av phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation is DSB specific. Imaginal disc cells from Drosophila expressing a mutant allele of H2Av with its C-terminal tail deleted, and therefore unable to be phosphorylated, were more sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis than were wildtype controls, suggesting that phosphorylation of H2Av is important for repair of radiation-induced DSBs. These observations suggest that in addition to providing the function of an H2AZ histone, H2Av is also the functional homolog in Drosophila of H2AX.",2002,"James P Madigan, Heather L Chotkowski, Robert L Glaser, James P Madigan, Heather L Chotkowski, Robert L Glaser"
Interactions of the Mcm1 MADS box protein with cofactors that regulate mating in yeast,12052870,10.1128/mcb.22.13.4607-4621.2002,"The yeast Mcm1 protein is a member of the MADS box family of transcriptional regulatory factors, a class of DNA-binding proteins that control numerous cellular and developmental processes in yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, plants, and mammals. Although these proteins bind DNA on their own, they often combine with different cofactors to bind with increased affinity and specificity to their target sites. To understand how this class of proteins functions, we have made a series of alanine substitutions in the MADS box domain of Mcm1 and examined the effects of these mutations in combination with its cofactors that regulate mating in yeast. Our results indicate which residues of Mcm1 are essential for viability and transcriptional regulation with its cofactors in vivo. Most of the mutations in Mcm1 that are lethal affect DNA-binding affinity. Interestingly, the lethality of many of these mutations can be suppressed if the MCM1 gene is expressed from a high-copy-number plasmid. Although many of the alanine substitutions affect the ability of Mcm1 to activate transcription alone or in combination with the alpha 1 and Ste12 cofactors, most mutations have little or no effect on Mcm1-mediated repression in combination with the alpha 2 cofactor. Even nonconservative amino acid substitutions of residues in Mcm1 that directly contact alpha 2 do not significantly affect repression. These results suggest that within the same region of the Mcm1 MADS box domain, there are different requirements for interaction with alpha 2 than for interaction with either alpha1 or Ste12. Our results suggest how a small domain, the MADS box, interacts with multiple cofactors to achieve specificity in transcriptional regulation and how subtle differences in the sequences of different MADS box proteins can influence the interactions with specific cofactors while not affecting the interactions with common cofactors.",2002,"Janet Mead, Adrian R Bruning, Michael K Gill, Andrew M Steiner, Thomas B Acton, Andrew K Vershon, Janet Mead, Adrian R Bruning, Michael K Gill, Andrew M Steiner, Thomas B Acton, Andrew K Vershon"
Does heterochromatin protein 1 always follow code?,12151603,10.1073/pnas.162371699,"Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) is a conserved chromosomal protein that participates in chromatin packaging and gene silencing. A loss of HP1 leads to lethality in Drosophila and correlates with metastasis in human breast cancer cells. On Drosophila polytene chromosomes HP1 is localized to centric regions, telomeric regions, in a banded pattern along the fourth chromosome, and at many sites scattered throughout the euchromatic arms. Recently, one mechanism of HP1 chromosome association was revealed; the amino-terminal chromo domain of HP1 interacts with methylated lysine nine of histone H3, consistent with the histone code hypothesis. Compelling data support this mechanism of HP1 association at centric regions. Is this the only mechanism by which HP1 associates with chromosomes? Interest is now shifting toward the role of HP1 within euchromatic domains. Accumulating evidence in Drosophila and mammals suggests that HP1 associates with chromosomes through interactions with nonhistone chromosomal proteins at locations other than centric heterochromatin. Does HP1 play a similar role in chromatin packaging and gene regulation at these sites as it does in centric heterochromatin? Does HP1 associate with the same proteins at these sites as it does in centric heterochromatin? A first step toward answering these questions is the identification of sequences associated with HP1 within euchromatic domains. Such sequences are likely to include HP1 ""target genes"" whose discovery will aid in our understanding of HP1 lethality in Drosophila and metastasis of breast cancer cells.",2002,"Yuhong Li, Dawn A Kirschmann, Lori L Wallrath, Yuhong Li, Dawn A Kirschmann, Lori L Wallrath"
Nutrient control of gene expression in Drosophila: microarray analysis of starvation and sugar-dependent response,12426388,10.1093/emboj/cdf600,"We have identified genes regulated by starvation and sugar signals in Drosophila larvae using whole-genome microarrays. Based on expression profiles in the two nutrient conditions, they were organized into different categories that reflect distinct physiological pathways mediating sugar and fat metabolism, and cell growth. In the category of genes regulated in sugar-fed, but not in starved, animals, there is an upregulation of genes encoding key enzymes of the fat biosynthesis pathway and a downregulation of genes encoding lipases. The highest and earliest activated gene upon sugar ingestion is sugarbabe, a zinc finger protein that is induced in the gut and the fat body. Identification of potential targets using microarrays suggests that sugarbabe functions to repress genes involved in dietary fat breakdown and absorption.

"Underexpression of Gcm2, a master regulatory gene of parathyroid gland development, in adenomas of primary hyperparathyroidism",12354132,10.1046/j.1365-2265.2002.01627.x,"Objective:
        
      
      Glial cells missing (Gcm) was first identified as a binary switch between neuronal and glial determination in Drosophila. Two homologues of Drosophila Gcm have been identified in mice and humans, namely Gcm1 and Gcm2. Mouse Gcm2 is restricted to parathyroid tissues and Gcm2 was recently identified as a master regulatory gene of parathyroid gland development as Gcm2 knockout mice lack parathyroid glands.
    


          Design/patients:
        
      
      To identify Gcm2 transcripts in human non-neural tissues and to examine whether Gcm2 is involved in parathyroid gland tumorigenesis we analysed Gcm2 transcript levels in several non-neural tissues by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and performed real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis on five normal glands, 15 parathyroid adenomas of primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) and nine hyperplastic glands of secondary HPT.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We found high Gcm2 mRNA expression in human parathyroid glands in comparison with other non-neural tissues and underexpression in parathyroid adenomas but not in lesions of HPT secondary to uraemia.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Because adenomas demonstrate lower Gcm2 expression than normal glands we suggest that reduced expression of Gcm2 contributes to parathyroid gland tumorigenesis. We speculate that a proper expression level of the Gcm2 transcription factor could be important for maintaining a fully differentiated state of the parathyroid cell.",2002,"Pamela Correa, Göran Akerström, Gunnar Westin, Pamela Correa, Göran Akerström, Gunnar Westin"

We addressed the question of whether this heterodimer, like all other RXR heterodimers, may be formed in the absence of ligand and whether ligand promotes dimerization. We found that C-terminal protein fragments that comprised the ligand binding, but not the DNA binding domain of EcR and USP and which were equipped with the activation or DNA binding region of GAL4, respectively, exhibit a weak ability to interact spontaneously with each other. Moreover, the heterodimer formation is greatly enhanced upon administration of active ecdysteroids in a dose-dependent manner. This was shown in vivo by a yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro by a modified electromobility shift assay. Furthermore, the EcR fragment expressed in yeast was functional and bound radioactively labelled ecdysteroid specifically. Ligand binding was greatly enhanced by the presence of a USP ligand binding domain.

Mor2 is important for the localization of F-actin at the cell end(s) but not at the medial region, and is essential for the restriction of the growth zone(s) where Tip1 targets. Mor2 is homologous to the Drosophila Furry protein, which is required to maintain the integrity of cellular extensions, and is localized at both cell ends and the medial region of the cell in an actin-dependent fashion. Cellular localization of Mor2 and Orb6 was interdependent. The tyrosine kinase Wee1 is necessary for the G(2) delay and maintenance of viability of the mor2 mutant.

Genomewide analysis of the Drosophila tetraspanins reveals a subset with similar function in the formation of the embryonic synapse,12370414,10.1073/pnas.212511099,"Tetraspanins encode a large conserved family of proteins that span the membrane four times and are expressed in a variety of eukaryotic tissues. They are part of membrane complexes that are involved in such diverse processes as intracellular signaling, cellular motility, metastasis, and tumor suppression. The single fly tetraspanin characterized to date, late bloomer (lbm), is expressed on the axons, terminal arbors, and growth cones of motoneurons. In embryos lacking Lbm protein, motoneurons reach their muscle targets, but initially fail to form synaptic terminals. During larval stages, however, functional contacts are formed. The newly available genomic sequence of Drosophila melanogaster indicates the existence of 34 additional members of the tetraspanin family in the fly. To address the possibility that other tetraspanins with functions that might compensate for a lack of lbm exist, we determined the expression domains of the Drosophila tetraspanin gene family members by RNA in situ analysis. We found two other tetraspanins also expressed in motoneurons and subsequently generated a small chromosomal deletion that removes all three motoneuron-specific tetraspanins. The deletion results in a significant enhancement in the lbm phenotype, indicating that the two additional motoneuron-expressed tetraspanins can, at least in part, compensate for the absence of lbm during the formation of the embryonic synapse.",2002,"Lee G Fradkin, Jessica T Kamphorst, Aaron DiAntonio, Corey S Goodman, Jasprina N Noordermeer, Lee G Fradkin, Jessica T Kamphorst, Aaron DiAntonio, Corey S Goodman, Jasprina N Noordermeer"

To investigate whether co-expressed genes are clustered, we examined the chromosomal positions of the genes expressed in the muscle of Caenorhabditis elegans at the first larval stage. Here we show that co-expressed genes in C. elegans are clustered in groups of 2-5 along the chromosomes, suggesting that expression from a chromatin domain can extend over several genes.

TLR4-dependent lipopolysaccharide signalling in epithelial cells is independent of extracellular protease activity,12027957,10.1046/j.1462-5822.2002.00190.x,"Epithelial cells are the first cells that encounter infecting bacteria and, as such, they have developed several mechanisms for microbial protection. We have shown previously that bladder epithelial cells express the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 that enables a rapid cellular interleukin (IL)-8 response when exposed to Escherichia coli and LPS. TLR4 belongs to a family of receptors that was initially identified in Drosophila, in which Toll is required for the immune response against fungi. Fungal exposure activates a series of serine proteases that process the protein Spaetzle to a cytokine-like form that acts as a ligand for Toll. Here, we investigated whether a similar proteolytic cascade is required for human TLR activation. When screening a set of 18 protease inhibitors, three serine protease inhibitors (TPCK, TLCK and Pefabloc) were shown to inhibit LPS- and peptidoglycan-induced IL-8 production in TLR2- and TLR4-positive bladder epithelial cells. However, they were equally effective inhibitors of IL-1beta-induced signalling, indicating that their target(s) is/are located downstream of the TLRs. Further characterization showed that these inhibitors blocked I kappa B degradation but not phosphorylation in LPS-stimulated cells, which suggests that the serine protease inhibitors target the 26S proteasome. Identical results were obtained on LPS-stimulated monocytes.

The cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors have interdependent roles in patterning the Drosophila oocyte,12477386,10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01303-9,"Background:
        
      
      Motor proteins of the minus end-directed cytoplasmic dynein and plus end-directed kinesin families provide the principal means for microtubule-based transport in eukaryotic cells. Despite their opposing polarity, these two classes of motors may cooperate in vivo. In Drosophila circumstantial evidence suggests that dynein acts in the localization of determinants and signaling factors during oogenesis. However, the pleiotropic requirement for dynein throughout development has made it difficult to establish its specific role.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We analyzed dynein function in the oocyte by disrupting motor activity through temporally restricted expression of the dynactin subunit, dynamitin. Our results indicate that dynein is required for several processes that impact patterning; such processes include localization of bicoid (bcd) and gurken (grk) mRNAs and anchoring of the oocyte nucleus to the cell cortex. Surprisingly, dynein function is sensitive to reduction in kinesin levels, and germ line clones lacking kinesin show defects in dorsal follicle cell fate, grk mRNA localization, and nuclear attachment that are similar to those resulting from the loss of dynein. Significantly, dynein and dynactin localization is perturbed in these animals. Conversely, kinesin localization also depends on dynein activity.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      We demonstrate that dynein is required for nuclear anchoring and localization of cellular determinants during oogenesis. Strikingly, mutations in the kinesin motor also disrupt these processes and perturb dynein and dynactin localization. These results indicate that the activity of the two motors is interdependent and suggest a model in which kinesin affects patterning indirectly through its role in the localization and recycling of dynein.",2002,"Jason E Duncan, Rahul Warrior, Jason E Duncan, Rahul Warrior"

Nucleotide variation of the duplicated amylase genes in Drosophila kikkawai,11961101,10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004126,"We examined levels and patterns of the nucleotide polymorphism of the Amylase genes with a head-to-head duplication in Drosophila kikkawai. The levels of variation in D. kikkawai were comparable to those in Drosophila melanogaster. Tajima's test, Fu and Li's test, HKA test, and MK test did not show significant departure from neutrality. We found an excess of replacement changes in the within-locus class, representing polymorphism in one of the duplicated genes, compared with the between-locus class, representing polymorphism shared between the duplicated genes. Most replacement changes in the within-locus class were singletons. These results suggest that most replacement changes are deleterious. A contrasting evolutionary pattern, involving concerted evolution in the coding regions but differential evolution in the 5'-flanking regions, was observed. However, unlike the duplicated Amy genes of D. melanogaster, the coding regions of the duplicated genes in D. kikkawai tended to diverge. Using Ohta's model of the small multigene family, we found that recombination (interchromosomal equal crossing-over) rate was one order higher than gene conversion (unequal crossing-over) rate, resulting in a considerable but incomplete homogenization of the duplicated coding regions.

Somatic recombination: a major genotoxic effect of two pyrimidine antimetabolitic chemotherapeutic drugs in Drosophila melanogaster,11815248,10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00326-6,"Two deoxycytidine analogues, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside, citarabine, araC) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine, DAC, 5-aza-dC), are the drugs of choice in the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. The araC-induced cytotoxicity is a direct result of its interference with nucleic acids synthesis, whereas 5-aza-dC is a potent suppressor of DNA methylation. We employed the standard version of the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the genotoxic potential of these two antimetabolites as a function of exposure concentration. In addition, we determined the relative contributions of mutational and recombinational events to total genotoxicity. The compounds were administered by chronic feeding of 3-day-old larvae. Our results indicate that recombinagenicity is the major genotoxic effect of araC and 5-aza-dC (approximately, 77 and 81%, respectively, recombination). The standardised clone induction frequencies (per mM concentration per cell per cell division) show that 5-aza-dC is 85 times more powerful then araC (inducing approximately 58 mutant clones per 10(5) cells per mM). The high recombinagenic activity of these two drugs suggests that--despite their therapeutic effects against cancer--a question is raised whether these drugs should be considered for adverse effects in cancer chemotherapy.",2002,"Kênya Silva Cunha, Maria Luíza Reguly, Ulrich Graf, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade, Kênya Silva Cunha, Maria Luíza Reguly, Ulrich Graf, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade"
Clinal variation in Drosophila serrata for stress resistance and body size,12073552,10.1017/s0016672301005523,"Clines for size and stress resistance traits have been described for several Drosophila species and replicable clines across different species may indicate climatic selection. Here we consider clines in stress resistance traits in an Australian endemic species, D. serrata, by comparing levels of variation within and among isofemale lines initiated with flies collected from the eastern coast of Australia. We also consider clinical variation in chill coma recovery, a trait that has recently been shown to exhibit high levels of variation among Drosophila species. Patterns were compared with those in the cosmopolitan species D. melanogaster from the same area. Both desiccation and starvation resistance showed no clinical pattern despite heritable variation among isofemale lines. In contrast chill coma resistance exhibited a linear cline in the anticipated direction, resistance increasing with latitude. Body size was measured as wing length and body weight. Both traits showed geographic variation and strong non-linear clines with a sharp reduction in size in the tropics.

Localization of the tandem pore domain K+ channel KCNK5 (TASK-2) in the rat central nervous system,11834308,10.1016/s0169-328x(01)00330-8,"Tandem pore domain K+ channels (2P K+ channels) are responsible for background K+ currents. 2P K+ channels are the most numerous encoded K+ channels in the Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster genomes and to date 14 human 2P K+ channels have been identified. The 2P K+ channel TASK-2 (also named KCNK5) is sensitive to changes in extracellular pH, inhibited by local anesthetics and activated by volatile anesthetics. While TASK-1 has been shown to be involved in controlling neuronal cell excitability, much less is known about the cellular expression and function of TASK-2, originally cloned from human kidney. Previous studies demonstrated TASK-2 mRNA expression in high abundance in human kidney, liver, and pancreas, but only low expression in mouse brain or even absent expression in human brain was reported. In this study we have used immunohistochemical methods to localize TASK-2 at the cellular level in the rat central nervous system. TASK-2 immunoreactivity is prominently found in the rat hippocampal formation with the strongest staining observed in the pyramidal cell layer and in the dentate gyrus, and the Purkinje and granule cells of cerebellum. Additional immunofluorescence studies in cultured cerebellar granule cells demonstrate TASK-2 localization to the neuronal soma and to the proximal regions of neurites of cerebellar granule cells. The superficial layers of spinal cord and small-diameter neurons of dorsal root ganglia also showed strong TASK-2 immunoreactivity. These results suggest a possible involvement of TASK-2 in central mechanisms for controlling cell excitability and in peripheral signal transduction.",2002,"Anja Gabriel, Mona Abdallah, C Spencer Yost, Bruce D Winegar, Christoph H Kindler, Anja Gabriel, Mona Abdallah, C Spencer Yost, Bruce D Winegar, Christoph H Kindler"
Molecular cloning and developmental expression of Par-1/MARK homologues XPar-1A and XPar-1B from Xenopus laevis,14516676,10.1016/s0925-4773(03)00107-2,"Par-1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is involved in asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila embryos. Recent biochemical studies indicate an association of PAR-1 with the Dishevelled protein and suggest a role in so-called canonical Wnt signaling (Nat. Cell Biol. 3 (2001) 628). Here we describe two Xenopus laevis cDNAs, which encode PAR-1 homologues designated XPar-1A and XPar-1B. Structurally, XPar-1A and XPar-1B are closely related to rat MARK proteins and human Par-1A and Par-1Balpha, respectively. XPar-1A and XPar-1B are expressed both maternally and zygotically in an indistinguishable pattern. In the egg and cleavage stage embryos their transcripts are enriched in the animal pole of the embryo. During blastula and gastrula stages, cells in the animal and marginal regions continue to express both genes uniformly. Expression progresses vegetally towards and then through the blastopore lip concomitantly with the movements of epiboly and gastrulation. With the onset of neurulation, XPar-1A and XPar-1B transcripts are restricted to the neurectoderm. At tailbud and tadpole stages they are detected in the head region, including brain, eyes, otic vesicles, cement gland, branchial arches as well as spinal cord and somites. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the Xenopus par-1 homologues XPar-1A and XPar-1B are expressed in frog embryos both maternally and zygotically in a restricted pattern and may play a role in establishing polarity in early embryos as well as in organogenesis during later stages of development.",2002,"Olga Ossipova, Xi He, Jeremy Green, Olga Ossipova, Xi He, Jeremy Green"

Although migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), under denaturing conditions, was unusually slow, molecular weight determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed that the product was consistent with its theoretical size. Gel filtration chromatography yielded an anomalously large Stokes radius, suggesting a fully unfolded conformation. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrated that Gli-cyt was >50% unfolded, further suggesting a nonglobular conformation. Finally, 1D-(1)H NMR conclusively demonstrated that Gli-cyt possesses an extended unfolded structure.

Using D. simulans synthetic lines with compound chromosomes from a population of the Seychelles Islands (high frequency of interspecific mating) and a multimarker strain (low frequency), we show that D. simulans males play an important role in discriminating D. melanogaster females. The genetics of male discrimination fits well with the inheritance mode of a single locus, dominant for sexual isolation, located in chromosome II near the net mutation (2L-0.0). The heterospecific mating success of the male was not related to his sexual vigor.

Calcium-dependent and aspartyl proteases in neurodegeneration and ageing in C. elegans,14522246,10.1016/s1568-1637(03)00032-1,"Proteolytic mechanisms have been implicated in the process of ageing, and in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, which are most prevalent in old age. Simple model organisms such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which offer the prowess of sophisticated genetic approaches, have contributed to our understanding of ageing and neurodegeneration. Intensive research in these systems has resulted in detailed models of the ageing process, and also of several neurodegenerative diseases, which recapitulate same aspects of the human pathologies. Inappropriate cell death is a major component of these and other devastating conditions such as stroke. The dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of cell degeneration in ageing is of utmost importance. Evidence from investigations in C. elegans implicates deregulated proteolysis as one major determinant of cellular destruction in neurodegeneration and ageing, and suggests that the process depends critically on the activation of calcium-dependent, calpain proteases and lysosomal aspartyl proteases. Apart from shedding light on important but inadequately understood facets of such phenomena, these discoveries hold promise for developing novel, effective intervention strategies aiming to ameliorate or even counter inappropriate cell death.",2003,"Chrysanthi Samara, Nektarios Tavernarakis, Chrysanthi Samara, Nektarios Tavernarakis"

Analysis of the biology of stem cells and their regulatory microenvironment in adult organs has, however, been hindered by the rarity of these cells in mature tissues and by the lack of positive markers for them. The ovary of the Drosophila melanogaster female is a stem cell niche in which such analyses can be performed. The stromal cells of the microenvironment act as a regulatory centre to control the proliferation and differentiation of the germline stem cells, using several signalling molecules, among them the protein DPP - a Drosophila homologue of the human bone morphogenetic proteins BMP2 and BMP4.

"The effects of host age, host nuclear background and temperature on phenotypic effects of the virulent Wolbachia strain popcorn in Drosophila melanogaster",12871912,,"Because of their obligate endosymbiotic nature, Wolbachia strains by necessity are defined by their phenotypic effects upon their host. Nevertheless, studies on the influence of host background and environmental conditions upon the manifestation of Wolbachia effects are relatively uncommon. Here we examine the behavior of the overreplicating Wolbachia strain popcorn in four different Drosophila melanogaster backgrounds at two temperatures. Unlike other strains of Wolbachia in Drosophila, popcorn has a major fitness impact upon its hosts. The rapid proliferation of popcorn causes cells to rupture, resulting in the premature death of adult hosts. Apart from this effect, we found that popcorn delayed development time, and host background influenced both this trait and the rate of mortality associated with infection. Temperature influenced the impact of popcorn upon host mortality, with no reduction in life span occurring in flies reared at 19 degrees. No effect upon fecundity was found. Contrary to earlier reports, popcorn induced high levels of incompatibility when young males were used in tests, and CI levels declined rapidly with male age. The population dynamics of popcorn-type infections will therefore depend on environmental temperature, host background, and the age structure of the population.",2003,"K Tracy Reynolds, Linda J Thomson, Ary A Hoffmann, K Tracy Reynolds, Linda J Thomson, Ary A Hoffmann"
RNA-mediated neurodegeneration caused by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats in Drosophila,12948442,10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00533-6,"Fragile X syndrome carriers have FMR1 alleles, called premutations, with an intermediate number of 5' untranslated CGG repeats between patients (>200 repeats) and normal individuals (<60 repeats). A novel neurodegenerative disease has recently been appreciated in some premutation carriers. As no neurodegeneration is seen in fragile X patients, who do not express FMR1, we hypothesize that lengthened rCGG repeats of the premutation transcript may lead to neurodegeneration. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, we show that 90 rCGG repeats alone are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. This phenotype is neuron specific and rCGG repeat dosage sensitive. Although devoid of mutant protein, this neurodegeneration exhibits neuronal inclusion bodies that are Hsp70 and ubiquitin positive. Overexpression of Hsp70 could suppress the neurodegeneration. These results demonstrate that neurodegenerative phenotype associated with fragile X premutation is indeed caused by the lengthened rCGG repeats and provide the first in vivo experimental demonstration of RNA-mediated neurodegeneration.",2003,"Peng Jin, Daniela C Zarnescu, Fuping Zhang, Christopher E Pearson, John C Lucchesi, Kevin Moses, Stephen T Warren, Peng Jin, Daniela C Zarnescu, Fuping Zhang, Christopher E Pearson, John C Lucchesi, Kevin Moses, Stephen T Warren"

In this study we describe experiments to determine how different enhancers respond to Bcd distinctively, focusing on two natural Bcd-responsive enhancer elements, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni). Our results show that, on the hb enhancer element, the amino-terminal domain of Bcd (residues 1 to 91) plays primarily an inhibitory role, whereas on the kni enhancer element this same Bcd domain plays a positive role at low protein concentrations. We further demonstrate that while the amino-terminal domain is largely dispensable for cooperative binding to the hb enhancer element, it is preferentially required for cooperative binding to the kni enhancer element. Alteration of the arrangement of Bcd binding sites in the kni enhancer element reduces the role of the amino-terminal domain in cooperative DNA binding but increases the effectiveness of the self-inhibitory function. In addition, elimination of symmetric pairs of Bcd binding sites in the kni enhancer element reduces both DNA binding and activation by Bcd. We propose that the amino-terminal domain of Bcd is an enhancer-specific switch that contributes to the protein's ability to activate different target genes in distinct manners.",2003,"Dechen Fu, Chen Zhao, Jun Ma, Dechen Fu, Chen Zhao, Jun Ma"
In vivo calcium imaging of brain activity in Drosophila by transgenic cameleon expression,12644713,10.1126/stke.2003.174.pl6,"Various genetically encoded fluorescent sensors that monitor changes in intracellular calcium concentration have been developed over the last few years.

However, using cameleons to image intracellular calcium concentration changes in vivo is still evolving and is by no means a standard technique. Experimental details and ""tricks"" for dealing with equipment, techniques, and data evaluation are still restricted to a few laboratories.

Homothorax switches function of Drosophila photoreceptors from color to polarized light sensors,14636555,10.1016/s0092-8674(03)00848-1,"Different classes of photoreceptors (PRs) allow animals to perceive various types of visual information.

In addition, flies use a specialized class of inner PRs in the ""dorsal rim area"" of the eye (DRA) to detect the e-vector of polarized light, allowing them to exploit skylight polarization for orientation. We show that homothorax is both necessary and sufficient for inner PRs to adopt the polarization-sensitive DRA fate instead of the color-sensitive default state. Homothorax increases rhabdomere size and uncouples R7-R8 communication to allow both cells to express the same opsin rather than different ones as required for color vision.

Dendrites of distinct classes of Drosophila sensory neurons show different capacities for homotypic repulsion,12699617,10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00207-0,"Background:
        
      
      Understanding how dendrites establish their territory is central to elucidating how neuronal circuits are built. Signaling between dendrites is thought to be important for defining their territories; however, the strategies by which different types of dendrites communicate are poorly understood. We have shown previously that two classes of Drosophila peripheral da sensory neurons, the class III and class IV neurons, provide complete and independent tiling of the body wall. By contrast, dendrites of class I and class II neurons do not completely tile the body wall, but they nevertheless occupy nonoverlapping territories.
    


          Results:
        
      
      By developing reagents to permit high-resolution studies of dendritic tiling in living animals, we demonstrate that isoneuronal and heteroneuronal class IV dendrites engage in persistent repulsive interactions. In contrast to the extensive dendritic exclusion shown by class IV neurons, duplicated class III neurons showed repulsion only at their dendritic terminals. Supernumerary class I and class II neurons innervated completely overlapping regions of the body wall, and this finding suggests a lack of like-repels-like behavior.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These data suggest that repulsive interactions operate between morphologically alike dendritic arbors in Drosophila.

Early programming of adult longevity: demographic and experimental studies,12941179,10.1089/109454503765361542,"It is supposed that longevity might be programmed by early life exposures.

In demographic study, the recorded deaths in Kiev (Ukraine) between 1990 and 2000 (51,503 men and 50,131 women) were used. Age at death was strongly associated with month of birth. Subjects born in the middle of year (April-July) had the lowest longevity. Increasing longevity was observed with each successive birth-month in the second half of the year, with a peak longevity for births in December. To research of the mechanisms responsible for longevity programming, study of adult D. melanogaster DNA repair capacity after irradiation at the egg stage was carried out, using marker such as DNA strand breaks. Insects irradiated in low doses (0.50 and 0.75 Gy) had extended life span and increased stability to S1 nuclease treatment. The probable explanation of observed postponed effects might be the long-term modulation of certain (possibly repair) genes activity. We hypothesize that life-extending effects of different anti-aging treatments might be a consequence of their unspecific (hormetic) action, rather then specific (geroprotector) action on the some aging-related processes, and induction an ""transcriptional reprogramming"" may be a key mechanism of the longevity programming and artificial life extension.",2003,"Alexander M Vaiserman, Vladimir P Voitenko, Alexander M Vaiserman, Vladimir P Voitenko"

Immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Staufen1 (Stau1) and Staufen2 (Stau2) accumulate preferentially within the postsynaptic sarcoplasm of muscle fibers as well as at newly formed ectopic synapses. Western blot analyses showed that the levels of Stau1 and Stau2 are greater in slow muscles than in fast-twitch muscles. Muscle denervation induced a significant increase in the expression of Stau1 and Stau2 in the extrasynaptic compartment of both fast and slow muscles. Consistent with these observations, we also demonstrated that expression of Stau1 and Stau2 is increased during myogenic differentiation and that treatment of myotubes with agrin and neuregulin induces a further increase in the expression of both Staufen proteins.

They do not encode glutathione peroxidases or glutathione reductases, and their thioredoxin reductases exhibit distinct properties from those of higher and lower species. Nonetheless, appropriate balance of anti-oxidants and pro-oxidants, and protection from damaging reactive oxygen species are clearly crucial in insects for viability, normal functioning of signalling pathways and morphogenesis, and have been implicated in studies on longevity in flies and other organisms.

      Two novel selenoproteins, dselH and dselK, were recently identified in Drosophila melanogaster. We have used RNAi in D. melanogaster embryos and in Schneider S2 cells to inhibit expression of these proteins. We report that inhibition of either dselH or dselK expression significantly reduces viability in embryos. We further show that dselH silencing decreases total anti-oxidant capacity in embryos and Schneider cells, and increases lipid peroxidation in cells. Conversely, transient expression of dselH in the cell line decreases lipid peroxidation, and reverses the toxic effects of a glutathione-depleting drug. The latter correlates with sparing of glutathione levels.

Regulation of Wingless and Vestigial expression in wing and haltere discs of Drosophila,12620980,10.1242/dev.00393,"In the third thoracic segment of Drosophila, wing development is suppressed by the homeotic selector gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in order to mediate haltere development. Previously, we have shown that Ubx represses dorsoventral (DV) signaling to specify haltere fate. Here we examine the mechanism of Ubx-mediated downregulation of DV signaling. We show that Wingless (Wg) and Vestigial (Vg) are differentially regulated in wing and haltere discs. In wing discs, although Vg expression in non-DV cells is dependent on DV boundary function of Wg, it maintains its expression by autoregulation. Thus, overexpression of Vg in non-DV cells can bypass the requirement for Wg signaling from the DV boundary. Ubx functions, at least, at two levels to repress Vestigial expression in non-DV cells of haltere discs. At the DV boundary, it functions downstream of Shaggy/GSK3 beta to enhance the degradation of Armadillo (Arm), which causes downregulation of Wg signaling. In non-DV cells, Ubx inhibits event(s) downstream of Arm, but upstream of Vg autoregulation. Repression of Vg at multiple levels appears to be crucial for Ubx-mediated specification of the haltere fate. Overexpression of Vg in haltere discs is enough to override Ubx function and cause haltere-to-wing homeotic transformations.",2003,"Mohit Prasad, Ruchi Bajpai, L S Shashidhara, Mohit Prasad, Ruchi Bajpai, L S Shashidhara"
"Troponin C in different insect muscle types: identification of two isoforms in Lethocerus, Drosophila and Anopheles that are specific to asynchronous flight muscle in the adult insect",12558500,10.1042/BJ20021814,"The indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of Lethocerus (giant water bug) and Drosophila (fruitfly) are asynchronous: oscillatory contractions are produced by periodic stretches in the presence of a Ca(2+) concentration that does not fully activate the muscle. The troponin complex on thin filaments regulates contraction in striated muscle. The complex in IFM has subunits that are specific to this muscle type, and stretch activation may act through troponin. Lethocerus and Drosophila have an unusual isoform of the Ca(2+)-binding subunit of troponin, troponin C (TnC), with a single Ca(2+)-binding site near the C-terminus (domain IV); this isoform is only in IFMs, together with a minor isoform with an additional Ca(2+)-binding site in the N-terminal region (domain II). Lethocerus has another TnC isoform in leg muscle which also has two Ca(2+)-binding sites. Ca(2+) binds more strongly to domain IV than to domain II in two-site isoforms. There are four isoforms in Drosophila and Anopheles (malarial mosquito), three of which are also in adult Lethocerus. A larval isoform has not been identified in Lethocerus. Different TnC isoforms are expressed in the embryonic, larval, pupal and adult stages of Drosophila; the expression of the two IFM isoforms is increased in the pupal stage. Immunoelectron microscopy shows the distribution of the major IFM isoform with one Ca(2+)-binding site is uniform along Lethocerus thin filaments.

A survey of the DNA sequences surrounding the Bari1 repeats in the pericentromeric h39 region of Drosophila melanogaster,12706899,10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00458-x,"In Drosophila melanogaster, clustered copies of the Bari1 transposon are only present in the pericentromeric h39 region of the second chromosome, where other clusters of repetitive elements, either found organized in large tandem arrays only in the h39 region (Responder, PortoI), or both in the h39 region and in other heterochromatic regions (Hoppel), are also observed. The topological relationship among the repetitive sequences of the h39 region and the nature of the sequences separating its large repeat clusters are at present largely unknown. To get new insights on the sequence composition of the heterochromatin and on the forces governing its origin and maintenance, we have cloned and analyzed part of the DNA sequences flanking the h39 Bari1 repeats. In a region spanning 3 and 9 kb, respectively, from the ends of a Bari1 array we found only single copies of the PortoI and Hoppel transposable elements, and five copies of a variant form of the Responder repeats. No large tandem arrays of any repeated element were present. In addition, a highly conserved 596 bp sequence, that may have a functional role, is present on both sides of the Bari1 repeats. We suggest that the current organization of the h39 heterochromatin implies some topological or functional constraint that prevents the formation of further arrays of repetitive elements in the region.",2003,"Renè Massimiliano Marsano, Roberta Moschetti, Paolo Barsanti, Corrado Caggese, Ruggiero Caizzi, Renè Massimiliano Marsano, Roberta Moschetti, Paolo Barsanti, Corrado Caggese, Ruggiero Caizzi"
JNK signaling confers tolerance to oxidative stress and extends lifespan in Drosophila,14602080,10.1016/s1534-5807(03)00323-x,"Changes in the genetic makeup of an organism can extend lifespan significantly if they promote tolerance to environmental insults and thus prevent the general deterioration of cellular function that is associated with aging. Here, we introduce the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway as a genetic determinant of aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Based on expression profiling experiments, we demonstrate that JNK functions at the center of a signal transduction network that coordinates the induction of protective genes in response to oxidative challenge. JNK signaling activity thus alleviates the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we show that flies with mutations that augment JNK signaling accumulate less oxidative damage and live dramatically longer than wild-type flies. Our work thus identifies the evolutionarily conserved JNK signaling pathway as a major genetic factor in the control of longevity.",2003,"Meng C Wang, Dirk Bohmann, Heinrich Jasper, Meng C Wang, Dirk Bohmann, Heinrich Jasper"
The N-terminal and transmembrane domains of Commissureless are necessary for its function and trafficking within neurons,14550530,10.1016/s0925-4773(03)00179-5,"Commissureless (Comm) is a novel transmembrane molecule necessary both for commissural axons to cross the midline of the Drosophila central nervous system and normal synaptogenesis. Comm is able to reduce cell surface levels of Roundabout (Robo), a receptor for the midline repellent Slit, on commissural axons and unknown inhibitors of synaptogenesis expressed on muscle cells. Comm is expressed dynamically and is found at the cell surface and within intracellular vesicles. Comm can bind Robo and when the proteins are co-expressed Robo is found co-localised with Comm intracellularly. Here we show that the ability of Comm to localise intracellularly and hence regulate Robo surface levels requires sequences in both the N-terminal and transmembrane domains. We also show that Comm can dimerise via its N-terminal domain. Furthermore, absence of the Comm N-terminal and transmembrane regions results in the protein being restricted to the neuron soma.",2003,"Marios Georgiou, Guy Tear, Marios Georgiou, Guy Tear"

We have cloned pSlo, the BK channel alpha subunit of the cockroach Periplaneta americana. The amino acid sequence of pSlo shows 88% identity to dSlo from Drosophila. There are five alternatively spliced positions in pSlo showing differential expression in various tissues. A pSlo-specific antibody prominently stained the octopaminergic dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons and peptidergic midline neurons in Periplaneta abdominal ganglia. HEK293 cells expressing pSlo exhibit K+ channels of 170 pS conductance. They have a tendency for brief closures, exhibit subconductance states and show slight inward rectification. Activation kinetics and voltage dependence are controlled by cytoplasmic [Ca2+]. In contrast to dSlo, pSlo channels are sensitive to charybdotoxin and iberiotoxin. Mutagenesis at two positions (E254 and Q285) changed blocking efficacy of charybdotoxin. In contrast to pSlo expressed in HEK293 cells, native IbTx-sensitive K,Ca currents in DUM and in peptidergic neurons, exhibited rapid, partial inactivation. The fast component of the K,Ca current partly accounts for the repolarization and the early after-hyperpolarization of the action potential. By means of Ca2+-induced repolarization, BK channels may reduce the risk of Ca2+ overload in cockroach neurons. Interestingly, the neurons expressing pSlo were also found to express taurine, a messenger that is likely to limit overexcitation by an autocrine mechanism in mammalian central neurons.",2003,"C Derst, S Messutat, C Walther, M Eckert, S H Heinemann, D Wicher, C Derst, S Messutat, C Walther, M Eckert, S H Heinemann, D Wicher"
Purification of Drosophila melanogaster ultraspiracle protein and analysis of its A/B region-dependent dimerization behavior in vitro,12674500,10.1515/BC.2003.007,"Two members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, EcR (ecdysteroid receptor protein) and Usp (Ultraspiracle), heterodimerize to form a functional receptor for the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and thus enable it to coordinate morphogenetic events during insect metamorphosis. N-terminally His-tagged Usp was overexpressed in E. coli cells as a non-truncated protein and purified to homogeneity in two chromatographic steps. It was demonstrated that the recombinant receptor specifically binds the ecdysone response element of the hsp27 gene promoter (hsp27EcRE). Moreover, a highly synergistically formed heterodimeric complex with the DNA-binding domain of EcR was observed on hsp27EcRE, but not on the native Usp response element from the chorion s15 gene promoter. Recombinant Usp forms homodimers and homotetramers in the absence of DNA, as judged from gel filtration and chemical crosslinking experiments. Truncation of its N-terminal A/B region changes molecular characteristics of Usp, considerably weakening its oligomerization potential under the same experimental conditions.

Development of the Drosophila genital disc requires interactions between its segmental primordia,12466197,10.1242/dev.00214,"In both sexes, the Drosophila genital disc comprises three segmental primordia: the female genital primordium derived from segment A8, the male genital primordium derived from segment A9 and the anal primordium derived from segments A10-11. Each segmental primordium has an anterior (A) and a posterior (P) compartment, the P cells of the three segments being contiguous at the lateral edges of the disc. We show that Hedgehog (Hh) expressed in the P compartment differentially signals A cells at the AP compartment border and A cells at the segmental border. As in the wing imaginal disc, cell lineage restriction of the AP compartment border is defined by Hh signalling. There is also a lineage restriction barrier at the segmental borders, even though the P compartment cells of the three segments converge in the lateral areas of the disc. Lineage restriction between segments A9 and A10-11 depends on factors other than the Hh, En and Hox genes. The segmental borders, however, can be permeable to some morphogenetic signals. Furthermore, cell ablation experiments show that the presence of all primordia (either the anal or the genital primordium) during development are required for normal development of genital disc. Collectively, these findings suggest that interaction between segmental primordia is required for the normal development of the genital disc.",2003,"Nicole Gorfinkiel, Lucas Sánchez, Isabel Guerrero, Nicole Gorfinkiel, Lucas Sánchez, Isabel Guerrero"

A protein, termed transducer of regulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (TORC1), was identified that activated expression through the variant CRE and consensus CRE sites. TORC1 potently induced known CREB1 target genes, bound CREB1, and activated expression through a potent transcription activation domain. A functional Drosophila TORC gene was also identified.

The neural receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase DPTP69D is required during periods of axon outgrowth in Drosophila,12807778,,"We have isolated and characterized a series of 18 chemically induced alleles of Ptp69D ranging in strength from viable to worse than null, which represent unique tools for probing the structure, function, and signaling pathway of DPTP69D. Three alleles are strongly temperature sensitive and were used to define the developmental periods requiring DPTP69D function; adult health requires DPTP69D during the mid- to late-pupal stage, eclosion requires DPTP69D during the early to mid-larval stage, and larval survival requires DPTP69D during embryogenesis. Mutations predicted to abolish the phosphatase activity of the membrane proximal D1 domain severely reduce but do not abolish DPTP69D function. Six alleles appear null; only 20% of null homozygotes pupate and <5% eclose, only to fall into the food and drown. One allele, Ptp69D(7), confers axon and viability defects more severe than those of the null phenotype. Sequence analysis predicts that Ptp69D(7) encodes a mutant protein that may bind but not release substrate. Like mutations in the protein tyrosine phosphatase gene Dlar, strong Ptp69D alleles cause the ISNb nerve to bypass its muscle targets. Genetic analysis reveals that the bypass defect in Dlar and Ptp69D mutants is dependent upon DPTP99A function, consistent with the hypothesis that DPTP69D and DLAR both counteract DPTP99A, allowing ISNb axons to enter their target muscle field.",2003,"Chand Desai, Joy Purdy, Chand Desai, Joy Purdy"

Characterization of a functionally expressed dipeptidyl aminopeptidase III from Drosophila melanogaster,12846841,10.1046/j.1432-1033.2003.03689.x,"A Drosophila melanogaster cDNA clone (GH01916) encoding a putative 723-residue long (82 kDa) protein (CG 7415) and displaying 50% identity with mammalian cytosolic dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPP) III was functionally expressed in Schneider S2 cells. Immunocytochemical studies using anti-(rat liver DPP III) Ig indicated the expression of this putative DPP III at the outer cell membrane and into the cytosol of transfected cells. Two protein bands (82 and 86 kDa) were immunologically detected after PAGE and Western blot of cytosol or membrane prepared from transfected cells. Western blot analysis of partially purified D. melanogaster DPP III confirmed the overexpression of these two protein bands into the cytosol and on the membranes of transfected cells. Despite the identification of six potential glycosylation sites, PAGE showed that these protein bands were not shifted after deglycosylation experiments. The partially purified enzyme hydrolysed the insect myotropic neuropeptide proctolin (Arg-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Thr) at the Tyr-Leu bond (Km approximately 4 micro m). In addition, low concentration of the specific DPP III inhibitor tynorphin prevented proctolin degradation (IC50 = 0.62 +/- 0.15 micro m).

Oogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: a model system for studying cell differentiation and development,14677427,,"Drosophila oogenesis is a complex developmental process involving the coordinated differentiation of germ line and somatic cells. Correct execution and timing of cell fate specification and patterning events is achieved during this process by the integration of different cell-cell signalling pathways, eventually leading to the generation of positional information inside the oocyte, that is instrumental for the establishment of embryonic polarity. The large body of data accumulated at both cellular and molecular levels in the last decade clearly demonstrated how Drosophila oogenesis is a genetically tractable system particularly suited for the investigation of key developmental biology questions. Our recent contribution to the field relies on the characterisation of three different mutants named tegamino (teg), hold hup (hup) and tulipano (tip), identifying novel gene functions required during oogenesis. Specifically, teg is implicated in the morphogenesis of the follicular epithelium surrounding the germ line cells in the egg chamber, hup is involved in the establishment of egg chamber polarity and tip in the regulation of the dynamic germ cell chromatin organisation.",2003,"Silvia Gigliotti, Deborah Rotoli, Franco Graziani, Carla Malva, Silvia Gigliotti, Deborah Rotoli, Franco Graziani, Carla Malva"

We created mutations in both genes: Mmp1 mutants have defects in larval tracheal growth and pupal head eversion, and Mmp2 mutants have defects in larval tissue histolysis and epithelial fusion during metamorphosis; neither is required for embryonic development. Double mutants also complete embryogenesis, and these represent the first time, to our knowledge, that all MMPs have been disrupted in any organism.

Sequence variation of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) paralogs in cactophilic Drosophila,12586706,,"This study focuses on the population genetics of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) in cactophilic Drosophila. Drosophila mojavensis and D. arizonae utilize cactus hosts, and each host contains a characteristic mixture of alcohol compounds. In these Drosophila species there are two functional Adh loci, an adult form (Adh-2) and a larval and ovarian form (Adh-1). Overall, the greater level of variation segregating in D. arizonae than in D. mojavensis suggests a larger population size for D. arizonae. There are markedly different patterns of variation between the paralogs across both species. A 16-bp intron haplotype segregates in both species at Adh-2, apparently the product of an ancient gene conversion event between the paralogs, which suggests that there is selection for the maintenance of the intron structure possibly for the maintenance of pre-mRNA structure. We observe a pattern of variation consistent with adaptive protein evolution in the D. mojavensis lineage at Adh-1, suggesting that the cactus host shift that occurred in the divergence of D. mojavensis from D. arizonae had an effect on the evolution of the larval expressed paralog. Contrary to previous work we estimate a recent time for both the divergence of D. mojavensis and D. arizonae (2.4 +/- 0.7 MY) and the age of the gene duplication (3.95 +/- 0.45 MY).",2003,"Luciano M Matzkin, Walter F Eanes, Luciano M Matzkin, Walter F Eanes"

Therefore, new and more effective anticonvulsants are continually sought after to combat this illness. In this study, we present results which offer the possibility of using Drosophila bang-sensitive (BS) mutants as a tool to screen anticonvulsants. By feeding the BS mutants a known anticonvulsant, potassium bromide, we have demonstrated that the drug dramatically reduces the seizures of bang senseless, the most severe of the BS mutants.

The coiled-coil domain is the structural determinant for mammalian homologues of Drosophila Sina-mediated degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein and other tripartite motif proteins by the proteasome,14645235,10.1074/jbc.M306407200,"Mammalian homologues of Drosophila Seven in Absentia (SIAHs) target for proteasome-mediated degradation several factors involved in cell growth and tumorigenesis. Here we show that SIAH-1/2 binds and targets for proteasome-mediated degradation the putative tumor suppressor and tripartite motif (TRIM) family member PML, leading to the loss of its transcriptional co-activating properties and a reduction in the number of endogenous PML nuclear bodies. Association with PML requires the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of SIAH-1/2 through an interacting surface apparently distinct from those predicted by the structural studies, or shown experimentally to mediate binding to SIAH-associated factors. Within PML, the coiled-coil domain is required for Siah- and proteasome-mediated degradation, and deletions of regions critical for the integrity of this region impair the ability of Siah to trigger PML-RAR degradation. Fusion of the coiled-coil domain to heterologous proteins resulted in the capacity of mSiah-2 to target their degradation. All of the TRIM proteins tested were degraded upon mSiah-2 overexpression. Finally, we show that the fusion protein PML-RAR (that retains the coiled-coil domain), which causes acute promyelocytic leukemias, is also a potential substrate of mSiah-2. As a result of mSiah-2 overexpression and subsequent degradation of the fusion protein, the arrest in hematopoietic differentiation because of expression of PML-RAR is partially rescued.

They are mainly transmitted vertically, from mothers to offspring and induce various alterations of their hosts' sexuality and reproduction, the most commonly reported phenomenon being Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI), observed in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Basically, CI results in a more or less intense embryonic mortality, occurring in crosses between males infected by Wolbachia and uninfected females. In D. simulans, Wolbachia and CI were observed in 1986. Since then, this host species has become a model system for investigating the polymorphism of Wolbachia infections and CI. In this review we describe the different Wolbachia infections currently known to occur in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The two species are highly contrasting with regard to symbiotic diversity: while five Wolbachia variants have been described in D. simulans natural populations, D. melanogaster seems to harbor one Wolbachia variant only. Another marked difference between these two Drosophila species is their permissiveness with regard to CI, which seems to be fully expressed in D. simulans but partially or totally repressed in D. melanogaster, demonstrating the involvement of host factors in the control of CI levels.

Traditional and Modern Biomedical Prospecting: Part II-the Benefits: Approaches for a Sustainable Exploitation of Biodiversity (Secondary Metabolites and Biomaterials from Sponges),15480439,10.1093/ecam/neh030,"The progress in molecular and cell biology has enabled a rational exploitation of the natural resources of the secondary metabolites and biomaterials from sponges (phylum Porifera). It could be established that these natural substances are superior for biomedical application to those obtained by the traditional combinatorial chemical approach. It is now established that the basic structural and functional elements are highly conserved from sponges to the crown taxa within the Protostomia (Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans) and Deuterostomia (human); therefore, it is obvious that the molecular etiology of diseases within the metazoan animals have a common basis. Hence, the major challenge for scientists studying natural product chemistry is to elucidate the target(s) of a given secondary metabolite, which is per se highly active and selective. After this step, the potential clinical application can be approached. The potential value of some selected secondary metabolites, all obtained from sponges and their associated microorganisms, is highlighted. Examples of compounds that are already in medical use (inhibition of tumor/virus growth [arabinofuranosyl cytosine and arabinofuranosyl adenine]), or are being considered as lead structures (acting as cytostatic and anti-inflammatory secondary metabolites [avarol/avarone], causing induction of apoptosis [sorbicillactone]) or as prototypes for the interference with metabolic pathways common in organisms ranging from sponges to humans (modulation of pathways activated by fungal components [aeroplysinin], inhibition of angiogenesis [2-methylthio-1,4-napthoquinone], immune modulating activity [FK506]) are discussed in this study. In addition, bioactive proteins from sponges are listed (antibacterial activity [pore-forming protein and tachylectin]).

In situ developmental gene analysis, in addition to northern, western and RT-PCR techniques during Drosophila embryonic, larval and adult development, are consistent with this identification. That is, strong expression of phm is restricted to the prothoracic gland cells of the Drosophila larval ring gland, where it undergoes dramatic changes in expression, and in the adult ovary, but also in the embryonic epidermis.

The human protein Hugl-1 substitutes for Drosophila lethal giant larvae tumour suppressor function in vivo,15467749,10.1038/sj.onc.1208023,"Drosophila lethal giant larvae: (lgl), discs large (dlg) and scribble (scrib) are tumour suppressor genes acting in a common pathway, whose loss of function leads to disruption of cell polarity and tissue architecture, uncontrolled proliferation and growth of neoplastic lesions. Mammalian homologues of these genes are highly conserved and evidence is emerging concerning their role in cell proliferation control and tumorigenesis in humans. Here we investigate the functional conservation between Drosophila lethal giant larvae and its human homologue Hugl-1(Llgl1). We first show that Hugl-1 is lost in human solid malignancies, supporting its role as a tumour suppressor in humans. Hugl-1 expression in homozygous lgl Drosophila mutants is able to rescue larval lethality; imaginal tissues do not show any neoplastic features, with Dlg and Scrib exhibiting the correct localization; animals undergo a complete metamorphosis and hatch as viable adults. These data demonstrate that Hugl-1 can act as a tumour suppressor in Drosophila and thus is the functional homologue of lgl.

The Drosophila MBD2/3 protein mediates interactions between the MI-2 chromatin complex and CpT/A-methylated DNA,15537686,10.1242/dev.01531,"Methyl-DNA binding proteins play an important role in epigenetic gene regulation. The Drosophila genome encodes a single protein (MBD2/3) with extended homologies to the vertebrate methyl-DNA binding proteins MBD2 and MBD3. However, very little is known about its functional properties. We have now characterized an MBD2/3 null mutant allele that is viable and fertile. This mutation caused a strong dominant suppression of position-effect variegation and also resulted in a high rate of chromosome segregation defects during early embryogenesis. Confocal analysis of mutant embryos showed local displacement of MI-2 from DNA and indicated that MBD2/3 is associated with only a subset of MI-2 complexes. In addition, band shift experiments demonstrated a specific binding of MBD2/3 to CpT/A-methylated DNA, which reflects the endogenous DNA methylation pattern of Drosophila. Consistently, the localization of MBD2/3 was disrupted in embryos with reduced levels of DNA methylation. Our data provide novel insights into the function of MBD2/3 proteins and strongly suggest the existence of methylation-dependent chromatin structures in Drosophila.",2004,"Joachim Marhold, Katja Kramer, Elisabeth Kremmer, Frank Lyko, Joachim Marhold, Katja Kramer, Elisabeth Kremmer, Frank Lyko"
Genome-wide microarray analysis of TGFbeta signaling in the Drosophila brain,15473904,10.1186/1471-213X-4-14,"Background:
        
      
      Members of TGFbeta superfamily are found to play important roles in many cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, development, apoptosis, and cancer. In Drosophila, there are seven ligands that function through combinations of three type I receptors and two type II receptors. These signals can be roughly grouped into two major TGFbeta pathways, the dpp/BMP and activin pathways, which signal primarily through thick veins (tkv) and baboon (babo). Few downstream targets are known for either pathway, especially targets expressed in the Drosophila brain.
    


          Results:
        
      
      tkv and babo both affect the growth of tissues, but have varying effects on patterning. We have identified targets for the tkv and babo pathways by employing microarray techniques using activated forms of the receptors expressed in the brain. In these experiments, we compare the similarities of target genes of these two pathways in the brain. About 500 of 13,500 examined genes changed expression at 95% confidence level (P < 0.05). Twenty-seven genes are co-regulated 1.5 fold by both the tkv and babo pathways. These regulated genes cluster into various functional groups such as DNA/RNA binding, signal transducers, enzymes, transcription regulators, and neuronal regulators. RNAi knockdown experiments of homologs of several of these genes show abnormal growth regulation, suggesting these genes may execute the growth properties of TGFbeta.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Our genomic-wide microarray analysis has revealed common targets for the tkv and babo pathways and provided new insights into downstream effectors of two distinct TGFbeta like pathways. Many of these genes are novel and several genes are implicated in growth control. Among the genes regulated by both pathways is ultraspiracle, which further connects TGFbeta with neuronal remodeling.",2004,"Maocheng Yang, Don Nelson, Yoko Funakoshi, Richard W Padgett, Maocheng Yang, Don Nelson, Yoko Funakoshi, Richard W Padgett"

Filopodia formation and Disabled degradation downstream of Reelin,15521821,10.1042/BJ20041588,"During Drosophila embryogenesis, Abl (Abelson tyrosine kinase) is localized in the axons of the CNS (central nervous system). Mutations in Abl have a subtle effect on the morphology of the embryonic CNS, and the mutant animals survive to the pupal and adult stages. However, genetic screens have identified several genes that, when mutated along with the Abl gene, modified the phenotypes. Two prominent genes that arose from these screens were enabled (Ena) and disabled (Dab). It has been known for some time that Enabled and its mammalian homologues are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, and promote actin polymerization at the leading edge of motile cells. It was a defect in actin polymerization in migrating neurons in particular that resulted in the identification of Enabled as an important regulator of neuronal migration. Defects in Disabled, in both Drosophila and mammals, also gave rise to neuronal defects which, in mice, were indistinguishable from phenotypes observed in the reeler mouse. These observations suggested that mDab1 (mammalian Disabled homologue 1) acted in a pathway downstream of Reelin, the product of the reelin gene found to be defective in reeler mice. Now, in this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Takenawa and colleagues have demonstrated that Disabled also acts in a pathway to regulate actin dynamics through the direct activation of N-WASP (neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein). Furthermore, they were also able to link several lines of investigation from other groups to show that the ability of mDab1 to regulate actin dynamics during cell motility was under the negative control of tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of mDab1.",2004,"Steven J Winder, Steven J Winder"
Characterization of a lipid activated CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase from Drosophila melanogaster,15238222,10.1016/j.bbalip.2004.04.008,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is an enzyme critical for cellular phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, converting phosphocholine and cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) to CDP-choline. We have isolated a cDNA encoding an isoform of CCT from Drosophila melanogaster and expressed the recombinant native and 6 x -His-tagged forms using a baculovirus expression system in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Immunoblot using anti-phospho amino acid antibodies reveals the enzyme is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine. The purified native enzyme exhibits a V(max) value of 1352+/-159 nmol CDP-choline/min/mg, a K(m) value of 0.50+/-0.09 mM for phosphocholine, and a K' (Hill constant) value of 0.72+/-0.10 mM for CTP.

Each form of the enzyme was activated to a similar extent by synthetic PC vesicles containing 50 mol% oleate. The efficiency of lipid activation was greatest using PC vesicles containing diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), significantly less efficient activation was seen when phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) were incorporated into vesicles, and PC alone or PC vesicles containing phosphatidylethanolamine were the least efficient enzyme activators.",2004,"Beth Ann Helmink, Jon A Friesen, Beth Ann Helmink, Jon A Friesen"
Upregulation of Mitimere and Nubbin acts through cyclin E to confer self-renewing asymmetric division potential to neural precursor cells,14973280,10.1242/dev.01014,"In the Drosophila CNS, neuroblasts undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions, whereas their progeny, ganglion mother cells (GMCs), divide asymmetrically to generate terminal postmitotic neurons. It is not known whether GMCs have the potential to undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. It is also not known how precursor cells undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. Here, we report that maintaining high levels of Mitimere or Nubbin, two POU proteins, in a GMC causes it to undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. These asymmetric divisions are due to upregulation of Cyclin E in late GMC and its unequal distribution between two daughter cells. GMCs in an embryo overexpressing Cyclin E, or in an embryo mutant for archipelago, also undergo self-renewing asymmetric divisions. Although the GMC self-renewal is independent of inscuteable and numb, the fate of the differentiating daughter is inscuteable and numb-dependent. Our results reveal that regulation of Cyclin E levels, and asymmetric distribution of Cyclin E and other determinants, confer self-renewing asymmetric division potential to precursor cells, and thus define a pathway that regulates such divisions.

Sexual dimorphism of TDC activity, DA content, and survival in flies of all D. melanogaster strains under study was found. Tbetah(nM18) mutation sharply reduced TDC activity in females, while ebony had no such effect. DA content and survival under heat stress in Tbetah(nM18) flies did not differ from those in the wild type. ste and e flies had drastically increased DA content under normal conditions, dramatically decreased survival under heat stress, but increased survival under starvation. DA content and survival under heat stress were also studied in the reciprocal hybrids (males) F(1) of the cross D. virilis strains 101 (wild type) and 147 with X-linked mutation, which significantly increases DA content. 147x101 males had a considerably higher DA content and lower survival than 101x147 ones.

Three new amino acids were identified in the catalytic domains X and Y that are important for PLC catalytic activity and the generation of photoreceptor responses (ERG). One of them was found substituted in H43, which showed a low specific PLC activity, a pronounced decrease in ERG sensitivity, and a wild-type-like response termination time. The response termination times obtained from three mutants was found to be approximately inversely proportional to the amount of PLC. In addition, we show that (i) the specific PLC activity is a key factor determining the photoreceptor sensitivity; (ii) the catalytic activity and response termination are separable functions of PLC; and (iii) a mutation in the putative G alpha-interacting C2 domain causes a preferentially strong defect in latency.",2004,"Jaeseung Yoon, Hung-Tat Leung, Seunghee Lee, Chaoxian Geng, Younkyung Kim, Kwanghee Baek, William L Pak, Jaeseung Yoon, Hung-Tat Leung, Seunghee Lee, Chaoxian Geng, Younkyung Kim, Kwanghee Baek, William L Pak"
Drosophila eye disc margin is a center for organizing long-range planar polarity,15124224,10.1002/gene.20022,"Planar polarity patterning involves long-range signaling and signal transduction.

To identify the sites for long-range polarity signaling in eye disc, we examined spatial and temporal conditions for nonautonomous Dsh function. Here we show that Dsh and its downstream factor Armadillo (Arm) are required in the border region of eye disc between the peripodial membrane (PM) and the disc proper (DP) for nonautonomous signaling. Conditional misexpression of Dsh or Arm at the posterior margin of the disc was sufficient to induce nonautonomous polarity reversals. A critical time window for the induction of such changes was approximately coincident with the timing of morphogenetic furrow initiation.

Drosophila melanogaster innate immunity: an emerging role for peptidoglycan recognition proteins in bacteria detection,15004693,10.1007/s00018-003-3243-0,"Over the past years, parallel studies conducted in mammals and flies have emphasized the existence of common mechanisms regulating the vertebrate and invertebrate innate immune systems. This culminated in the discovery of the central role of the Toll pathway in Drosophila immunity and in the implication of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)/interleukin-1(IL-1) in the mammalian innate immune response. In spite of clear similarities, such as shared intracellular pathway components, important divergences are expected between the two groups, whose last common ancestor lived more than half a billion years ago. The most obvious discrepancies lie in the mode of activation of the signalling receptors by microorganisms. In mammals, TLRs are part of protein complexes which directly recognize microbe-associated patterns, whereas Drosophila Toll functions like a classical cytokine receptor rather than a pattern recognition receptor.

Battle of the Xs,15112234,10.1002/bies.20034,"Females and males often exhibit conspicuous morphological, physiological and behavioral differences. Similarly, gene expression profiles indicate that a large portion of the genome is sex-differentially deployed, particularly in the germ line. Because males and females are so fundamentally different, each sex is likely to have a different optimal gene expression profile that is never fully achieved in either sex because of antagonistic selection in females versus males. Males are hemizygous for the X chromosome, which means that recessive male-favorable de novo mutations on the X chromosome are subject to immediate selection. In females, a recessive female-favorable mutation on one of two X chromosomes is not available for selection until it becomes frequent enough in the local population to result in homozygous individuals. Given that most mutations are recessive, one would expect that genes or alleles favoring males should accumulate on the X chromosome. Recent microarray work in Drosophila and C. elegans clearly shows the opposite. Why is the X chromosome a highly disfavored location for genes with male-biased expression in these animals?",2004,"Brian Oliver, Michael Parisi, Brian Oliver, Michael Parisi"
Activated eIF4E-binding protein slows G1 progression and blocks transformation by c-myc without inhibiting cell growth,14607835,10.1074/jbc.M310872200,"Translation initiation is poised between global regulation of cell growth and specific regulation of cell division. The mRNA cap-binding protein (eIF4E) is a critical integrator of cell growth and division because it is rate-limiting for translation initiation and is also rate-limiting for G(1) progression. Translation initiation factor eIF4E is also oncogenic and a candidate target of c-myc. Recently, an activated inhibitory 4E-binding protein (4EBP) that blocks eIF4E was used to study its regulation of Drosophila growth. We adopted this approach in mammalian cells after identifying an autosensing mechanism that protects against increased levels of 4EBP1. Increased 4EBP1 induced a quantitative increase in the inactivated phosphorylated form of 4EBP1 in vitro and in vivo. To overcome this protective mechanism, we introduced alanine substitutions at four phosphorylation/inactivation sites in 4EBP1 to constitutively activate a 4EBP mu to block eIF4E. Overexpression of activated 4EBP mu inhibited cell proliferation and completely blocked transformation by both eIF4E and c-myc, although it did not block all tested oncogenes. Surprisingly, expression of the activated 4EBP mu increased cell size and protein content. Activated 4EBP mu blocked both cell proliferation and c-myc transformation by inhibiting G(1) progression and increasing apoptosis, without decreasing protein synthesis. Our results identify mammalian eIF4E as rate-limiting for cell cycle progression before it regulates cell growth. It further identifies G(1) control by translation initiation factors as an essential genetic target of c-myc that is necessary for its ability to transform cells.",2004,"Mary Lynch, Chris Fitzgerald, Kelly A Johnston, Shanping Wang, Emmett V Schmidt, Mary Lynch, Chris Fitzgerald, Kelly A Johnston, Shanping Wang, Emmett V Schmidt"

The present study focuses on the effects of p150(Sal2) on the growth and survival of ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) cells that are deficient in expression of p150(Sal2) and of normal established human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells which abundantly express the protein. Transient expression of exogenous p150(Sal2) in OVCA cells that show little or no endogenous expression resulted in inhibition of DNA synthesis and colony formation and in increased apoptosis. OVCA cells stably transfected and expressing physiological levels of p150(Sal2) showed reduced tumorigenicity accompanied by increased expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21) and BAX. Conversely, reduction of endogenous levels of p150(Sal2) in HOSE resulted in reduced p21 expression and increased DNA synthesis. p150(Sal2) bound to the p21 promoter adjacent to the known p53 binding sites and stimulated transcription in the absence of p53.

Hox gene cross-regulatory interactions in the embryonic brain of Drosophila,15172684,10.1016/j.mod.2004.04.009,"During embryonic development of the Drosophila brain, the Hox gene labial is required for the regionalized specification of the tritocerebral neuromere. In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of Hox gene action in the CNS, we have studied the molecular and genetic basis of cross-regulatory interactions between labial and other more posterior Hox genes using the GAL4/UAS system for targeted misexpression. Misexpression of posterior Hox genes in the embryonic neuroectoderm results in a labial loss-of function phenotype and a corresponding lack of Labial protein expression in the tritocerebrum. This is due to repression of labial gene transcription in the embryonic brain. Enhancer analysis suggests that this transcriptional repression operates on a 3.65 kb brain-specific labial-enhancer element. A functional analysis of Antennapedia and Ultrabithorax protein domains shows that the transcriptional repression of labial requires homeodomain-DNA interactions but is not dependent on a functional hexapeptide. The repressive activity of a Hox protein on labial expression in the tritocerebrum can, however, be abolished by concomitant misexpression of a Hox protein and the cofactors Homothorax and nuclear-targeted Extradenticle. Taken together, these results provide novel and detailed insight into the cross-regulatory interactions of Hox genes in embryonic brain development and suggest that specification of tritocerebral neuronal identity requires equilibrated levels of a Hox protein and Hth and n-Exd cofactors.",2004,"Simon G Sprecher, Martin Müller, Lars Kammermeier, David F B Miller, Thomas C Kaufman, Heinrich Reichert, Frank Hirth, Simon G Sprecher, Martin Müller, Lars Kammermeier, David F B Miller, Thomas C Kaufman, Heinrich Reichert, Frank Hirth"

Relevant substrates of Par-1 in these pathways are just being identified, but it is not yet known how Par-1 itself is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human Par-1b (hPar-1b) interacts with and is negatively regulated by atypical PKC. hPar-1b is phosphorylated by aPKC on threonine 595, a residue conserved in Par-1 orthologs in mammals, worms, and flies. The equivalent site in hPar-1a, T564, is phosphorylated in vivo and by aPKC in vitro. Importantly, phosphorylation of hPar-1b on T595 negatively regulates the kinase activity and plasma membrane localization of hPar-1b in vivo.

Homo- and heteromultimeric histamine-gated ion channels formed by HisCl-alpha2 or HisCl-alpha1 + alpha2 subunits from Drosophila melanogaster were characterized by two-electrode voltage-clamp measurements of functionally expressed ion channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The sensitivity of heteromultimeric histamine receptors with an EC(50) of 2.3 microM is lower than that of either homomultimeric receptor. They can be further distinguished from the homomultimeric channels by their reduced sensitivity to d-tubocurarine. Heteromultimeric channels generate a spontaneous current in the absence of any agonist. This spontaneous current can be blocked in the absence of an agonist by d-tubocurarine and the histamine antagonists cimetidine, thioperamide and pyrilamine. Homomultimeric HisCl-alpha2 channels are dually gated by histamine (IC(50)=9.4 microM) and GABA (IC(50)=1.0mM), both of which are full agonists.

Kinetic and structural analyses of the recombinant protein and a truncation mutant show that the Ala-Pro segment is flexible and has no regulatory role in vitro. The homotrimer enzyme unfolds reversibly as a trimeric entity with a melting temperature of 54 degrees C, 23 degrees C lower than Escherichia coli dUTPase. In contrast to the bacterial enzyme, Mg(2+) binding modulates conformation of fly dUTPase, as identified by spectroscopy and by increment in melting temperature. A single well folded, but inactive, homotrimeric core domain is generated through three distinct steps of limited trypsinolysis. In fly, but not in bacterial dUTPase, binding of the product dUMP induces protection against proteolysis at the tryptic site reflecting formation of the catalytically competent closed conformer.

"Cg-Rel, the first Rel/NF-kappaB homolog characterized in a mollusk, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas",15013754,10.1016/S0014-5793(04)00124-3,"We report here the identification and functional characterization of Cg-Rel, a gene encoding the Crassostrea gigas homolog of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors found in insects and mammals. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that Cg-Rel shares the structural organization of Rel/NF-kappaB transcription factors of class II. It includes a Rel homology domain as well as a C-terminal transactivation domain (TD). Overexpression of Cg-Rel in the Drosophila S2 cell line activated the expression of a NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene, whereas transfection with a Cg-Rel construct containing a C-terminal deletion of the TD or using a reporter gene with mutated kappaB binding sites failed to activate expression. These results suggest that Cg-Rel is a functional member of the Rel family of transcription factors, making this the sixth structurally homologous component of the Rel/NF-kappaB pathway characterized in C. gigas. Based on homology to other invertebrates' Rel/NF-kappaB cascade, the function of the oyster pathway may serve to regulate genes involved in innate defense and/or development. These findings serve to highlight a potentially important regulatory pathway to the study of oyster immunology, hence allowing comparison of the immune system in vertebrates and invertebrates, an important key issue to understand its evolution.",2004,"C Montagnani, C Kappler, J M Reichhart, J M Escoubas, C Montagnani, C Kappler, J M Reichhart, J M Escoubas"

      The expression of segmentation genes plays a crucial role in the establishment of the Drosophila body plan. Using the IBM DB2 Relational Database Management System we have designed and implemented the FlyEx database. FlyEx contains 2832 images of 14 segmentation gene expression patterns obtained from 954 embryos and 2,073,662 quantitative data records. The averaged data is available for most of segmentation genes at eight time points. FlyEx supports operations on images of gene expression patterns. The database can be used to examine the quality of data, analyze the dynamics of formation of segmentation gene expression domains, as well as estimate the variability of gene expression patterns. We also provide the capability to download data of interest.

Polycomb mediates Myc autorepression and its transcriptional control of many loci in Drosophila,16357214,10.1101/gad.1352305,"Aberrant accumulation of the Myc oncoprotein propels proliferation and induces carcinogenesis. In normal cells, however, an abundance of Myc protein represses transcription at the c-myc locus. Cancer cells often lose this autorepression. We examined the control of myc in Drosophila and show here that the Drosophila ortholog, dmyc, also undergoes autorepression. We find that the developmental repressor Polycomb (Pc) is required for dmyc autorepression, and that this Pc-dMyc-mediated repression spreads across an 875-kb region encompassing the dmyc gene. To further investigate the relationship between Myc and Polycomb, we used microarrays to identify genes regulated by each, and identify a striking relationship between the two: A large set of dMyc activation targets is normally repressed by Pc, and 73% of dMyc repression targets require Pc for this repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that many dMyc-Pc-repressed loci have an epigenetic mark recognized by Pc. Our results suggest a novel relationship between Myc and Polycomb, wherein Myc enhances Polycomb repression in order to repress targets, and Myc suppresses Polycomb repression in order to activate targets.",2005,"Julie M Goodliffe, Eric Wieschaus, Michael D Cole, Julie M Goodliffe, Eric Wieschaus, Michael D Cole"

The Drosophila homologue, vnd, interacts genetically with the high-mobility group protein, Dichaete, in a manner suggesting co-operative activation [Zhao and Skeath (2002) Development, 129, 1165-1174]. However, evidence for direct interactions and transcriptional activation is lacking. Here, we present molecular evidence for the interaction of Vnd and Dichaete that leads to the activation of target gene expression. Two-hybrid interaction assays indicate that Dichaete binds the Vnd homeodomain, and additional Vnd sequences stabilize this interaction. In addition, Vnd has two activation domains that are typically masked in the intact protein. Whether vnd can activate or repress transcription is context-dependent. Full-length Vnd, when expressed as a Gal4 fusion protein, acts as a repressor containing multiple repression domains. A divergent domain in the N-terminus, not found in vertebrate Vnd-like proteins, causes the strongest repression. The co-repressor, Groucho, enhances Vnd repression, and these two proteins physically interact. The data presented indicate that the activation and repression domains of Vnd are complex, and whether Vnd functions as a transcriptional repressor or activator depends on both intra- and inter-molecular interactions.",2005,"Zhongxin Yu, Li-Jyun Syu, Dervla M Mellerick, Zhongxin Yu, Li-Jyun Syu, Dervla M Mellerick"

Results showed that the parasitoids were almost never encapsulated in D. melanogaster larvae, while 45% were encapsulated in D. simulans. A. citri induced a targeted disruption of the hematopoietic organs and a decrease of the hemocytes load in host larvae of both species. Despite such disruptive immune effects most D. simulans larvae succeeded in encapsulating A. citri eggs, probably thanks to their ability to immediately mount a capsule after infestation.

Knowledge of protein interactions and the components of cell signalling pathways in the fly and worm are particularly valuable as hypotheses can be rapidly tested using the powerful genetic toolkits available. Invertebrates offer additional experimental advantages when attempting to characterise protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Their relatively small genome size compared to mammals helps to reduce missed interactions due to redundancy, and their function can be addressed using forward (mutants) and reverse (RNA interference) genetics. However, the researcher looking for evidence of PPIs for a protein of interest is faced with the challenge of extracting interaction data from sources that are highly varied, such as the results of microarray experiments in the unstructured text of research papers. This challenge is greatly reduced by a range of public databases of curated information, as well as publicly available, enhanced search engines, which can provide either direct experimental evidence for a PPI, or valuable clues for generating new hypotheses.",2005,"Steven D Buckingham, Steven D Buckingham"
Glutamatergic innervation of the heart initiates retrograde contractions in adult Drosophila melanogaster,15647470,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2906-04.2005,"The adult abdominal heart of Drosophila melanogaster receives extensive innervation from glutamatergic neurons at specific cardiac regions during metamorphosis. Here, we show that the neurons form presynaptic specializations, as indicated by the localization of synaptotagmin and active zone markers, adjacent to postsynaptic sites that have aggregates of glutamate IIA receptors. To determine the role of this innervation in cardiac function, we developed an optical technique, based on the movement of green fluorescent protein-labeled nerve terminals, to monitor heart beat in intact and semi-intact preparations. Simultaneous monitoring of adjacent cardiac chambers revealed the direction of contractions and allowed correlation with volume changes. The cardiac cycle is composed of an anterograde beat in alternation with a retrograde beat, which correlate respectively with systole and diastole of this multichambered heart. The periodic change in hemolymph direction is referred to as cardiac reversal. Intracellular recordings from muscles of the first abdominal cardiac chamber, the conical chamber, revealed pacemaker action potentials and the excitatory effect of local glutamate application, which initiated retrograde contractions in semi-intact preparations. Unilateral electrical stimulation of the transverse nerve containing the glutamatergic neuron that serves the conical chamber caused a chronotropic effect and initiation of retrograde contractions. This effect is distinct from that of peripheral crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) neurons, which potentiate the anterograde beat. Cardiac reversal was evoked pharmacologically by sequentially applying CCAP and glutamate to the heart.",2005,"Davide Dulcis, Richard B Levine, Davide Dulcis, Richard B Levine"

These factors may be more severe when the initial study is performed using an experimental population of organisms reared under controlled lab conditions. We demonstrate that despite considerable phenotypic differences for wing shape between a lab-reared experimental population and a wild-caught cohort of Drosophila melanogaster, an association between a putative regulatory polymorphism in Egfr and wing shape can be replicated.

"FlyPNS, a database of the Drosophila embryonic and larval peripheral nervous system",15717925,10.1186/1471-213X-5-4,"Background:
        
      
      The embryonic and larval peripheral nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster is extensively studied as a very powerful model of developmental biology. One main advantage of this system is the ability to study the origin and development of individual sensory cells. However, there remain several discrepancies regarding the organization of sensory organs in each abdominal segment A1-A7.
    


          Description:
        
      
      We have constructed a web site called FlyPNS (for Fly Peripheral Nervous System) that consolidates a wide range of published and unpublished information about the embryonic and larval sensory organs. It communicates (1) a PNS pattern that solves the discrepancies that have been found in the recent literature, (2) the correspondence between the different nomenclatures that have been used so far, (3) a comprehensive description of each sensory organ, and (4) a list of both published and unpublished markers to reliably identify each PNS cell.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The FlyPNS database integrates disparate data and nomenclature and thus helps understanding the conflicting observations that have been published recently. Furthermore, it is designed to provide assistance in the identification and study of individual sensory cells. We think it will be a useful resource for any researcher with interest in Drosophila sensory organs.",2005,"Virginie Orgogozo, Wesley B Grueber, Virginie Orgogozo, Wesley B Grueber"
Disease-related phenotypes in a Drosophila model of hereditary spastic paraplegia are ameliorated by treatment with vinblastine,16276413,10.1172/JCI24694,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive weakness and spasticity of the lower limbs. Dominant mutations in the human SPG4 gene, encoding spastin, are responsible for the most frequent form of HSP. Spastin is an ATPase that binds microtubules and localizes to the spindle pole and distal axon in mammalian cell lines. Furthermore, its Drosophila homolog, Drosophila spastin (Dspastin), has been recently shown to regulate microtubule stability and synaptic function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction. Here we report the generation of a spastin-linked HSP animal model and show that in Drosophila, neural knockdown of Dspastin and, conversely, neural overexpression of Dspastin containing a conserved pathogenic mutation both recapitulate some phenotypic aspects of the human disease, including adult onset, locomotor impairment, and neurodegeneration. At the subcellular level, neuronal expression of both Dspastin RNA interference and mutant Dspastin cause an excessive stabilization of microtubules in the neuromuscular junction synapse. In addition, we provide evidence that administration of the microtubule targeting drug vinblastine significantly attenuates these phenotypes in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that loss of spastin function elicits HSP-like phenotypes in Drosophila, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of spastin mutations, and raise the possibility that therapy with Vinca alkaloids may be efficacious in spastin-associated HSP and other disorders related to microtubule dysfunction.",2005,"Genny Orso, Andrea Martinuzzi, Maria Giovanna Rossetto, Elena Sartori, Mel Feany, Andrea Daga, Genny Orso, Andrea Martinuzzi, Maria Giovanna Rossetto, Elena Sartori, Mel Feany, Andrea Daga"

Mutations in myosin VIIA (myoVIIA), an unconventional myosin, lead to deafness and balance anomalies in humans, mice, and zebrafish; individuals are deaf, and stereocilia are disorganized. The exact mechanism through which myoVIIA mutations result in these inner-ear anomalies is unknown. Proposed inner-ear functions for myoVIIA include anchoring transduction channels to the stereocilia membrane, trafficking stereocilia linking components, and anchoring hair cells by associating with adherens junctions. The Drosophila myoVIIA homolog is crinkled (ck). The Drosophila auditory organ, Johnston's organ (JO), is developmentally and functionally related to the vertebrate inner ear. Both derive from modified epithelial cells specified by atonal and spalt homolog expression, and both transduce acoustic mechanical energy (and references therein). Here, we show that loss of ck/myoVIIA function leads to complete deafness in Drosophila by disrupting the integrity of the scolopidia that transduce auditory signals. We demonstrate that ck/myoVIIA functions to organize the auditory organ, that it is functionally required in neuronal and support cells, that it is not required for TRPV channel localization, and that it is not essential for scolopidial-cell-junction integrity.",2005,"Sokol V Todi, Josef D Franke, Daniel P Kiehart, Daniel F Eberl, Sokol V Todi, Josef D Franke, Daniel P Kiehart, Daniel F Eberl"

Although the larger isoform is IFM specific, the smaller stretchin-klp isoform is expressed not only in IFM, but also in wild-type tissues of the adult head, abdomen and thorax from which the IFM has been removed. It is not detected, however, in jump or leg muscles. Probes derived from a cDNA encoding part of stretchin-klp hybridize with a 6.7 kb mRNA. Stretchin-klp is one of several putative products of the Stretchin-Myosin light chain kinase gene and is predicted to have multiple immunoglobulin domains arranged in tandem pairs separated by variable length spacers. Polyclonal antibodies directed against the expressed peptide of the stretchin-klp cDNA label the IFM myofibril A-band, though not its central and lateral regions. Analyses of IFM mutants indicate that the larger stretchin-klp isoform is myosin dependent. Although the normal adult myosin filament or the 'headless' myosin rod is sufficient for accumulation of both the large and small stretchin-klp isoforms, loss of myosin, or substitution of the adult rod with an embryonic one in IFM prevents the larger isoform from being formed or stabilized. During development stretchin-klp is first detected at pupal stage p8, when myofibrils are being constructed.

A combined STD-NMR/molecular modeling protocol for predicting the binding modes of the glycosidase inhibitors kifunensine and salacinol to Golgi alpha-mannosidase II,15865418,10.1021/bi0500426,"A combined STD-NMR/molecular modeling protocol to probe the binding modes of the glycosidase inhibitors kifunensine and salacinol to Drosophila melanogaster Golgi alpha-mannosidase II (dGMII) was tested. Saturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR experiments were carried out for the complexes of dGMII with these two inhibitors. The program AutoDock 3.0 was then used to optimize the interactions of the inhibitors with the residues in the active site of dGMII. Theoretical STD effects of the ligand protons in the complexes were calculated for the different binding modes with the recently developed CORCEMA-ST protocol. Comparison of experimental and theoretical effects then permitted selection of the likely binding modes of the ligands. The more rigid kifunensine was used initially to test the protocol. Excellent correlation between experimental and theoretical data was obtained for one of the binding modes that also corresponded to that observed in the crystal structure of the complex. The protocol was then extended to the more flexible salacinol. For the selected binding mode, good correlation of experimental and theoretical data for the five-membered ring was obtained; however, poor correlation for protons on the acyclic chain was obtained, suggesting flexibility in this portion of the molecule. Comparison of the selected binding mode with that from a crystal structure of salacinol with dGMII showed excellent superimposition of the five-membered ring but another orientation of the acyclic chain. The results suggest that reliable structural binding modes of a ligand to protein in aqueous solution can be provided with the combined use of STD-NMR spectroscopy, molecular modeling, and CORCEMA-ST calculations, although highly flexible portions of the ligand may be poorly defined.",2005,"Xin Wen, Yue Yuan, Douglas A Kuntz, David R Rose, B Mario Pinto, Xin Wen, Yue Yuan, Douglas A Kuntz, David R Rose, B Mario Pinto"
"Evolution of proteins and gene expression levels are coupled in Drosophila and are independently associated with mRNA abundance, protein length, and number of protein-protein interactions",15746013,10.1093/molbev/msi122,"Organismic evolution requires that variation at distinct hierarchical levels and attributes be coherently integrated, often in the face of disparate environmental and genetic pressures. A central part of the evolutionary analysis of biological systems remains to decipher the causal connections between organism-wide (or genome-wide) attributes (e.g., mRNA abundance, protein length, codon bias, recombination rate, genomic position, mutation rate, etc) as well as their role-together with mutation, selection, and genetic drift-in shaping patterns of evolutionary variation in any of the attributes themselves. Here we combine genome-wide evolutionary analysis of protein and gene expression data to highlight fundamental relationships among genomic attributes and their associations with the evolution of both protein sequences and gene expression levels. Our results show that protein divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression polymorphism and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of protein-protein interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with protein divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence, protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed coupling between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we show that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend to have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower mRNA abundances, whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed at higher mRNA abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions and mRNA abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila show similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences and gene expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics, possibly because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength of stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence or its mRNA expression. We conclude that, as more and better data accumulate, understanding the causal connections among biological traits and how they are integrated over time to constrain or promote structural and regulatory evolution may finally become possible.",2005,"Bernardo Lemos, Brian R Bettencourt, Colin D Meiklejohn, Daniel L Hartl, Bernardo Lemos, Brian R Bettencourt, Colin D Meiklejohn, Daniel L Hartl"

In embryos developing in utero, such as in mammals, it is necessary to dissect embryos from the mother and, upon manipulative intervention, to implant them back into the recipient. Parasitic wasps present a promising system for understanding the evolution of early developmental processes. In basal ectoparasitic species that lay eggs on the surface of the host, it is possible to adapt embryo manipulation techniques developed in Drosophila. However, their derived endoparasitic relatives, which exhibit various modifications of developmental programs, undergo concealed development within the host body. For example, the parasitic polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum oviposits an egg into the egg of the host moth Trichoplusia ni. The host larva emerges and the parasite undergoes development within the host body, preventing embryo manipulation as a means of examining developmental regulation. Here we present a protocol for embryo transfer that allows the transplantation of C. floridanum egg into the host egg. This approach opens a new avenue in the application of various embryo manipulation techniques aimed at understanding the evolution of embryogenesis in endoparasitic Hymenoptera.

Overexpression of hAtx-1 in fruit flies produces phenotypes similar to those of dAtx-1 but different from the polyglutamine peptide alone.

Simultaneous removal of the two GoLoco motif proteins, Loco and Pins, results in defects that are essentially indistinguishable from those observed in Gbeta13F or Ggamma1 mutants, suggesting that Loco and Pins act synergistically to release free Gbetagamma in neuroblasts.

Second, as the mutant cells proliferate, they lose their epithelial organization and undergo apoptosis. Strikingly, when apoptosis of mutant cells is blocked, tumor-like overgrowths are formed that are capable of metastasis. vps25 encodes a component of the ESCRT-II complex, which sorts membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies during endocytic trafficking to the lysosome. Activation of Notch and Dpp receptor signaling in mutant cells results from an endocytic blockage that causes accumulation of these receptors and other signaling components in endosomes.

Photic input pathways that mediate the Drosophila larval response to light and circadian rhythmicity are developmentally related but functionally distinct,15593374,10.1002/cne.20383,"The Drosophila melanogaster larval photosensory organ that mediates the response to light consists of bilaterally symmetrical clusters of 12 photoreceptors. These are distinguished on the basis of expression of the rhodopsins Rh5 and Rh6. The Rh6-expressing cells correspond to the Hofbauer-Buchner (H-B) eyelet found later in the posterior margin of the adult compound eye and recently shown to function as an input pathway in the entrainment of circadian rhythmicity in adult Drosophila. In addition, the axons of the larval photoreceptors are found in intimate association with a subset of the main circadian pacemaker neurons located in the developing accessory medulla, the small ventral lateral neurons (LNv). The observed spatial overlap between components of the circadian circuitry, input pathway, and pacemaker neurons-and the larval visual organ-suggest a functional relationship between these two photosensory input pathways. In this study we determined the requirement of specific rhodopsin-expressing photoreceptors including the presumptive H-B eyelet and pacemaker neurons in the larval locomotory response to visual stimuli. Our results demonstrate that two of the most important components of the neuronal circuitry underlying circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila, namely, the extraretinal H-B cluster and the circadian pacemakers, while in intimate association with the larval visual system are not required for the larval motor response to light.",2005,"Jana Hassan, Balaji Iyengar, Nadia Scantlebury, Veronica Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos, Jana Hassan, Balaji Iyengar, Nadia Scantlebury, Veronica Rodriguez Moncalvo, Ana Regina Campos"
"Valois, a component of the nuage and pole plasm, is involved in assembly of these structures, and binds to Tudor and the methyltransferase Capsuléen",15800004,10.1242/dev.01809,"Using the Capsuleen (Csul) methyltransferase as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel Drosophila protein containing multiple WD repeats and encoded by the valois (vsl) gene, which acts in pole plasm function. Vls is homologous to human MEP50, which forms a complex with the PRMT5 methyltransferase--the human homologue of Csul. We found that Vls localizes to the nuage in the nurse cells and to the pole plasm in the oocyte. Moreover vls is required for the synthesis and/or stability of Oskar and the localization of Tudor (Tud) in both the nuage and at the posterior pole of the oocyte. Furthermore, we show that Vls and a fragment of Tud interact directly in binding assay. As the PMRT5/MEP50 complex is involved in ribonucleoprotein complex assembly, we hypothesize that the Vls complex may play a similar function in assembling the nuage in nurse cells and the polar granules in the oocyte.",2005,"Joël Anne, Bernard M Mechler, Joël Anne, Bernard M Mechler"
The UNC-73/Trio RhoGEF-2 domain is required in separate isoforms for the regulation of pharynx pumping and normal neurotransmission in C. elegans,16140983,10.1101/gad.1319905,"In both Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, UNC-73/Trio functions in axon guidance by signaling through the Rac GTPase to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for growth cone migrations. Here, we show that the complex C. elegans unc-73 gene encodes at least eight differentially expressed UNC-73 intracellular protein isoforms. Previously reported mutations affecting UNC-73 isoforms encoding the Rac-specific RhoGEF-1 domain cause uncoordinated movement, correlating with defects in axon guidance. Mutations in isoforms encoding the Rho-specific RhoGEF-2 domain, which we describe here, result in L1 stage larval lethality with no associated axon guidance defects. Isoform-specific rescue experiments reveal separate functions for the various RhoGEF-2-containing UNC-73 isoforms, which would not likely be discovered by conventional genetic screening. UNC-73 D1 and D2 appear to function redundantly in pharynx muscle to regulate the rate and strength of pharynx pumping, and in the HSN neurons and vulval muscles to control egg laying. Isoforms C1, C2, E, and F act redundantly within the nervous system to regulate the speed of locomotion. The multiple UNC-73 isoforms containing Rac- and Rho-specific RhoGEF domains therefore have distinct physiological functions. In addition to its previously identified role involving RhoGEF-1 in migrating cells and growth cones, our data indicate that UNC-73 signals through RhoGEF-2 to regulate pharynx and vulva musculature and to modulate synaptic neurotransmission.",2005,"Robert Steven, Lijia Zhang, Joseph Culotti, Tony Pawson, Robert Steven, Lijia Zhang, Joseph Culotti, Tony Pawson"
Tree scanning: a method for using haplotype trees in phenotype/genotype association studies,15371364,10.1534/genetics.104.030080,"We use evolutionary trees of haplotypes to study phenotypic associations by exhaustively examining all possible biallelic partitions of the tree, a technique we call tree scanning. If the first scan detects significant associations, additional rounds of tree scanning are used to partition the tree into three or more allelic classes. Two worked examples are presented. The first is a reanalysis of associations between haplotypes at the Alcohol Dehydrogenase locus in Drosophila melanogaster that was previously analyzed using a nested clade analysis, a more complicated technique for using haplotype trees to detect phenotypic associations. Tree scanning and the nested clade analysis yield the same inferences when permutation testing is used with both approaches. The second example is an analysis of associations between variation in various lipid traits and genetic variation at the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene in three human populations. Tree scanning successfully identified phenotypic associations expected from previous analyses. Tree scanning for the most part detected more associations and provided a better biological interpretative framework than single SNP analyses. We also show how prior information can be incorporated into the tree scan by starting with the traditional three electrophoretic alleles at APOE. Tree scanning detected genetically determined phenotypic heterogeneity within all three electrophoretic allelic classes. Overall, tree scanning is a simple, powerful, and flexible method for using haplotype trees to detect phenotype/genotype associations at candidate loci.",2005,"Alan R Templeton, Taylor Maxwell, David Posada, Jari H Stengård, Eric Boerwinkle, Charles F Sing, Alan R Templeton, Taylor Maxwell, David Posada, Jari H Stengård, Eric Boerwinkle, Charles F Sing"
The identification of Hoxc8 target genes,15699330,10.1073/pnas.0409700102,"Hox genes encode transcription factors that control spatial patterning during embryogenesis. To date, downstream targets of Hox genes have proven difficult to identify. Here, we describe studies designed to identify target genes under the control of the murine transcription factor Hoxc8. We used a mouse 16,463 gene oligonucleotide microarray to identify mRNAs whose expression was altered by the overexpression of Hoxc8 in C57BL/6J mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in cell culture (in vitro). We identified a total of 34 genes whose expression was changed by 2-fold or greater: 16 genes were up-regulated, and 18 genes were down-regulated. The majority of genes encoded proteins involved in critical biological processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, metabolism, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Two genes showed high levels of regulation: (i) secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1), also known as osteopontin (OPN), was down-regulated 4.8-fold, and (ii) frizzled homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Fzd2) was up-regulated 4.4-fold.

Mouse Disp1 is required in sonic hedgehog-expressing cells for paracrine activity of the cholesterol-modified ligand,15576405,10.1242/dev.01563,"Previous studies have demonstrated that Disp1 function is essential for Shh and Ihh signaling in the mouse, and Disp1 gene dose regulates the level of Shh signaling activity in vivo. To determine whether Disp1 activity is required in Shh-producing cells for paracrine signaling in Shh target fields, we used a ShhGFP-Cre (here shortened to ShhCre) knock-in allele and a Disp1 conditional allele to knock down Disp1 activity specifically within Shh-producing cells. The resulting facial and neural tube phenotypes support the conclusion that the primary and probably exclusive role for Disp1 is within hedgehog protein-producing cells. Furthermore, using an allele that produces N-Shh (a noncholesterol modified form of the Shh protein), we demonstrate that N-Shh is sufficient to rescue most of the early embryonic lethal defects in a Disp1-null mutant background. Thus, Disp1 activity is only required for paracrine hedgehog protein signaling by the cholesterol modified form of Shh (N-Shhp), the normal product generated by auto-processing of a Shh precursor protein. In both respects, Disp function is conserved from Drosophila to mice.",2005,"Hua Tian, Juhee Jeong, Brian D Harfe, Clifford J Tabin, Andrew P McMahon, Hua Tian, Juhee Jeong, Brian D Harfe, Clifford J Tabin, Andrew P McMahon"
Cost induced by viral particles manipulating superparasitism behaviour in the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi,16145933,10.1017/s0031182005007602,"Vertically transmitted symbionts can be maintained in a host population only if they do not reduce host fitness, unless they compensate by manipulation of their host's reproduction or have alternative mode of transmission. In Leptopilina boulardi, a parasitoid of Drosophila larvae, some females are infected by viral particles showing both maternal and horizontal transmission. Horizontal transmission occurs when larvae from infected and uninfected individuals of L. boulardi compete in the same host. This situation is facilitated by the increasing tendency to accept already parasitized hosts that viral infection induces in L. boulardi females. Estimation of the adaptive significance of this behavioural modification requires measuring the effect of viral presence on other parasitoid physiological features. Here, we show that viral infection in females imposes no cost on adult survival, a low cost on developmental rate and tibia length, and leads to a strong reduction of locomotor activity. Surprisingly, infected females show higher egg load which could be accounted for by a redirection of energy allocation to egg production. The high intensity of superparasitism in infected females induced a dramatic decrease in pre-imaginal survival of the parasitoid's offspring, representing a potential indirect cost of infection. Low overall pathogeny induced by viral particles appears to be well suited to both transmission modes, both of them requiring females ability to locate and (super)parasitize hosts.",2005,"J Varaldi, M Boulétreau, F Fleury, J Varaldi, M Boulétreau, F Fleury"

Today it is widely recognized that transposable elements have colonized all eukaryotic genomes and represent a major force driving evolution of organisms.

We bring together published and unpublished work to provide a picture of the contribution of transposable elements to the evolution of the heterochromatic genome in Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, we discuss data on 1) colonization of constitutive heterochromatin by transposable elements, 2) instability of constitutive heterochromatin induced by the I factor, and 3) evolution of constitutive heterochromatin and heterochromatic genes driven by transposable elements.

Transposable element orientation bias in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,16315105,10.1007/s00239-004-0243-0,"Nonrandom distributions of transposable elements can be generated by a variety of genomic features. Using the full D. melanogaster genome as a model, we characterize the orientations of different classes of transposable elements in relation to the directionality of genes. DNA-mediated transposable elements are more likely to be in the same orientation as neighboring genes when they occur in the nontranscribed region's that flank genes. However, RNA-mediated transposable elements located in an intron are more often oriented in the direction opposite to that of the host gene. These orientation biases are strongest for genes with highly biased codon usage, probably reflecting the ability of such loci to respond to weak positive or negative selection. The leading hypothesis for selection against transposable elements in the coding orientation proposes that transcription termination poly(A) signal motifs within retroelements interfere with normal gene transcription. However, after accounting for differences in base composition between the strands, we find no evidence for global selection against spurious transcription termination signals in introns. We therefore conclude that premature termination of host gene transcription due to the presence of poly(A) signal motifs in retroelements might only partially explain strand-specific detrimental effects in the D. melanogaster genome.",2005,"Asher D Cutter, Jeffrey M Good, Christopher T Pappas, Matthew A Saunders, Dean M Starrett, Travis J Wheeler, Asher D Cutter, Jeffrey M Good, Christopher T Pappas, Matthew A Saunders, Dean M Starrett, Travis J Wheeler"
An alien promoter capture as a primary step of the evolution of testes-expressed repeats in the Drosophila melanogaster genome,15829619,10.1093/molbev/msi147,"Fertility of Drosophila melanogaster males is impaired due to the disruption of the silencing of the X-linked, testis-expressed, repeated Stellate (Ste) genes. Ste silencing is mediated by symmetric transcription of the paralogous Y-linked repeats and exerted by an RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. Here we present a scenario for the origin of the Ste genes and their suppressors. The primary intermediate of their evolution emerged as a result of the acquisition of a preformed alien, testis-specific promoter. This intermediate is identified as a chimeric gene containing coding region of an autosomal gene for testis-specific protein kinase CK2. The 5' region of the chimera has been acquired from a member of a family of testis-expressed X-linked genes of unknown function. We propose that the evolution and amplification of the novel chimeric gene have led to the overproduction of the regulatory CK2 subunit in testes. The evolution of the Y-linked descendants of the primary intermediate resulted in the RNAi-mediated suppression of excessive expression of the X-linked paralogs. The newly detected ""dead family"" of cognate repeats on the Y chromosome has contributed to the evolution of Ste and its suppressors via gene conversion. Our results show that RNAi silencing, considered as a defense against viruses and transposable elements, may be involved in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes.",2005,"Lev A Usakin, Galina L Kogan, Alla I Kalmykova, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Lev A Usakin, Galina L Kogan, Alla I Kalmykova, Vladimir A Gvozdev"

AP180 maintains the distribution of synaptic and vesicle proteins in the nerve terminal and indirectly regulates the efficacy of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis,15888532,10.1152/jn.00080.2005,"AP180 plays an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs) and has also been implicated in retrieving SV proteins. In Drosophila, deletion of its homologue, Like-AP180 (LAP), has been shown to increase the size of SVs but decrease the number of SVs and transmitter release. However, it remains elusive whether a reduction in the total vesicle pool directly affects transmitter release. Further, it is unknown whether the lap mutation also affects vesicle protein retrieval and synaptic protein localization and, if so, how it might affect exocytosis. Using a combination of electrophysiology, optical imaging, electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry, we have further characterized the lap mutant and hereby show that LAP plays additional roles in maintaining both normal synaptic transmission and protein distribution at synapses. While increasing the rate of spontaneous vesicle fusion, the lap mutation dramatically reduces impulse-evoked transmitter release at steps downstream of calcium entry and vesicle docking. Notably, lap mutations disrupt calcium coupling to exocytosis and reduce calcium cooperativity. These results suggest a primary defect in calcium sensors on the vesicles or on the release machinery. Consistent with this hypothesis, three vesicle proteins critical for calcium-mediated exocytosis, synaptotagmin I, cysteine-string protein, and neuronal synaptobrevin, are all mislocalized to the extrasynaptic axonal regions along with Dap160, an active zone marker (nc82), and glutamate receptors in the mutant. These results suggest that AP180 is required for either recycling vesicle proteins and/or maintaining the distribution of both vesicle and synaptic proteins in the nerve terminal.",2005,"Hong Bao, Richard W Daniels, Gregory T MacLeod, Milton P Charlton, Harold L Atwood, Bing Zhang, Hong Bao, Richard W Daniels, Gregory T MacLeod, Milton P Charlton, Harold L Atwood, Bing Zhang"

Although both isoforms coexisted in Drosophila cells, the Ia isoform appeared to be dominant. Furthermore, reporter assay found that Ia enhanced translation in steady-state cells while Ib increased translation in cells under oxidative stress.

Shaw potassium channel genes in Drosophila,15751025,10.1002/neu.20126,"Drosophila Shaw encodes a voltage-insensitive, slowly activating, noninactivating K(+) current. The functional and developmental roles of this channel are unknown. In this study, we use a dominant transgenic strategy to investigate Shaw function and describe a second member of the Shaw family, Shawl. In situ hybridization showed that the two Shaw family genes, Shaw and Shawl, have largely nonoverlapping expression patterns in embryos. Shaw is expressed mainly in excitable cells of the CNS and PNS of late embryos. Shawl is expressed in many nonexcitable cell types: ubiquitously in embryos until the germband extends, then transiently in the developing CNS and PNS, becoming restricted to progressively smaller subsets of the CNS. Ectopic full-length and truncated Shaw localize differently within neurons, and produce uneclosed small pupae and adults with unfurled wings and softened cuticle. This phenotype was mapped to the crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP)-neuropeptide circuit. Widespread expression of Shaw in the nervous system results in a reduction in body mass, ether-induced shaking, and lethality. Expression of full-length Shaw had more extreme phenotypic consequences and caused earlier lethality than expression of truncated Shaw in a given GAL4 pattern. Whole cell recordings from ventral ganglion motor neurons expressing the truncated Shaw protein suggest that a major role of Shaw channels in these cells is to contribute to the resting potential.",2005,"James J L Hodge, James C Choi, Cahir J O'Kane, Leslie C Griffith, James J L Hodge, James C Choi, Cahir J O'Kane, Leslie C Griffith"
Temperature influences on functional response of Coenosia attenuata (Diptera: Muscidae) individuals,16334320,10.1093/jee/98.5.1524,"The functional response of single Coenosia attenuta Stein (Diptera: Muscidae) adult females to Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) adults has been investigated at different but constant temperatures and prey densities. The experiments were conducted in cages over a wide range of temperatures between 12 and 42 degrees C. At each experimental temperature, the number of attacks increases with increasing prey density up to a maximum attack rate referred to as demand rate. A ratio-dependent and demand-driven functional response model was appropriate to describe the attack rate at different temperatures. Both the demand and the search rate linearly increased with increasing temperatures throughout the range. Based on these results, a temperature- and prey density-dependent bidimensional attack rate model was developed and parameterized. The resulting response surface shows that C. attenuata is active over a wide range of temperatures (from approximately 12 to 36 degrees C) and attacks occur up to 42 degrees C. Thus, C. attenuata may be a promising biological control agent in Mediterranean greenhouses.

Regulation of post-embryonic neuroblasts by Drosophila Grainyhead,16275038,10.1016/j.mod.2005.08.004,"The Drosophila post-embryonic neuroblasts (pNBs) are neural stem cells that persist in the larval nervous system where they proliferate to produce neurons for the adult CNS. These pNBs provide a good model to investigate mechanisms regulating the maintenance and proliferation of stem cells. The transcription factor Grainyhead (Grh), which is required for morphogenesis of epidermal and tracheal cells, is also expressed in all pNBs. Here, we show that grh is essential for pNBs to adopt the stem cell programme appropriate to their position within the CNS. In grh mutants the abdominal pNBs produced more progeny while the thoracic pNBs, in contrast, divided less and produced fewer progeny than wild type. We investigated three candidates; the Neuroblast identify gene Castor, the signalling molecule Notch and the adhesion protein E-Cadherin, to determine whether they could mediate these effects. Neither Castor nor Notch fulfilled the criteria for intermediaries, and in particular Notch activity was found to be dispensable for the normal proliferation and survival of the pNBs. In contrast E-Cadherin, which has been shown to regulate pNB proliferation, was present at greatly reduced levels in the grh mutant pNBs. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Grh was sufficient to promote ectopic E-Cadherin and two conserved Grh-binding sites were identified in the E-Cadherin/shotgun flanking sequences, arguing that this gene is a downstream target. Thus one way Grh could regulate pNBs is through expression of E-cadherin, a protein that is thought to mediate interactions with the glial niche.",2005,"Mara S Almeida, Sarah J Bray, Mara S Almeida, Sarah J Bray"
Klp67A destabilises pre-anaphase microtubules but subsequently is required to stabilise the central spindle,15928044,10.1242/jcs.02410,"Klp67A is a member of the Kip3 subfamily of microtubule destabilising kinesins, the loss of which results in abnormally long and stable pre-anaphase microtubules. Here we examine its role during cytokinesis in Drosophila primary spermatocytes that require the coordinated interaction of an interior and peripheral set of central spindle microtubules. In mutants anaphase B spindles elongated with normal kinetics but bent towards the cortex. Both peripheral and interior spindle microtubules then formed diminished bundles of abnormally positioned central spindle microtubules associated with the pavarotti-KLP and KLP3A motor proteins. The minus ends of these were poorly aligned as revealed by Asp protein localisation. Furrows always initiated at the sites of central spindle bundles but could be unilateral or nonequatorially positioned. Ectopic furrows were stimulated by the interior central spindle and formed only after this structure buckled and contacted the cortex. Furrows often halted and regressed as they could not be sustained by the central spindles that became increasing unstable over time and often completely degraded. Consistent with this, actin and anillin failed to form homogenous bands. Thus, the Klp67A microtubule catastrophe factor is required for cytokinesis by regulating both the formation and stability of the central spindle.",2005,"Melanie K Gatt, Matthew S Savoian, Maria G Riparbelli, Chiara Massarelli, Giuliano Callaini, David M Glover, Melanie K Gatt, Matthew S Savoian, Maria G Riparbelli, Chiara Massarelli, Giuliano Callaini, David M Glover"

Despite this common property, Cv shows a different BMP ligand specificity as compared with Tsg, and its expression is limited to the developing wing.

A gene network downstream of transcription factor Math5 regulates retinal progenitor cell competence and ganglion cell fate,15882586,10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.01.028,"Math5, a mouse homolog of the Drosophila proneural bHLH transcription factor Atonal, is essential in the developing retina to establish retinal progenitor cell competence for a ganglion cell fate. Elucidating the mechanisms by which Math5 influences progenitor cell competence is crucial for understanding how specification of neuronal cell fate occurs in the retina and it requires knowledge of the downstream target genes that depend on Math5 for their expression. To date, only a handful of genes downstream of Math5 have been identified. To better define the gene network operating downstream of Math5, we used custom-designed microarrays to examine the changes in embryonic retinal gene expression caused by deletion of math5. We identified 270 Math5-dependent genes, including those that were expressed specifically either in progenitor cells or differentiated ganglion cells. The ganglion cell-specific genes included both Brn3b-dependent and Brn3b-independent genes, indicating that Math5 regulates distinct branches of the gene network responsible for retinal ganglion cell differentiation. In math5-null progenitor cells, there was an up-regulation of the proneural genes math3, neuroD, and ngn2, indicating that Math5 suppresses the production of other cell types in addition to promoting retinal ganglion cell formation. The promoter regions of many Math5-dependent genes contained binding sites for REST/NRSF, suggesting that release from general repression in retinal progenitor cells is required for ganglion cell-specific gene activation. The identification of multiple roles for Math5 provides new insights into the gene network that defines progenitor cell competence in the embryonic retina.",2005,"Xiuqian Mu, Xueyao Fu, Hongxia Sun, Phillip D Beremand, Terry L Thomas, William H Klein, Xiuqian Mu, Xueyao Fu, Hongxia Sun, Phillip D Beremand, Terry L Thomas, William H Klein"

Drosophila talin and integrin genes are required for maintenance of tracheal terminal branches and luminal organization,16720877,10.1242/dev.02404,"Epithelial tubes that compose many organs are typically long lasting, except under specific developmental and physiological conditions when network remodeling occurs. Although there has been progress elucidating mechanisms of tube formation, little is known of the mechanisms that maintain tubes and destabilize them during network remodeling. Here, we describe Drosophila tendrils mutations that compromise maintenance of tracheal terminal branches, fine gauge tubes formed by tracheal terminal cells that ramify on and adhere tightly to tissues in order to supply them with oxygen. Homozygous tendrils terminal cell clones have fewer terminal branches than normal but individual branches contain multiple convoluted lumens. The phenotype arises late in development: terminal branches bud and form lumens normally early in development, but during larval life lumens become convoluted and mature branches degenerate. Their lumens, however, are retained in the remaining branches, resulting in the distinctive multi-lumen phenotype. Mapping and molecular studies demonstrate that tendrils is allelic to rhea, which encodes Drosophila talin, a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to the cytoskeleton. Terminal cells mutant for myospheroid, the major Drosophila beta-integrin, or doubly mutant for multiple edematous wings and inflated alpha-integrins, also show the tendrils phenotype, and localization of myospheroid beta-integrin protein is disrupted in tendrils mutant terminal cells.

Active zone assembly and synaptic release,17052232,10.1042/BST0340939,"Neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses occurs when synaptic vesicles fuse to the presynaptic membrane at a specialized site termed the active zone. The depolarization-induced fusion is highly dependent on calcium ions, and, correspondingly, the transmission characteristics of synapses are thought to be influenced by the spatial arrangement of voltage-gated calcium channels with respect to vesicle release sites. Here, we review the involvement of the Drosophila Bruchpilot (BRP) protein in active zone assembly, a process that is required for the clustering of presynaptic calcium channels to ensure efficient vesicle release.",2006,"R J Kittel, S Hallermann, S Thomsen, C Wichmann, S J Sigrist, M Heckmann, R J Kittel, S Hallermann, S Thomsen, C Wichmann, S J Sigrist, M Heckmann"
The Drosophila melanogaster Cajal body,16533947,10.1083/jcb.200511038,"Cajal bodies (CBs) are nuclear organelles that are usually identified by the marker protein p80-coilin. Because no orthologue of coilin is known in Drosophila melanogaster, we identified D. melanogaster CBs using probes for other components that are relatively diagnostic for CBs in vertebrate cells. U85 small CB-specific RNA, U2 small nuclear RNA, the survival of motor neurons protein, and fibrillarin occur together in a nuclear body that is closely associated with the nucleolus. Based on its similarity to CBs in other organisms, we refer to this structure as the D. melanogaster CB. Surprisingly, the D. melanogaster U7 small nuclear RNP resides in a separate nuclear body, which we call the histone locus body (HLB). The HLB is invariably colocalized with the histone gene locus. Thus, canonical CB components are distributed into at least two nuclear bodies in D. melanogaster. The identification of these nuclear bodies now permits a broad range of questions to be asked about CB structure and function in a genetically tractable organism.",2006,"Ji-Long Liu, Christine Murphy, Michael Buszczak, Sarah Clatterbuck, Robyn Goodman, Joseph G Gall, Ji-Long Liu, Christine Murphy, Michael Buszczak, Sarah Clatterbuck, Robyn Goodman, Joseph G Gall"
JAK signaling globally counteracts heterochromatic gene silencing,16892059,10.1038/ng1860,"The JAK/STAT pathway has pleiotropic roles in animal development, and its aberrant activation is implicated in multiple human cancers. JAK/STAT signaling effects have been attributed largely to direct transcriptional regulation by STAT of specific target genes that promote tumor cell proliferation or survival. We show here in a Drosophila melanogaster hematopoietic tumor model, however, that JAK overactivation globally disrupts heterochromatic gene silencing, an epigenetic tumor suppressive mechanism. This disruption allows derepression of genes that are not direct targets of STAT, as evidenced by suppression of heterochromatin-mediated position effect variegation. Moreover, mutations in the genes encoding heterochromatin components heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and Su(var)3-9 enhance tumorigenesis induced by an oncogenic JAK kinase without affecting JAK/STAT signaling. Consistently, JAK loss of function enhances heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpressing HP1 suppresses oncogenic JAK-induced tumors. These results demonstrate that the JAK/STAT pathway regulates cellular epigenetic status and that globally disrupting heterochromatin-mediated tumor suppression is essential for tumorigenesis induced by JAK overactivation.",2006,"Song Shi, Healani C Calhoun, Fan Xia, Jinghong Li, Long Le, Willis X Li, Song Shi, Healani C Calhoun, Fan Xia, Jinghong Li, Long Le, Willis X Li"
ESCRTing cell proliferation off the beaten path: lessons from the drosophila eye,16434879,10.4161/cc.5.3.2423,"A series of recently published studies have established that defects in endocytic sorting can elicit dramatic tissue overgrowth phenotypes in developing organs of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Such a link had been suggested by mammalian cell culture experiments almost ten years ago, but in vivo evidence of this link, and the mechanisms through which it might occur, had remained elusive. Drosophila has now proven to be an excellent developmental system in which to both document the effects of endocytic defects on tissue growth and patterning, and to probe the basis of these phenotypes. This work has begun to illuminate some surprising connections between the endocytic trafficking of protein cargoes and the control of cell proliferation and tissue architecture. These connections touch major cell biological processes, including cell division, growth, death, and polarity, and have begun to paint a complex, yet intriguing, picture of how defective endocytic sorting can affect developing tissues.",2006,"M Melissa Gilbert, Kenneth H Moberg, M Melissa Gilbert, Kenneth H Moberg"
Characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster genome at the nuclear lamina,16878134,10.1038/ng1852,"The nuclear lamina binds chromatin in vitro and is thought to function in its organization, but genes that interact with it are unknown. Using an in vivo approach, we identified approximately 500 Drosophila melanogaster genes that interact with B-type lamin (Lam). These genes are transcriptionally silent and late replicating, lack active histone marks and are widely spaced. These factors collectively predict lamin binding behavior, indicating that the nuclear lamina integrates variant and invariant chromatin features. Consistently, proximity of genomic regions to the nuclear lamina is partly conserved between cell types, and induction of gene expression or active histone marks reduces Lam binding. Lam target genes cluster in the genome, and these clusters are coordinately expressed during development. This genome-wide analysis gives clear insight into the nature and dynamic behavior of the genome at the nuclear lamina, and implies that intergenic DNA functions in the global organization of chromatin in the nucleus.",2006,"Helen Pickersgill, Bernike Kalverda, Elzo de Wit, Wendy Talhout, Maarten Fornerod, Bas van Steensel, Helen Pickersgill, Bernike Kalverda, Elzo de Wit, Wendy Talhout, Maarten Fornerod, Bas van Steensel"
G(o) signaling is required for Drosophila associative learning,16845387,10.1038/nn1738,"Heterotrimeric G(o) is one of the most abundant proteins in the brain, yet relatively little is known of its neural functions in vivo. Here we demonstrate that G(o) signaling is required for the formation of associative memory. In Drosophila melanogaster, pertussis toxin (PTX) is a selective inhibitor of G(o) signaling. The postdevelopmental expression of PTX within mushroom body neurons robustly and reversibly inhibits associative learning. The effect of G(o) inhibition is distributed in both gamma- and alpha/beta-lobe mushroom body neurons. However, the expression of PTX in neurons adjacent to the mushroom bodies does not affect memory. PTX expression also does not interact genetically with a rutabaga adenylyl cyclase loss-of-function mutation. Thus, G(o) defines a new signaling pathway required in mushroom body neurons for the formation of associative memory.",2006,"Jacob Ferris, Hong Ge, Lingzhi Liu, Gregg Roman, Jacob Ferris, Hong Ge, Lingzhi Liu, Gregg Roman"
Nonstructural protein 3 of bluetongue virus assists virus release by recruiting ESCRT-I protein Tsg101,16352570,10.1128/JVI.80.1.460-473.2006,"The release of Bluetongue virus (BTV) and other members of the Orbivirus genus from infected host cells occurs predominantly by cell lysis, and in some cases, by budding from the plasma membrane. Two nonstructural proteins, NS3 and NS3A, have been implicated in this process. Here we show that both proteins bind to human Tsg101 and its ortholog from Drosophila melanogaster with similar strengths in vitro. This interaction is mediated by a conserved PSAP motif in NS3 and appears to play a role in virus release. The depletion of Tsg101 with small interfering RNA inhibits the release of BTV and African horse sickness virus, a related orbivirus, from HeLa cells up to fivefold and threefold, respectively. Like most other viral proteins which recruit Tsg101, NS3 also harbors a PPXY late-domain motif that allows NS3 to bind NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligases in vitro. However, the late-domain motifs in NS3 do not function as effectively in facilitating the release of mini Gag virus-like particles from 293T cells as the late domains from human immunodeficiency virus type 1, human T-cell leukemia virus, and Ebola virus. A mutagenesis study showed that the arginine residue in the PPRY motif is responsible for the low activity of the NS3 late-domain motifs. Our data suggest that the BTV late-domain motifs either recruit an antagonist that interferes with budding or fail to recruit an agonist which is different from NEDD4.",2006,"Christoph Wirblich, Bishnupriya Bhattacharya, Polly Roy, Christoph Wirblich, Bishnupriya Bhattacharya, Polly Roy"
"Nutrition, sirtuins and aging",18850202,10.1007/BF02829950,"Beyond our inherited genetic make-up environmental factors are central for health and disease and finally determine our life span. Amongst the environmental factors nutrition plays a prominent role in affecting a variety of degenerative processes that are linked to aging. The exponential increase of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in industrialized nations as a consequence of a long-lasting caloric supernutrition is an expression of this environmental challenge that also affects aging processes. The most consistent effects along the environmental factors that slow down aging - from simple organisms to rodents and primates - have been observed for caloric restriction. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sirtuins (silencing information regulators) have been identified to mediate as ""molecular sensors"" the effects of caloric restriction on aging processes. Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases that are activated when e.g. cell energy status is low and the NAD(+) over NADH ratio is high. As a consequence transcription rates of a variety of genes including that of the apoptosis inducing p(53) gene are reduced. Moreover, in C. elegans, sirtuins were shown to interact with proteins of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling cascade of which several members are known to extend life span of the nematodes when mutated. Downstream targets of this pathway include genes that encode antioxidative enzymes such as Superoxide dismutase (SOD) whose transcription is activated when receptor activation by insulin/IGF is low or when sirtuins are active and the ability of cells to resist oxidative damage appears to determine their life span. Amongst dietary factors that activate sirtuins are certain polyphenols such as quercetin and resveratrol. Whereas their ability to affect life span has been demonstrated in simple organisms, their efficacy in mammals awaits proof of principle.",2006,"Uwe Wenzel, Uwe Wenzel"
Actin capping protein alpha maintains vestigial-expressing cells within the Drosophila wing disc epithelium,16887822,10.1242/dev.02511,"Tissue patterning must be translated into morphogenesis through cell shape changes mediated by remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. We have found that Capping protein alpha (Cpa) and Capping protein beta (Cpb), which prevent extension of the barbed ends of actin filaments, are specifically required in the wing blade primordium of the Drosophila wing disc. cpa or cpb mutant cells in this region, but not in the remainder of the wing disc, are extruded from the epithelium and undergo apoptosis. Excessive actin filament polymerization is not sufficient to explain this phenotype, as loss of Cofilin or Cyclase-associated protein does not cause cell extrusion or death. Misexpression of Vestigial, the transcription factor that specifies the wing blade, both increases cpa transcription and makes cells dependent on cpa for their maintenance in the epithelium.

Remarkably, the centrosomal components, gamma-tubulin and Drosophila pericentrin-like protein also strongly accumulate at the periphery of this nucleus. MT polymerization after cold-induced disassembly in wild type and in gurken mutants suggests that in the oocyte the centrosome-nucleus complex is an active center of MT polymerization. We further report that the MT network comprises two perpendicular MT subsets that undergo dynamic rearrangements during oogenesis. This MT reorganization parallels the successive steps in localization of gurken and oskar mRNAs. We propose that in addition to a highly polarized microtubule scaffold specified by the cortex oocyte, the repositioning of the nucleus and its tightly associated centrosome could control MT reorganization and, hence, oocyte polarization.",2006,"Jens Januschke, Louis Gervais, Laurent Gillet, Guy Keryer, Michel Bornens, Antoine Guichet, Jens Januschke, Louis Gervais, Laurent Gillet, Guy Keryer, Michel Bornens, Antoine Guichet"
Role of hunchback in segment patterning of Locusta migratoria manilensis revealed by parental RNAi,16961591,10.1111/j.1440-169X.2006.00881.x,"In long germ embryos, all body segments are specified simultaneously during the blastoderm stage. In contrast, in short germ embryos, only the anterior segments are specified during the blastoderm stage, leaving the rest of the body plan to be specified later. The striking embryological differences between short and long germ segmentation imply fundamental differences in patterning at the molecular level. To gain insights into the segmentation mechanisms of short germ insects, we have investigated the role of the homologue of the Drosophila gap gene hunchback (hb) in a short germ insect Locusta migratoria manilensi by paternal RNA interference (RNAi). Phenotypes resulting from hb knockdown were categorized into three classes based on severity. In the most extreme case, embryos developed the most anterior structures only, including the labrum, antennae and eyes. The following conclusions were drawn: (i) L. migratoria manilensis hb (Lmm'hb) controls germ band morphogenesis and segmentation in the anterior region; (ii) Lmm'hb may function as a gap gene in a wide domain including the entire gnathum and thorax; and (iii) Lmm'hb is required for proper growth of the posterior germ band.

Both approaches converged on a novel protein that we call Orai1, which contains four putative transmembrane segments. The SCID patients are homozygous for a single missense mutation in ORAI1, and expression of wild-type Orai1 in SCID T cells restores store-operated Ca2+ influx and the CRAC current (I(CRAC)).

We observe a parallel cline in Australia for one of the two major length variants and find higher levels of some Thr-Gly length variants, particularly at the tropical latitudes, that are extremely rare in Europe. In addition we examined >40 haplotypes from sub-Saharan Africa and find a very different and far more variable profile of Thr-Gly sequences. Statistical analysis of the periodicity and codon content of the repeat from all three continents reveals a possible mechanism that may explain how the repeat initially arose in the ancestors of the D. melanogaster subgroup of species.

Engineering eukaryotic signal transduction with RNAi: enhancing Drosophila S2 cell growth and recombinant protein synthesis via silencing of TSC1,16955503,10.1002/bit.20951,"RNAi has been useful in the study of biochemical pathways, but has not been widely used as a tool in metabolic engineering. The work described here makes use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for the post-transcriptional gene silencing of TSC1 in Drosophila S2 cells. TSC1 downregulates the insulin-mediated signal transduction pathway, and serves as a metabolic control to guard against cellular overproliferation and tumorogenesis in both flies and mammals. By silencing TSC1 with in vitro-synthesized dsRNA, we have created a tunable and specific metabolic ""throttle"" that, like insulin, apparently increases the specific growth rate of S2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. This ""throttle,"" augments the benefits of insulin addition while apparently avoiding deleterious and pleiotropic effects which can lead to lysis. During the period wherein dsRNA was active, cell growth rate was increased by 11% by the addition of 15 microg/mL dsTSC1 and by over 20% by the addition of 30 microg/mL dsTSC1. Additionally, synthesis of recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) was increased nearly 50% in a stable S2 cell line inducibly expressing GFP. Accordingly, we have ""tuned"" a normally tumorogenic pathway in animals into an advantage for both growth and recombinant product synthesis in cell culture. Potential applications for improving eukaryotic cell culture are anticipated.",2006,"John C March, William E Bentley, John C March, William E Bentley"
Requirement of Akt to mediate long-term synaptic depression in Drosophila,16611817,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3616-05.2006,"Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well established preparation enabling quantitative analyses of synaptic physiology at identifiable synapses. Here, we report the first characterization of synaptic long-term depression (LTD) at the Drosophila NMJ. LTD can be reliably induced by specific patterns of tetanic stimulation, and the level of LTD depends on both stimulus frequency and Ca2+ concentration. We provide evidence that LTD is likely a result of presynaptic changes. Through screening of targeted mutants with defects in memory or signal transduction pathways, we found that LTD is strongly reduced in the akt mutants. This defect can be rescued by acutely induced expression of the normal akt transgene, suggesting that altered LTD is not attributable to developmental abnormalities and that Akt is critical for the induction of LTD. Our study also indicates that the molecular mechanisms of LTD are distinct from that of short-term synaptic plasticity, because akt mutants showed normal short-term facilitation and posttetanic potentiation, whereas LTD was unaffected in mutants that exhibit defective short-term synaptic plasticity, such as dunce and rutabaga. The characterization of LTD allows genetic analysis of the molecular mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity in Drosophila and provides an additional assay for studying functions of genes pertaining to synaptic and behavioral plasticity.",2006,"Hui-Fu Guo, Yi Zhong, Hui-Fu Guo, Yi Zhong"
Axis specification in the spider embryo: dpp is required for radial-to-axial symmetry transformation and sog for ventral patterning,16720876,10.1242/dev.02400,"The mechanism by which Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and its antagonist Short gastrulation (Sog) specify the dorsoventral pattern in Drosophila embryos has been proposed to have a common origin with the mechanism that organizes the body axis in the vertebrate embryo. However, Drosophila Sog makes only minor contributions to the development of ventral structures that hypothetically correspond to the vertebrate dorsum where the axial notochord forms. In this study, we isolated a homologue of the Drosophila sog gene in the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum, and characterized its expression and function. Expression of sog mRNA initially appeared in a radially symmetrical pattern and later became confined to the ventral midline area, which runs axially through the germ band. RNA interference-mediated depletion of the spider sog gene led to a nearly complete loss of ventral structures, including the axial ventral midline and the central nervous system. This defect appeared to be the consequence of dorsalization of the ventral region of the germ band. By contrast, the extra-embryonic area formed normally. Furthermore, we showed that embryos depleted for a spider homologue of dpp failed to break the radial symmetry, displaying evenly high levels of sog expression except in the posterior terminal area. These results suggest that dpp is required for radial-to-axial symmetry transformation of the spider embryo and sog is required for ventral patterning. We propose that the mechanism of spider ventral specification largely differs from that of the fly. Interestingly, ventral specification in the spider is similar to the process in vertebrates in which the antagonism of Dpp/BMP signaling plays a central role in dorsal specification.",2006,"Yasuko Akiyama-Oda, Hiroki Oda, Yasuko Akiyama-Oda, Hiroki Oda"

The first experiment evaluates the efficacy of the laboratory model system to study interlocus sexual conflict by comparing remating rates of females when they are, or are not, provided with a spatial refuge from persistent male courtship. The second experiment tests for a lag-load in males that is due to adaptations that have accumulated in females, which diminish male-induced harm while simultaneously interfering with a male's ability to compete in the context of sexual selection.

Increased male mating rate in Drosophila is associated with Wolbachia infection,17040394,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01143.x,"The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis infects 25-75% of arthropods and manipulates host reproduction to improve its transmission. One way Wolbachia achieves this is by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), where crosses between infected males and uninfected females are inviable. Infected males suffer reduced fertility through CI and reduced sperm production. However, Wolbachia induce lower levels of CI in nonvirgin males. We examined the impact of Wolbachia on mating behaviour in male Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, which display varying levels of CI, and show that infected males mate at a higher rate than uninfected males in both species. This may serve to increase the spread of Wolbachia, or alternatively, may be a behavioural adaptation employed by males to reduce the level of CI. Mating at high rate restores reproductive compatibility with uninfected females resulting in higher male reproductive success thus promoting male promiscuity. Increased male mating rates also have implications for the transmission of Wolbachia.",2006,"F E Champion de Crespigny, T D Pitt, N Wedell, F E Champion de Crespigny, T D Pitt, N Wedell"

Here, we show that the NFkappaB transcription factor Dorsal is a substrate of CRM1 and requires the nucleoporin Nup214 for its nuclear translocation upon signaling. Nup214 bound to CRM1 directly and anchored it to the nuclear envelope. In nup214 mutants CRM1 accumulated in the nucleus and NES-protein export was enhanced. Nup214 formed complexes with Nup88 and CRM1 in vivo and Nup214 protected Nup88 from degradation at the nuclear rim. In turn, Nup88 was sufficient for targeting the complex to the nuclear pores. Overexpression experiments indicated that Nup214 alone attracts a fraction of CRM1 to the nuclear envelope but does not interfere with NES-GFP export. By contrast, overexpression of the Nup214-Nup88 complex trapped CRM1 and Dorsal to cytoplasmic foci and inhibited protein export and immune response activation.

Thus, we evaluated melanoma cell lines and tissue samples of malignant melanoma for loss of Hugl-1 transcription. We found that Hugl-1 was downregulated or lost in all cell lines and in most of the tumor samples analysed, and that these losses were associated with advanced stage of the disease. Reduced Hugl-1 expression occurred as early as in primary tumors detected by both immunohistochemical and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Functional assays with stable Hugl-1-transfected cell lines revealed that Hugl-1 expression increased cell adhesion and decreased cell migration. Further, downregulation of MMP2 and MMP14 (MT1-MMP) and re-expression of E-cadherin was found in the Hugl-1-expressing cell clones supporting a role of Hugl-1 in EMT.

Based on its substrate specificity and expression in endothelial tissues, it is suggested that Hep27 functions as a dicarbonyl reductase in enzymatic inactivation of reactive carbonyls, involved in covalent modification of cellular components.",2006,"N Shafqat, J Shafqat, G Eissner, H-U Marschall, K Tryggvason, U Eriksson, F Gabrielli, H Lardy, H Jörnvall, U Oppermann, N Shafqat, J Shafqat, G Eissner, H-U Marschall, K Tryggvason, U Eriksson, F Gabrielli, H Lardy, H Jörnvall, U Oppermann"
Mammalian CLASP1 and CLASP2 cooperate to ensure mitotic fidelity by regulating spindle and kinetochore function,16914514,10.1091/mbc.e06-07-0579,"CLASPs are widely conserved microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins with essential roles in the local regulation of microtubule dynamics. In yeast, Drosophila, and Xenopus, a single CLASP orthologue is present, which is required for mitotic spindle assembly by regulating microtubule dynamics at the kinetochore. In mammals, however, only CLASP1 has been directly implicated in cell division, despite the existence of a second paralogue, CLASP2, whose mitotic roles remain unknown. Here, we show that CLASP2 localization at kinetochores, centrosomes, and spindle throughout mitosis is remarkably similar to CLASP1, both showing fast microtubule-independent turnover rates. Strikingly, primary fibroblasts from Clasp2 knockout mice show numerous spindle and chromosome segregation defects that can be partially rescued by ectopic expression of Clasp1 or Clasp2. Moreover, chromosome segregation rates during anaphase A and B are slower in Clasp2 knockout cells, which is consistent with a role of CLASP2 in the regulation of kinetochore and spindle function. Noteworthy, cell viability/proliferation and spindle checkpoint function were not impaired in Clasp2 knockout cells, but the fidelity of mitosis was strongly compromised, leading to severe chromosomal instability in adult cells. Together, our data support that the partial redundancy of CLASPs during mitosis acts as a possible mechanism to prevent aneuploidy in mammals.",2006,"Ana L Pereira, António J Pereira, Ana R R Maia, Ksenija Drabek, C Laura Sayas, Polla J Hergert, Mariana Lince-Faria, Irina Matos, Cristina Duque, Tatiana Stepanova, Conly L Rieder, William C Earnshaw, Niels Galjart, Helder Maiato, Ana L Pereira, António J Pereira, Ana R R Maia, Ksenija Drabek, C Laura Sayas, Polla J Hergert, Mariana Lince-Faria, Irina Matos, Cristina Duque, Tatiana Stepanova, Conly L Rieder, William C Earnshaw, Niels Galjart, Helder Maiato"
Molecular architecture of smell and taste in Drosophila,17506643,10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094306,"The chemical senses-smell and taste-allow animals to evaluate and distinguish valuable food resources from dangerous substances in the environment.

Neurophysiological experiments have begun to provide insight into the mechanisms by which these animals process chemosensory cues.

Lola regulates Drosophila olfactory projection neuron identity and targeting specificity,17634136,10.1186/1749-8104-2-14,"Background:
        
      
      Precise connections of neural circuits can be specified by genetic programming. In the Drosophila olfactory system, projection neurons (PNs) send dendrites to single glomeruli in the antenna lobe (AL) based upon lineage and birth order and send axons with stereotyped terminations to higher olfactory centers. These decisions are likely specified by a PN-intrinsic transcriptional code that regulates the expression of cell-surface molecules to instruct wiring specificity.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We find that the loss of longitudinals lacking (lola), which encodes a BTB-Zn-finger transcription factor with 20 predicted splice isoforms, results in wiring defects in both axons and dendrites of all lineages of PNs. RNA in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR suggest that most if not all lola isoforms are expressed in all PNs, but different isoforms are expressed at widely varying levels. Overexpression of individual lola isoforms fails to rescue the lola null phenotypes and causes additional phenotypes. Loss of lola also results in ectopic expression of Gal4 drivers in multiple cell types and in the loss of transcription factor gene lim1 expression in ventral PNs.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Our results indicate that lola is required for wiring of axons and dendrites of most PN classes, and suggest a need for its molecular diversity. Expression pattern changes of Gal4 drivers in lola-/- clones imply that lola normally represses the expression of these regulatory elements in a subset of the cells surrounding the AL. We propose that Lola functions as a general transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes ultimately controlling PN identity and wiring specificity.",2007,"Maria Lynn Spletter, Jian Liu, Justin Liu, Helen Su, Edward Giniger, Takaki Komiyama, Stephen Quake, Liqun Luo, Maria Lynn Spletter, Jian Liu, Justin Liu, Helen Su, Edward Giniger, Takaki Komiyama, Stephen Quake, Liqun Luo"
Drosophila melanogaster Parkin ubiquitinates peanut and septin1 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase,17456438,10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.01.007,"Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP), a common familial form of Parkinson's disease, is caused by mutations of human Parkin. To deepen the understanding of Parkin biology in an in vivo model of Drosophila, we attempted to characterize the function of Drosophila melanogaster Parkin and found that D. melanogaster Parkin exhibited UbcH8-dependent E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Using E2 binding and in vitro ubiquitination assays, UbcH8 preferentially was found to bind to Parkin mutants harboring functional RING1 domains, but failed to bind to mutants harboring point mutants with complete loss of function. This inability of UbcH8 binding to such mutants was accompanied by abrogation of an E3 ligase activity, indicating that D. melanogaster Parkin as an E3 ligase interacts with UbcH8 through its RING1 domain. An in vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that D. melanogaster Parkin existed in ubiquitinated form in vivo. Moreover, peanut and septin1, D. melanogaster septin proteins, were also ubiquitinated by D. melanogaster Parkin. Co-immunoprecipitation with membrane protein Syntaxin indicated direct binding of septin proteins to syntaxin, implicating their relevance in the exocytosis of dopamine in cells. Western blot analysis and DNA fragmentation indicated that the rate and efficiency of p53-dependent apoptosis were significantly higher in the presence of dopamine than without the septin proteins. Therefore, our findings in the present study demonstrate that Parkin possibly influences septin protein effects on p53-mediated apoptosis, helping to extend the utility of Drosophila as a model system for the study of neurodegeneration.",2007,"Young-Joo Bae, Soon-Ja Kang, Kwang Sook Park, Young-Joo Bae, Soon-Ja Kang, Kwang Sook Park"
Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet affects circadian photosensitivity and coordinates TIM and PER expression in Drosophila clock neurons,17229923,10.1177/0748730406295754,"Extraretinal photoreception is a common input route for light resetting signals into the circadian clock of animals. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial circadian light inputs are mediated via the blue light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) expressed in clock neurons within the brain. The current model predicts that, upon light activation, CRY interacts with the clock proteins TIMELESS (TIM) and PERIOD (PER), thereby inducing their degradation, which in turn leads to a resetting of the molecular oscillations within the circadian clock. Here the authors investigate the function of another putative extraretinal circadian photoreceptor, the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet (H-B eyelet), located between the retina and the medulla in the fly optic lobes. Blocking synaptic transmission between the H-B eyelet and its potential target cells, the ventral circadian pacemaker neurons, impaired the flies' ability to resynchronize their behavior under jet-lag conditions in the context of nonfunctional retinal photoreception and a mutation in the CRY-encoding gene. The same manipulation also affected synchronized expression of the clock proteins TIM and PER in different subsets of the clock neurons. This shows that synaptic communication between the H-B eyelet and clock neurons contributes to synchronization of molecular and behavioral rhythms and confirms that the H-B eyelet functions as a circadian photoreceptor. Blockage of synaptic transmission from the H-B eyelet in the presence of functional compound eyes and the absence of CRY also results in increased numbers of flies that are unable to synchronize to extreme photoperiods, supplying independent proof for the role of the H-B eyelet as a circadian photoreceptor.",2007,"Shobi Veleri, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Ralf Stanewsky, Shobi Veleri, Dirk Rieger, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Ralf Stanewsky"

Also, gcm-gcm2 are required for the differentiation of specific adult neurons. We here show that gcm is expressed in precursors and postmitotic, migrating, cells of the medulla neuropile glia (mng) lineage. It is also expressed in a thoracic glial lineage and in neurons of the ventral nerve cord (VNC).

A potential genomic biomarker for the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pollutants: multidrug resistance gene 49 in Drosophila melanogaster,17665681,10.1897/06-552r.1,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a major source of air, water, and soil pollution. The multidrug resistance (mdr)/permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) complex is implicated in the multidrug resistance pattern developed against various drugs and xenobiotics, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to develop a genomic biomarker, we investigated the response of the mdr49 gene (mdr49) of Drosophila melanogaster to PAHs. Structural analysis of mdr49-PA, which is the putative protein expressed from Drosophila mdr49 gene, demonstrated that this transmembrane protein indeed belongs to the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter superfamily. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR analysis revealed that the mdr49 gene is expressed continuously at all the stages of fly development, including embryos, pupae, larvae, and adults, as well as in embryonic Drosophila S12 cells. In the adult fly, the mdr49 gene was expressed in all the analyzed segments (head, thorax, and abdomen) and organs (olfactory and sexual organs). The quantification of mdr49 transcripts by real-time PCR in adult flies exposed to benzo[a]pyrene over time or in presence of increasing concentrations of this pollutant showed a clear dose-dependent response.

The lateral and dorsal neurons of Drosophila melanogaster: new insights about their morphology and function,18419311,10.1101/sqb.2007.72.063,"This chapter summarizes our present knowledge about the master clock of the fruit fly at the neuronal level. The clock is organized in distinct groups of interconnected pacemaker neurons with different functions. All of these neurons appear to communicate with one another in order to produce the species-specific activity rhythm, which is organized in morning (M) and evening (E) activity bouts. These two activity components are differentially influenced by distinct groups of pacemaker neurons reminiscent of the Pittendrigh-Daan dual oscillator model.

"Recognition of age-damaged (R,S)-adenosyl-L-methionine by two methyltransferases in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae",17264075,10.1074/jbc.M610029200,"The biological methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) can exist in two diastereoisomeric states with respect to its sulfonium ion. The S configuration, (S,S)-AdoMet, is the only form that is produced enzymatically as well as the only form used in almost all biological methylation reactions. Under physiological conditions, however, the sulfonium ion can spontaneously racemize to the R form, producing (R,S)-AdoMet. As of yet, (R,S)-AdoMet has no known physiological function and may inhibit cellular reactions. In this study, we found two Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes that are capable of recognizing (R,S)-AdoMet and using it to methylate homocysteine to form methionine. These enzymes are the products of the SAM4 and MHT1 genes, identified previously as homocysteine methyltransferases dependent upon AdoMet and S-methylmethionine, respectively. We found here that Sam4 recognizes both (S,S)- and (R,S)-AdoMet, but that its activity is much higher with the R,S form. Mht1 reacts with only the R,S form of AdoMet, whereas no activity is seen with the S,S form. R,S-Specific homocysteine methyltransferase activity is also shown here to occur in extracts of Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans, but has not been detected in several tissue extracts of Mus musculus.

Evolution of mitochondrial cell death pathway: Proapoptotic role of HtrA2/Omi in Drosophila,17397804,10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.079,"Despite the essential role of mitochondria in a variety of mammalian cell death processes, the involvement of mitochondrial pathway in Drosophila cell death has remained unclear. To address this, we cloned and characterized DmHtrA2, a Drosophila homolog of a mitochondrial serine protease HtrA2/Omi. We show that DmHtrA2 normally resides in mitochondria and is up-regulated by UV-irradiation. Upon receipt of apoptotic stimuli, DmHtrA2 is translocated to extramitochondrial compartment; however, unlike its mammalian counterpart, the extramitochondrial DmHtrA2 does not diffuse throughout the cytosol but stays near the mitochondria. RNAi-mediated knock-down of DmHtrA2 in larvae or adult flies results in a resistance to stress stimuli. DmHtrA2 specifically cleaves Drosophila inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1), a cellular caspase inhibitor, and induces cell death both in vitro and in vivo as potent as other fly cell death proteins.

RNA is an integral component of chromatin that contributes to its structural organization,18000552,10.1371/journal.pone.0001182,"Chromatin structure is influenced by multiples factors, such as pH, temperature, nature and concentration of counterions, post-translational modifications of histones and binding of structural non-histone proteins. RNA is also known to contribute to the regulation of chromatin structure as chromatin-induced gene silencing was shown to depend on the RNAi machinery in S. pombe, plants and Drosophila. Moreover, both in Drosophila and mammals, dosage compensation requires the contribution of specific non-coding RNAs. However, whether RNA itself plays a direct structural role in chromatin is not known. Here, we report results that indicate a general structural role for RNA in eukaryotic chromatin. RNA is found associated to purified chromatin prepared from chicken liver, or cultured Drosophila S2 cells, and treatment with RNase A alters the structural properties of chromatin. Our results indicate that chromatin-associated RNAs, which account for 2%-5% of total chromatin-associated nucleic acids, are polyA(-) and show a size similar to that of the DNA contained in the corresponding chromatin fragments. Chromatin-associated RNA(s) are not likely to correspond to nascent transcripts as they are also found bound to chromatin when cells are treated with alpha-amanitin. After treatment with RNase A, chromatin fragments of molecular weight >3.000 bp of DNA showed reduced sedimentation through sucrose gradients and increased sensitivity to micrococcal nuclease digestion.

Isolation and characterization of the Drosophila ubiquilin ortholog dUbqln: in vivo interaction with early-onset Alzheimer disease genes,17704509,10.1093/hmg/ddm219,"UBQLN1 variants have been associated with increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We produced transgenic Drosophila models that either silence (by RNAi) or overexpress the Drosophila ortholog of human UBQLN1, dUbqln. Silencing of dUbqln in the central nervous system led to age-dependent neurodegeneration and shortened lifespan. Silencing of dUbqln in the wing led to wing vein loss that could be partially rescued by mutant rhomboid (rho), a known component of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. Conversely, overexpression of dUbqln promoted ecotopic wing veins. Overexpression of dUbqln in the eye rescued a small, rough eye phenotype induced by overexpression of Drosophila presenilin (dPsn), and also rescuing dPsn-induced malformations in bristles. In contrast, RNAi silencing of dUbqln enhanced the retinal degenerative defect induced by overexpression of dPsn. Finally, co-overexpression of dUbqln and the human amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the eye significantly reduced the levels of full-length APP and its C-terminal fragment.

Analysis and reconstitution of the genetic cascade controlling early mesoderm morphogenesis in the Drosophila embryo,17267182,10.1016/j.mod.2006.12.004,"To understand how transcription factors direct developmental events, it is necessary to know their target or 'effector' genes whose products mediate the downstream cell biological events. Whereas loss of a single target may partially or fully recapitulate the phenotype of loss of the transcription factor, this does not mean that this target is the only direct mediator. For a complete understanding of the pathway it is necessary to identify the full set of targets that together are sufficient to carry out the programme initiated by the transcription factor, which has not yet been attempted for any pathway. In the case of the transcriptional activator Twist, which acts at the top of the mesodermal developmental cascade in Drosophila, two targets, Snail and Fog, are known to be necessary for the first morphogenetic event, the orderly invagination of the mesoderm. We use a system of reconstituting loss of Twist function by transgenes expressing Snail and Fog independently of Twist to analyse the sufficiency of these factors-a loss of function assay for additional gene functions to assess what further functions might be needed downstream of Twist. Confirming and extending previous studies, we show that Snail plays an essential role, allowing basic cell shape changes to take place. Fog and at least two other genes are needed to accelerate and coordinate shape changes.

Requirement of the LIM homeodomain transcription factor tailup for normal heart and hematopoietic organ formation in Drosophila melanogaster,17371844,10.1128/MCB.00093-07,"Dorsal vessel morphogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster serves as a superb system with which to study the cellular and genetic bases of heart tube formation. We used a cardioblast-expressed Toll-GFP transgene to screen for additional genes involved in heart development and identified tailup as a locus essential for normal dorsal vessel formation. tailup, related to vertebrate islet1, encodes a LIM homeodomain transcription factor expressed in all cardioblasts and pericardial cells of the heart tube as well as in associated lymph gland hematopoietic organs and alary muscles that attach the dorsal vessel to the epidermis. A transcriptional enhancer regulating expression in these four cell types was identified and used as a tailup-GFP transgene with additional markers to characterize dorsal vessel defects resulting from gene mutations. Two reproducible phenotypes were observed in mutant embryos: hypoplastic heart tubes with misaligned cardioblasts and the absence of most lymph gland and pericardial cells. Conversely, a significant expansion of the lymph glands and abnormal morphology of the heart were observed when tailup was overexpressed in the mesoderm. Tailup was shown to bind to two DNA recognition sequences in the dorsal vessel enhancer of the Hand basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene, with one site proven to be essential for the lymph gland, pericardial cell, and Svp/Doc cardioblast expression of Hand. Together, these results establish Tailup as being a critical new transcription factor in dorsal vessel morphogenesis and lymph gland formation and place this regulator directly upstream of Hand in these developmental processes.",2007,"Ye Tao, Jianbo Wang, Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Kathleen Gajewski, Robert A Schulz, Ye Tao, Jianbo Wang, Tsuyoshi Tokusumi, Kathleen Gajewski, Robert A Schulz"

The prototypic genetic capacitor, Hsp90, interfaces stress responses, developmental networks, trait thresholds and expression of wide-ranging morphological changes in Drosophila and other organisms. The Hsp90 capacitor hypothesis, that stress-sensitive storage and release of genetic variation through Hsp90 facilitates adaptive evolution in unpredictable environments, has been challenged by the belief that Hsp90-buffered variation is unconditionally deleterious. Here we review recent results supporting the Hsp90 capacitor hypothesis, highlighting the heritability, selectability, and potential evolvability of Hsp90-buffered traits. Despite a surprising bias toward morphological novelty and typically invariable quantitative traits, Hsp90-buffered changes are remarkably modular, and can be selected to high frequency independent of the expected negative side-effects or obvious correlated changes in other, unselected traits. Recent dissection of cryptic signal transduction variation involved in one Hsp90-buffered trait reveals potentially dozens of normally silent polymorphisms embedded in cell cycle, differentiation and growth control networks. Reduced function of Hsp90 substrates during environmental stress would destabilize robust developmental processes, relieve developmental constraints and plausibly enables genetic network remodeling by abundant cryptic alleles.

We demonstrate that molecular oscillator function and clock neuron output are normal in ebony mutants, verifying a role for Ebony downstream of the clock. Surprisingly, the ebony oscillation persists in flies lacking PDF neuropeptide, indicating it is regulated by an autonomous glial oscillator or another neuronal factor. The proximity of Ebony-containing glia to aminergic neurons and genetic interaction results suggest a function in dopaminergic signaling.

Free-flight odor tracking in Drosophila is consistent with an optimal intermittent scale-free search,17406678,10.1371/journal.pone.0000354,"During their trajectories in still air, fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) explore their landscape using a series of straight flight paths punctuated by rapid 90 degrees body-saccades [1]. Some saccades are triggered by visual expansion associated with collision avoidance. Yet many saccades are not triggered by visual cues, but rather appear spontaneously. Our analysis reveals that the control of these visually independent saccades and the flight intervals between them constitute an optimal scale-free active searching strategy. Two characteristics of mathematical optimality that are apparent during free-flight in Drosophila are inter-saccade interval lengths distributed according to an inverse square law, which does not vary across landscape scale, and 90 degrees saccade angles, which increase the likelihood that territory will be revisited and thereby reduce the likelihood that near-by targets will be missed. We also show that searching is intermittent, such that active searching phases randomly alternate with relocation phases. Behaviorally, this intermittency is reflected in frequently occurring short, slow speed inter-saccade intervals randomly alternating with rarer, longer, faster inter-saccade intervals. Searching patterns that scale similarly across orders of magnitude of length (i.e., scale-free) have been revealed in animals as diverse as microzooplankton, bumblebees, albatrosses, and spider monkeys, but these do not appear to be optimised with respect to turning angle, whereas Drosophila free-flight search does. Also, intermittent searching patterns, such as those reported here for Drosophila, have been observed in foragers such as planktivorous fish and ground foraging birds. Our results with freely flying Drosophila may constitute the first reported example of searching behaviour that is both scale-free and intermittent.",2007,"Andy M Reynolds, Mark A Frye, Andy M Reynolds, Mark A Frye"
Sensory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe increases reliability and separability of ensemble odor representations,17922008,10.1038/nn1976,"Here we describe several fundamental principles of olfactory processing in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe (the analog of the vertebrate olfactory bulb), through the systematic analysis of input and output spike trains of seven identified glomeruli. Repeated presentations of the same odor elicit more reproducible responses in second-order projection neurons (PNs) than in their presynaptic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). PN responses rise and accommodate rapidly, emphasizing odor onset. Furthermore, weak ORN inputs are amplified in the PN layer but strong inputs are not. This nonlinear transformation broadens PN tuning and produces more uniform distances between odor representations in PN coding space. In addition, portions of the odor response profile of a PN are not systematically related to their direct ORN inputs, which probably indicates the presence of lateral connections between glomeruli. Finally, we show that a linear discriminator classifies odors more accurately using PN spike trains than using an equivalent number of ORN spike trains.",2007,"Vikas Bhandawat, Shawn R Olsen, Nathan W Gouwens, Michelle L Schlief, Rachel I Wilson, Vikas Bhandawat, Shawn R Olsen, Nathan W Gouwens, Michelle L Schlief, Rachel I Wilson"
Stable expression of human growth hormone over 50 generations in transgenic insect larvae,17103025,10.1007/s11248-006-9032-4,"Developments in insect transgenesis using transposons combined with available mass rearing technology for insects such as the Medfly, Ceratitis capitata, provide opportunity for the production of protein for industrial, agricultural and healthcare purposes on a very large scale. In this study, we report the germ-line transformation and expression of a cDNA encoding human growth hormone (hGH) in transgenic Drosophila using the Minos transposon. Production and secretion of a bioactive hGH into the haemolymph of transgenic larvae was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis, ELISA and a proliferation bioassay.

Structure and dynamics of LC8 complexes with KXTQT-motif peptides: swallow and dynein intermediate chain compete for a common site,17570393,10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.046,"The dynein light chain LC8 is an integral subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex that binds directly to and promotes assembly of the dynein intermediate chain (IC). LC8 interacts also with a variety of putative dynein cargo molecules such as Bim, a proapoptotic Bcl2 family protein, which have the KXTQT recognition sequence and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which has the GIQVD fingerprint but shares the same binding grooves at the LC8 dimer interface. The work reported here investigates the interaction of LC8 with IC and a putative cargo, Swallow, which share the KXTQT recognition sequence, and addresses the apparent paradox of how LC8, as part of dynein, mediates binding to cargo. The structures of Drosophila LC8 bound to peptides from IC and Swallow solved by X-ray diffraction show that the IC and Swallow peptides bind in the same grooves at the dimer interface. Differences in flexibility between bound and free LC8 were evaluated from hydrogen isotope exchange experiments using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Peptide binding causes an increase in protection from exchange primarily in residues that interact directly with the peptide, such as the beta-strand intertwined at the interface and the N-terminal end of helix alpha2. There is considerably more protection upon Swallow binding, consistent with tighter binding relative to IC. Comparison with the LC8/nNOS complex shows how both the GIQVD and KXTQT fingerprints are recognized in the same groove. The similar structures of LC8/IC and LC8/Swa and the tighter binding of Swallow call into question the role for LC8 as a cargo adaptor protein, and suggest that binding of LC8 to Swallow serves another function, possibly that of a dimerization engine, which is independent of its role in dynein.",2007,"Gregory Benison, P Andrew Karplus, Elisar Barbar, Gregory Benison, P Andrew Karplus, Elisar Barbar"
Putative circadian pacemaker cells in the antenna of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta,17786482,10.1007/s00441-007-0471-x,"Antennal sensory neurons in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster express circadian rhythms in the clock gene PERIOD (PER) and appear to be sufficient and necessary for circadian rhythms in olfactory responses. Given recent evidence for daily rhythms of pheromone responses in the antenna of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, we examined whether a peripheral PER-based circadian clock might be present in this species. Several different cell types in the moth antenna were recognized by monoclonal antibodies against Manduca sexta PER. In addition to PER-like staining of pheromone-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons and supporting cells, immunoreactivity was detected in beaded branches contacting the pheromone-sensitive sensilla. The nuclei of apparently all sensory receptor neurons, of sensilla supporting cells, of epithelial cells, and of antennal nerve glial cells were PER-immunoreactive. Expression of per mRNA in antennae was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction, which showed stronger expression at Zeitgeber-time 15 compared with Zeitgeber-time 3.

Sex-specific expression of a HOX gene associated with rapid morphological evolution,17868668,10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.07.030,"Animal diversity is shaped by the origin and diversification of new morphological structures. Many examples of evolutionary innovations are provided by male-specific traits involved in mating and sexual selection. The origin of new sex-specific characters requires the evolution of new regulatory interactions between sex-determining genes and genes that control spatial patterning and cell differentiation. Here, we show that sex-specific regulation of the HOX gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) is associated with the origin and evolution of the Drosophila sex comb - a novel and rapidly diversifying male-specific organ. In species that primitively lack sex combs, Scr expression shows little spatial modulation, whereas in species that have sex combs, Scr is upregulated in the presumptive sex comb region and is frequently sexually dimorphic. Phylogenetic analysis shows that sex-specific regulation of Scr has been gained and lost multiple times in Drosophila evolution and correlates with convergent origin of similar sex comb morphologies in several independent lineages. Some of these transitions occurred on microevolutionary timescales, indicating that HOX gene expression can evolve with surprising ease. This is the first example of a sex-specific regulation of a HOX gene contributing to the development and evolution of a secondary sexual trait.",2007,"Olga Barmina, Artyom Kopp, Olga Barmina, Artyom Kopp"

To date, enzymatic activity has only been demonstrated for the human XT-I, Caenorhabditis SQV-6, and Drosophila OXT isoforms. In the present study, we demonstrate that a soluble form of human XT-II expressed in the xylosyltransferase-deficient pgsA-745 (S745) Chinese hamster ovary cell line is indeed capable of catalyzing the transfer of xylose to a variety of peptide substrates; its enzyme activity was also proven using a Pichia-expressed form of XT-II.

Intracellular targeting of telomeric retrotransposon Gag proteins of distantly related Drosophila species,17483480,10.1073/pnas.0702566104,"The retrotransposons that maintain telomeres in Drosophila melanogaster have unique features that are shared across all Drosophila species but are not found in other retrotransposons. Comparative analysis of these features provides insight into their importance for telomere maintenance in Drosophila. Gag proteins encoded by HeT-A(mel) and TART(mel) are efficiently and cooperatively targeted to telomeres in interphase nuclei, a behavior that may facilitate telomere-specific transposition. Drosophila virilis, separated from D. melanogaster by 60 MY, has telomeres maintained by HeT-A(vir) and TART(vir). The Gag proteins from HeT-A(mel) and HeT-A(vir) have only 16% amino acid identity, yet several of their functional features are conserved. Using transient transfection of cultured cells from both species, we show that the telomere association of HeT-A(vir) Gag is indistinguishable from that of HeT-A(mel) Gag. Deletion derivatives show that organization of localization signals within the two proteins is strikingly similar. Gag proteins of TART(mel) and TART(vir) are only 13% identical. In contrast to HeT-A, surprisingly, TART(vir) Gag does not localize to the nucleus, although TART(vir) is a major component of D. virilis telomeres, and localization signals in the protein have much the same organization as in TART(mel) Gag. Thus, the mechanism of telomere targeting of TART(vir) differs, at least in a minor way, from that of TART(mel). Our findings suggest that, despite dramatic rates of protein evolution, protein and cellular determinants that correctly localize these Gag proteins have been conserved throughout the 60 MY separating these species.",2007,"Elena Casacuberta, Fernando Azorín Marín, Mary-Lou Pardue, Elena Casacuberta, Fernando Azorín Marín, Mary-Lou Pardue"

Sorting of Drosophila small silencing RNAs,17662944,10.1016/j.cell.2007.05.057,"In Drosophila, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which direct RNA interference through the Argonaute protein Ago2, are produced by a biogenesis pathway distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate endogenous mRNA expression as guides for Ago1. Here, we report that siRNAs and miRNAs are sorted into Ago1 and Ago2 by pathways independent from the processes that produce these two classes of small RNAs. Such small-RNA sorting reflects the structure of the double-stranded assembly intermediates--the miRNA/miRNA( *) and siRNA duplexes--from which Argonaute proteins are loaded. We find that the Dcr-2/R2D2 heterodimer acts as a gatekeeper for the assembly of Ago2 complexes, promoting the incorporation of siRNAs and disfavoring miRNAs as loading substrates for Drosophila Ago2. A separate mechanism acts in parallel to favor miRNA/miRNA( *) duplexes and exclude siRNAs from assembly into Ago1 complexes. Thus, in flies small-RNA duplexes are actively sorted into Argonaute-containing complexes according to their intrinsic structures.",2007,"Yukihide Tomari, Tingting Du, Phillip D Zamore, Yukihide Tomari, Tingting Du, Phillip D Zamore"
Intersectin enhances huntingtin aggregation and neurodegeneration through activation of c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase,17550941,10.1093/hmg/ddm134,"Huntingon's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease arising from expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the protein huntingtin (Htt) resulting in aggregation of mutant Htt into nuclear and/or cytosolic inclusions in neurons. Mutant Htt affects multiple processes including protein degradation, transcription, signal transduction, fast axonal transport and endocytosis [reviewed in Ross, C.A. and Poirier, M.A. (2005) Opinion: what is the role of protein aggregation in neurodegeneration? Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol., 6, 891-898]. Here, we report that the endocytic and signal transduction scaffold intersectin (ITSN) increased aggregate formation by mutant Htt through activation of the c-Jun-NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)-MAPK pathway. Conversely, silencing ITSN or inhibiting JNK attenuated aggregate formation. Using a Drosophila model for polyQ repeat disease, we observed that ITSN enhanced polyQ-mediated neurotoxicity. A reciprocal relationship was observed between ITSN and Htt. While ITSN enhanced Htt aggregation and toxicity, Htt, in turn, inhibited the cooperativity between ITSN and the epidermal growth factor receptor signal transduction pathway. Finally, we observed that ITSN overexpression enhanced aggregation of polyQ-expanded androgen receptor (AR) as well as wild-type versions of both Htt and AR suggesting a broader involvement of ITSN in neurodegenerative diseases through destabilization of polyQ-containing proteins.",2007,"Erica Scappini, Tong-Wey Koh, Negin P Martin, John P O'Bryan, Erica Scappini, Tong-Wey Koh, Negin P Martin, John P O'Bryan"
A wave of EGFR signaling determines cell alignment and intercalation in the Drosophila tracheal placode,17978004,10.1242/dev.010397,"Invagination of organ placodes converts flat epithelia into three-dimensional organs. Cell tracing in the Drosophila tracheal placode revealed that, in the 30-minute period before invagination, cells enter mitotic quiescence and form short rows that encircle the future invagination site. The cells in the rows align to form a smooth boundary (;boundary smoothing'), accompanied by a transient increase in myosin at the boundary and cell intercalation oriented in parallel with the cellular rows. Cells then undergo apical constriction and invaginate, followed by radially oriented mitosis in the placode. Prior to invagination, ERK MAP kinase is activated in an outward circular wave, with the wave front often correlating with the smoothing cell boundaries. EGFR signaling is required for myosin accumulation and cell boundary smoothing, suggesting its propagation polarizes the planar cell rearrangement in the tracheal placode, and coordinates the timing and position of intrinsic cell internalization activities.",2007,"Mayuko Nishimura, Yoshiko Inoue, Shigeo Hayashi, Mayuko Nishimura, Yoshiko Inoue, Shigeo Hayashi"
"Drosophila Spd-2 recruits PCM to the sperm centriole, but is dispensable for centriole duplication",17919907,10.1016/j.cub.2007.08.065,"In C. elegans, genome-wide screens have identified just five essential centriole-duplication factors: SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-5, SAS-6, and SAS-4 [1-8]. These proteins are widely believed to comprise a conserved core duplication module [3, 9-14]. In worm embryos, SPD-2 is the most upstream component of this module, and it is also essential for pericentriolar material (PCM) recruitment to the centrioles [1, 4, 15, 16]. Here, we show that Drosophila Spd-2 (DSpd-2) is a component of both the centrioles and the PCM and has a role in recruiting PCM to the centrioles. DSpd-2 appears not, however, to be essential for centriole duplication in somatic cells. Moreover, PCM recruitment in DSpd-2 mutant somatic cells is only partially compromised, and mitosis appears unperturbed. In contrast, DSpd-2 is essential for proper PCM recruitment to the fertilizing sperm centriole, and hence for microtubule nucleation and pronuclear fusion. DSpd-2 therefore appears to have a particularly important role in recruiting PCM to the sperm centriole. We speculate that the SPD-2 family of proteins might only be absolutely essential for the recruitment of centriole duplication factors and PCM to the centriole(s) that enter the egg with the fertilizing sperm.",2007,"Carly I Dix, Jordan W Raff, Carly I Dix, Jordan W Raff"

Using a high throughput RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, we have identified a new protein (Spindly) that accumulates on unattached kinetochores and is required for silencing the SAC. After the depletion of Spindly, dynein cannot target to kinetochores, and, as a result, cells arrest in metaphase with high levels of kinetochore-bound Mad2 and RZZ. We also identified a human homologue of Spindly that serves a similar function. However, dynein's nonkinetochore functions are unaffected by Spindly depletion. Our findings indicate that Spindly is a novel regulator of mitotic dynein, functioning specifically to target dynein to kinetochores.",2007,"Eric R Griffis, Nico Stuurman, Ronald D Vale, Eric R Griffis, Nico Stuurman, Ronald D Vale"

We detected micrometastases in 15.8% of ovarioles from wild type host females 12 days after transplanting lgl tumor cells into their abdominal cavities.

We found that nearly all lgl micrometastases co-express the neuronal cell marker, ELAV, and the glial cell marker, REPO. These markers are not co-expressed in normal brain cells nor in tumorous brain cells. This indicates deregulated gene expression in these metastatic cells.

During AA withdrawal, JNK is activated and induces the expression of SNAT2 in L6 myotubes by stimulating an intronic nutrient-sensitive domain. A sensor for large neutral AA (e.g. Tyr, Gln) inhibits JNK activation and SNAT2 up-regulation. Additionally, shRNA and transporter chimeras demonstrate that SNAT2 provides a repressive signal for gene transcription during AA sufficiency, thus echoing AA sensing by transceptor (transporter-receptor) orthologues in yeast (Gap1/Ssy1) and Drosophila (PATH).

Drosophila melanogaster as a model for studying protein-encoding genes that are resident in constitutive heterochromatin,17080025,10.1038/sj.hdy.6800877,"The organization of chromosomes into euchromatin and heterochromatin is one of the most enigmatic aspects of genome evolution. For a long time, heterochromatin was considered to be a genomic wasteland, incompatible with gene expression. However, recent studies--primarily conducted in Drosophila melanogaster--have shown that this peculiar genomic component performs important cellular functions and carries essential genes. New research on the molecular organization, function and evolution of heterochromatin has been facilitated by the sequencing and annotation of heterochromatic DNA. About 450 predicted genes have been identified in the heterochromatin of D. melanogaster, indicating that the number of active genes is higher than had been suggested by genetic analysis. Most of the essential genes are still unknown at the molecular level, and a detailed functional analysis of the predicted genes is difficult owing to the lack of mutant alleles. Far from being a peculiarity of Drosophila, heterochromatic genes have also been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as in humans. The presence of expressed genes in heterochromatin seems paradoxical because they appear to function in an environment that has been considered incompatible with gene expression.

G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 is required for rhythmic olfactory responses in Drosophila,18499458,10.1016/j.cub.2008.04.062,"Background:
        
      
      The Drosophila circadian clock controls rhythms in the amplitude of odor-induced electrophysiological responses that peak during the middle of night. These rhythms are dependent on clocks in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), suggesting that odorant receptors (ORs) or OR-dependent processes are under clock control. Because responses to odors are initiated by heteromeric OR complexes that form odor-gated and cyclic-nucleotide-activated cation channels, we tested whether regulators of ORs were under circadian-clock control.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The levels of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2) messenger RNA and protein cycle in a circadian-clock-dependent manner with a peak around the middle of the night in antennae. Gprk2 overexpression in OSNs from wild-type or cyc(01) flies elicits constant high-amplitude electroantennogram (EAG) responses to ethyl acetate, whereas Gprk2 mutants produce constant low-amplitude EAG responses. ORs accumulate to high levels in the dendrites of OSNs around the middle of the night, and this dendritic localization of ORs is enhanced by GPRK2 overexpression at times when ORs are primarily localized in the cell body.

      These results support a model in which circadian-clock-dependent rhythms in GPRK2 abundance control the rhythmic accumulation of ORs in OSN dendrites, which in turn control rhythms in olfactory responses. The enhancement of OR function by GPRK2 contrasts with the traditional role of GPRKs in desensitizing activated receptors and suggests that GPRK2 functions through a fundamentally different mechanism to modulate OR activity.",2008,"Shintaro Tanoue, Parthasarathy Krishnan, Abhishek Chatterjee, Paul E Hardin, Shintaro Tanoue, Parthasarathy Krishnan, Abhishek Chatterjee, Paul E Hardin"

Many studies suggested that D. melanogaster has a smaller effective population size than D. simulans. As most evidence was derived from non-African populations, we readdressed this question by sequencing 10 X-linked loci in five African D. simulans and six African D. melanogaster populations. Contrary to previous results, we found no evidence for higher variability, and thus larger effective population size, in D. simulans. Our observation of similar levels of variability of both species will have important implications for the interpretation of patterns of molecular evolution.",2008,"Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer, Viola Nolte, Christian Schlötterer"
Structure-function analysis of the RNA helicase maleless,18086708,10.1093/nar/gkm1108,"Loss of function of the RNA helicase maleless (MLE) in Drosophila melanogaster leads to male-specific lethality due to a failure of X chromosome dosage compensation. MLE is presumably involved in incorporating the non-coding roX RNA into the dosage compensation complex (DCC), which is an essential but poorly understood requirement for faithful targeting of the complex to the X chromosome. Sequence comparison predicts several RNA-binding domains in MLE but their properties have not been experimentally verified. We evaluated the RNA-binding characteristics of these conserved motifs and their contributions to RNA-stimulated ATPase activity, to helicase activity, as well as to the targeting of MLE to the nucleus and to the X chromosome territory. We find that RB2 is the dominant, conditional RNA-binding module, which is indispensable for ATPase and helicase activity whereas the N-terminal RB1 motif does not bind RNA, but is involved in targeting MLE to the X chromosome. The C-terminal domain containing a glycine-rich heptad repeat adds potential dimerization and RNA-binding surfaces which are not required for helicase activity.",2008,"Annalisa Izzo, Catherine Regnard, Violette Morales, Elisabeth Kremmer, Peter B Becker, Annalisa Izzo, Catherine Regnard, Violette Morales, Elisabeth Kremmer, Peter B Becker"
Evidence for postsynaptic modulation of muscle contraction by a Drosophila neuropeptide,18394755,10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.013,"DPKQDFMRFamide, the most abundant FMRFamide-like peptide in Drosophila melanogaster, has been shown previously to enhance contractions of larval body wall muscles elicited by nerve stimulation and to increase excitatory junction potentials (EJPs). The present work investigated the possibility that this peptide can also stimulate muscle contraction by a direct action on muscle fibers. DPKQDFMRFamide induced slow contractions and increased tonus in body wall muscles of Drosophila larvae from which the central nervous system had been removed. The threshold for this effect was approximately 10(-8)M. The increase in tonus persisted in the presence of 7x10(-3)M glutamate, which desensitized postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Thus, the effect on tonus could not be explained by enhanced release of glutamate from synaptic terminals and, thus, may represent a postsynaptic effect. The effect on tonus was abolished in calcium-free saline and by treatment with L-type calcium channel blockers, nifedipine and nicardipine, but not by T-type blockers, amiloride and flunarizine. The present results provide evidence that this Drosophila peptide can act postsynaptically in addition to its apparent presynaptic effects, and that the postsynaptic effect requires influx through L-type calcium channels.",2008,"Julie Clark, Maja Milakovic, Amanda Cull, Markus K Klose, A Joffre Mercier, Julie Clark, Maja Milakovic, Amanda Cull, Markus K Klose, A Joffre Mercier"

In this report we set out to determine the respective contributions that each gene makes to the development of the fly retina. Here we demonstrate that both eyg and toe encode transcriptional repressors, are expressed in identical patterns but at significantly different levels.

Evolution of the insect Sox genes,18439299,10.1186/1471-2148-8-120,"Background:
        
      
      The Sox gene family of transcriptional regulators have essential roles during development and have been extensively studied in vertebrates. The mouse, human and fugu genomes contain at least 20 Sox genes, which are subdivided into groups based on sequence similarity of the highly conserved HMG domain. In the well-studied insect Drosophila melanogaster, eight Sox genes have been identified and are involved in processes such as neurogenesis, dorsal-ventral patterning and segmentation.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We examined the available genome sequences of Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis, Tribolium castaneum, Anopheles gambiae and identified Sox family members which were classified by phylogenetics using the HMG domains. Using in situ hybridisation we determined the expression patterns of eight honeybee Sox genes in honeybee embryo, adult brain and queen ovary. AmSoxB group genes were expressed in the nervous system, brain and Malphigian tubules. The restricted localization of AmSox21b and AmSoxB1 mRNAs within the oocyte, suggested a role in, or that they are regulated by, dorsal-ventral patterning. AmSoxC, D and F were expressed ubiquitously in late embryos and in the follicle cells of the queen ovary. Expression of AmSoxF and two AmSoxE genes was detected in the drone testis.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Insect genomes contain between eight and nine Sox genes, with at least four members belonging to Sox group B and other Sox subgroups each being represented by a single Sox gene. Hymenopteran insects have an additional SoxE gene, which may have arisen by gene duplication. Expression analyses of honeybee SoxB genes implies that this group of genes may be able to rapidly evolve new functions and expression domains, while the combined expression pattern of all the SoxB genes is maintained.",2008,"Megan J Wilson, Peter K Dearden, Megan J Wilson, Peter K Dearden"

The mis-expression effect from string was analysed using timed over expression during adult ES-organ and, for comparison, embryonic Chordotonal (Ch) organ formation. Surprisingly, string mis-expression prior to SOP division gave the greatest effect in both systems. In adult ES-organs, this lead to cell fate transformations producing structural cells, whilst in the embryo organs were lost, hence differences within the lineages exist.

Comparison of unwounded wild-type and serpent mutant embryos also shows a portfolio of 'macrophage-specific' genes, which suggest analogous functions with vertebrate inflammatory cells.

D1 receptor activation in the mushroom bodies rescues sleep-loss-induced learning impairments in Drosophila,18674913,10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.028,"Background:
        
      
      Extended wakefulness disrupts acquisition of short-term memories in mammals. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by extended waking and restored by sleep are unknown. Moreover, the neuronal circuits that depend on sleep for optimal learning remain unidentified.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Learning was evaluated with aversive phototaxic suppression. In this task, flies learn to avoid light that is paired with an aversive stimulus (quinine-humidity). We demonstrate extensive homology in sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairment between flies and humans. Both 6 hr and 12 hr of sleep deprivation are sufficient to impair learning in Canton-S (Cs) flies. Moreover, learning is impaired at the end of the normal waking day in direct correlation with time spent awake. Mechanistic studies indicate that this task requires intact mushroom bodies (MBs) and requires the dopamine D1-like receptor (dDA1). Importantly, sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairments could be rescued by targeted gene expression of the dDA1 receptor to the MBs.

"SNF4Agamma, the Drosophila AMPK gamma subunit is required for regulation of developmental and stress-induced autophagy",18285699,10.4161/auto.5719,"In holometabolous insects including Drosophila melanogaster a wave of autophagy triggered by 20-hydroxyecdysone is observed in the larval tissues during the third larval stage of metamorphosis. We used this model system to study the genetic regulation of autophagy. We performed a genetic screen to select P-element insertions that affect autophagy in the larval fat body. Light and electron microscopy of one of the isolated mutants (l(3)S005042) revealed the absence of autophagic vesicles in their fat body cells during the third larval stage. We show that formation of autophagic vesicles cannot be induced by 20-hydroxyecdysone in the tissues of mutant flies and represent evidence demonstrating that the failure to form autophagic vesicles is due to the insertion of a P-element into the gene coding SNF4Agamma, the Drosophila homologue of the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) gamma subunit. The ability to form autophagic vesicles (wild-type phenotype) can be restored by remobilization of the P-element in the mutant. Silencing of SNF4Agamma by RNAi suppresses autophagic vesicle formation in wild-type flies. We raised an antibody against SNF4Agamma and showed that this gene product is constitutively present in the wild-type larval tissues during postembryonal development. SNF4Agamma is nearly absent from the cells of homozygous mutants. SNF4Agamma translocates into the nuclei of fat body cells at the onset of the wandering stage concurrently with the beginning of the autophagic process.

"Bombyx small RNAs: genomic defense system against transposons in the silkworm, Bombyx mori",18801438,10.1016/j.ibmb.2008.03.007,"Selfish genetic elements called transposons can insert themselves at new locations in host genomes to modify gene structure and alter gene expression. Expansion of transposons can occur when novel transposition events are transmitted to subsequent generations after germline hopping. Therefore, organisms seem likely to have evolved defense mechanisms to silence transposons in the germline. Recently, small RNAs interacting with Piwi proteins (piwi-interacting RNAs: piRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in genomic defense mechanism against transposons. Here, we show that piRNA-like small RNAs are present abundantly in the Bombyx ovary. We cloned 38,493 kinds of Bombyx small RNA from the ovary and performed functional characterization. Bombyx small RNAs showed a unimodal length distribution with a peak at 28nt and a strong bias for U at the 5' end. We found that 12,869 kinds of Bombyx small RNAs were associated with transposons or repetitive sequences. We classified them as repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs), a subclass of piRNAs. Notably, antisense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward U at 5' ends; in contrast, sense rasiRNAs have a strong bias toward A at nucleotide position 10, indicating that the piRNA amplification loop proposed in Drosophila is evolutionarily conserved in Bombyx.

The BAC libraries comprise 8,000 to 12,500 clones for each species, estimated to cover the most of the genomes. We sequenced both ends of most of these BAC clones with a success rate of 91%. Of these, 53,701 clones consisting of non-repetitive BAC end sequences (BESs) were mapped with reference of the public D. melanogaster genome sequences.

Jak/Stat signalling in niche support cells regulates dpp transcription to control germline stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila ovary,18171682,10.1242/dev.016121,"The existence of specialised regulatory microenvironments or niches that sustain stable stem cell populations is well documented in many tissues. However, the specific mechanisms by which niche support (or stromal) cells govern stem cell maintenance remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that removal of the Jak/Stat pathway in support cells of the Drosophila ovarian niche leads to germline stem cell loss by differentiation. Conversely, ectopic Jak/Stat activation in support cells induces stem cell tumours, implying the presence of a signal relay between the stromal compartment and the stem cell population. We further show that ectopic Jak/Stat signalling in support cells augments dpp mRNA levels and increases the range of Dpp signalling, a Bmp2 orthologue known to act as a niche extrinsic factor required for female germline stem cell survival and division. Our results provide strong evidence for a model in which Jak/Stat signalling in somatic support cells regulates dpp transcription to define niche size and to maintain the adjacent germline stem cells in an undifferentiated state.",2008,"Lourdes López-Onieva, Ana Fernández-Miñán, Acaimo González-Reyes, Lourdes López-Onieva, Ana Fernández-Miñán, Acaimo González-Reyes"
A transgenic Drosophila model demonstrates that the Helicobacter pylori CagA protein functions as a eukaryotic Gab adaptor,18483552,10.1371/journal.ppat.1000064,"Infection with the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is associated with a spectrum of diseases including gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) protein of H. pylori, which is translocated into host cells via a type IV secretion system, is a major risk factor for disease development. Experiments in gastric tissue culture cells have shown that once translocated, CagA activates the phosphatase SHP-2, which is a component of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways whose over-activation is associated with cancer formation. Based on CagA's ability to activate SHP-2, it has been proposed that CagA functions as a prokaryotic mimic of the eukaryotic Grb2-associated binder (Gab) adaptor protein, which normally activates SHP-2. We have developed a transgenic Drosophila model to test this hypothesis by investigating whether CagA can function in a well-characterized Gab-dependent process: the specification of photoreceptors cells in the Drosophila eye. We demonstrate that CagA expression is sufficient to rescue photoreceptor development in the absence of the Drosophila Gab homologue, Daughter of Sevenless (DOS). Furthermore, CagA's ability to promote photoreceptor development requires the SHP-2 phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW). These results provide the first demonstration that CagA functions as a Gab protein within the tissue of an organism and provide insight into CagA's oncogenic potential. Since many translocated bacterial proteins target highly conserved eukaryotic cellular processes, such as the RTK signaling pathway, the transgenic Drosophila model should be of general use for testing the in vivo function of bacterial effector proteins and for identifying the host genes through which they function.",2008,"Crystal M Botham, Anica M Wandler, Karen Guillemin, Crystal M Botham, Anica M Wandler, Karen Guillemin"

Geographically distinct host populations often experience very different ecological conditions. These variable ecological conditions impact the strength of selection that these hosts experience from their parasites. 2. Numerous studies have characterized geographical patterns of resistance to infection among natural populations in the context of host-parasite local adaptation, but what other factors might contribute to these differences? 3. Here, we determined whether 20 naturally isolated populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected along the East Coast of the United States varied for survival after being inoculated with one of two species of bacteria--Lactococcus lactis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We then asked whether host environment accounted for the observed patterns of resistance. 4. Resistance to both types of infection varied spatially. The hosts' natural environment was predictive of the observed spatial variation in resistance to L. lactis, but not P. aeruginosa, infection. Specifically, hosts exposed to species-rich bacterial communities were more likely to survive the infection. 5. We conclude that biotic characteristics of the host environment, specifically the number of species of bacteria hosts encounter, shape host resistance to bacterial infection in nature.

Inbreeding effects were evident when releases were undertaken under warm conditions, but not under cold conditions, which illustrates the environment-dependent nature of inbreeding depression. Inbreeding effects were much stronger in the field at warm temperatures than in laboratory stress tests, particularly for females. Effects of inbreeding based on performance in traditional inbreeding assays (viability, productivity) or from laboratory stress tests poorly predicted performance in the field. Inbreeding effects on resource location in the field can be strongly deleterious under some thermal conditions and involve traits not easily measured under laboratory conditions. More generally, inbreeding effects measured in captive populations may not necessarily predict their field performance, and programs to purge captive populations of deleterious alleles may not necessarily lead to fitness benefits in the wild.",2008,"Torsten N Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Ary A Hoffmann, Torsten N Kristensen, Volker Loeschcke, Ary A Hoffmann"
Dap160/intersectin binds and activates aPKC to regulate cell polarity and cell cycle progression,18614576,10.1242/dev.024059,"The atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is required for cell polarization of many cell types, and is upregulated in several human tumors.

We show that Dap160 directly interacts with aPKC, stimulates aPKC activity in vitro and colocalizes with aPKC at the apical cortex of embryonic neuroblasts. In dap160 mutants, aPKC is delocalized from the neuroblast apical cortex and has reduced activity, based on its inability to displace known target proteins from the basal cortex. Both dap160 and aPKC mutants have fewer proliferating neuroblasts and a prolonged neuroblast cell cycle.

Mst2 and Lats kinases regulate apoptotic function of Yes kinase-associated protein (YAP),18640976,10.1074/jbc.M804380200,"The Hippo pathway in Drosophila controls the size and shape of organs. In the fly, activation of this pathway conveys growth-inhibitory signals and promotes apoptosis in epithelial cells. We ""reconstituted"" the Hippo pathway in a human epithelial cell line and showed that, in contrast to flies, the activation of this pathway results in anti-apoptotic signals. We have shown that in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the complex formation between transcriptional co-activators YAPs (Yes kinase-associated proteins) and Lats kinases requires the intact WW domains of YAPs, as well as intact Pro-Pro-AA-Tyr (where AA is any amino acid) motifs in Lats kinases. These kinases cooperate with the upstream Mst2 kinase to phosphorylate YAPs at Ser-127. Overexpression of YAP2 in HEK293 cells promoted apoptosis, whereas the Mst2/Lats1-induced phosphorylation of YAP partially rescued the cells from apoptotic death. Apoptotic signaling of YAP2 was mediated via stabilization of p73, which formed a complex with YAP2. All components of the Hippo pathway that we studied were localized in the cytoplasm, with the exception of YAP, which also localized in the nucleus. The localization of YAP2 in the nucleus was negatively controlled by the Lats1 kinase.

The Drosophila gene zfh2 is required to establish proximal-distal domains in the wing disc,18571155,10.1016/j.ydbio.2008.04.028,"Three main events characterize the development of the proximal-distal axis of the Drosophila wing disc: first, generation of nested circular domains defined by different combinations of gene expression; second, activation of wingless (wg) gene expression in a ring of cells; and third, an increase of cell number in each domain in response to Wg. The mechanisms by which these domains of gene expression are established and maintained are unknown. We have analyzed the role of the gene zinc finger homeodomain 2 (zfh2). We report that in discs lacking zfh2 the limits of the expression domains of the genes tsh, nub, rn, dve and nab coincide, and expression of wg in the wing hinge, is lost. We show that zfh2 expression is delimited distally by Vg, Nub and Dpp signalling, and proximally by Tsh and Dpp. Distal repression of zfh2 permits activation of nab in the wing blade and wg in the wing hinge. We suggest that the proximal-most wing fate, the hinge, is specified first and that later repression of zfh2 permits specification of the distal-most fate, the wing blade. We propose that proximal-distal axis development is achieved by a combination of two strategies: on one hand a process involving proximal to distal specification, with the wing hinge specified first followed later by the distal wing blade; on the other hand, early specification of the proximal-distal domains by different combinations of gene expression.

Multilayer three-dimensional super resolution imaging of thick biological samples,19088193,10.1073/pnas.0810636105,"Recent advances in optical microscopy have enabled biological imaging beyond the diffraction limit at nanometer resolution. A general feature of most of the techniques based on photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has been the use of thin biological samples in combination with total internal reflection, thus limiting the imaging depth to a fraction of an optical wavelength. However, to study whole cells or organelles that are typically up to 15 microm deep into the cell, the extension of these methods to a three-dimensional (3D) super resolution technique is required. Here, we report an advance in optical microscopy that enables imaging of protein distributions in cells with a lateral localization precision better than 50 nm at multiple imaging planes deep in biological samples. The approach is based on combining the lateral super resolution provided by PALM with two-photon temporal focusing that provides optical sectioning. We have generated super-resolution images over an axial range of approximately 10 microm in both mitochondrially labeled fixed cells, and in the membranes of living S2 Drosophila cells.",2008,"Alipasha Vaziri, Jianyong Tang, Hari Shroff, Charles V Shank, Alipasha Vaziri, Jianyong Tang, Hari Shroff, Charles V Shank"
Molecular basis of the mammalian pressure-sensitive ion channels: focus on vascular mechanotransduction,18343483,10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2008.02.006,"Mechano-gated ion channels are implicated in a variety of neurosensory functions ranging from touch sensitivity to hearing. In the heart, rhythm disturbance subsequent to mechanical effects is also associated with the activation of stretch-sensitive ion channels. Arterial autoregulation in response to hemodynamic stimuli, a vital process required for protection against hypertension-induced injury, is similarly dependent on the activity of force-sensitive ion channels. Seminal work in prokaryotes and invertebrates, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly drosophila, greatly helped to identify the molecular basis of volume regulation, hearing and touch sensitivity. In mammals, more recent findings have indicated that members of several structural family of ion channels, namely the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, the amiloride-sensitive ENaC/ASIC channels and the potassium channels K2P and Kir are involved in cellular mechanotransduction. In the present review, we will focus on the molecular and functional properties of these channel subunits and will emphasize on their role in the pressure-dependent arterial myogenic constriction and the flow-mediated vasodilation.",2008,"Joost H A Folgering, Reza Sharif-Naeini, Alexandra Dedman, Amanda Patel, Patrick Delmas, Eric Honoré, Joost H A Folgering, Reza Sharif-Naeini, Alexandra Dedman, Amanda Patel, Patrick Delmas, Eric Honoré"
Host adaptation of a Wolbachia strain after long-term serial passage in mosquito cell lines,18836024,10.1128/AEM.01038-08,"The horizontal transfer of the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis between invertebrate hosts hinges on the ability of Wolbachia to adapt to new intracellular environments. The experimental transfer of Wolbachia between distantly related host species often results in the loss of infection, presumably due to an inability of Wolbachia to adapt quickly to the new host. To examine the process of adaptation to a novel host, we transferred a life-shortening Wolbachia strain, wMelPop, from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster into a cell line derived from the mosquito Aedes albopictus. After long-term serial passage in this cell line, we transferred the mosquito-adapted wMelPop into cell lines derived from two other mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. After a prolonged period of serial passage in mosquito cell lines, wMelPop was reintroduced into its native host, D. melanogaster, by embryonic microinjection. The cell line-adapted wMelPop strains were characterized by a loss of infectivity when reintroduced into the original host, grew to decreased densities, and had reduced abilities to cause life-shortening infection and cytoplasmic incompatibility compared to the original strain. We interpret these shifts in phenotype as evidence for genetic adaptation to the mosquito intracellular environment. The use of cell lines to preadapt Wolbachia to novel hosts is suggested as a possible strategy to improve the success of transinfection in novel target insect species.",2008,"Conor J McMeniman, Amanda M Lane, Amy W C Fong, Denis A Voronin, Iñaki Iturbe-Ormaetxe, Ryuichi Yamada, Elizabeth A McGraw, Scott L O'Neill, Conor J McMeniman, Amanda M Lane, Amy W C Fong, Denis A Voronin, Iñaki Iturbe-Ormaetxe, Ryuichi Yamada, Elizabeth A McGraw, Scott L O'Neill"
Genotoxicity of triasulfuron in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster is modulated by winter wheat seedlings,18468945,10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.03.005,"Triasulfuron (TS) is a widely used sulfonylurea herbicide which inhibits the acetolactate synthase in broad-leaf weeds and in some wheat crop grasses (Triticum aestivum L.). Residues can be found in soil and superficial water with high toxicity to primary producers. In cereals, TS metabolism depends on cytochromes P450 (CYPs), the age of seedlings and the interaction with compounds. The genotoxicity of TS was demonstrated in the wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster, an in vivo assay based on the loss of heterozygosity of the mwh and flr markers in the wing imaginal disk cells of larvae fed with chemical agents. Chronic treatments with analytical grade TS, commercial formulation TS (Amber) 75WG) (0.5mg/mL) and commercial formulation bentazon (Basagran) 480) (0.24mg/mL) were performed with three-day-old larvae of the standard (ST) and the high bioactivation (HB) crosses with regulated and high constitutive levels of CYPs, respectively. To demonstrate the effect of winter wheat metabolism on TS genotoxicity, T. aestivum L. seedlings were immersed for 4h in these herbicides, and aqueous extracts (AEs) of the roots were prepared to expose the larvae. TS and Amber 75WG produced similar genotoxic effects in both crosses. Wheat metabolism modulated the genotoxicity because the AEs yielded statistically significant lower spot frequencies in the HB cross than in the ST cross. Differences between the two crosses of the wing spot test in D. melanogaster must be related to CYPs levels. Basagran 480 was genotoxic only in the HB cross, and wheat metabolism did not modulate its genotoxicity.",2008,"Maria Eugenia Heres-Pulido, Samantha Lombera-Hernández, Irma Dueñas-García, Ivonne Perales-Canales, Laura Castañeda-Partida, Clara Rocha-Ortiz, Saúl Flores-Maya, Angel Durán-Díaz, Ulrich Graf, Maria Eugenia Heres-Pulido, Samantha Lombera-Hernández, Irma Dueñas-García, Ivonne Perales-Canales, Laura Castañeda-Partida, Clara Rocha-Ortiz, Saúl Flores-Maya, Angel Durán-Díaz, Ulrich Graf"

The objective of this study was to optimize culture conditions for growth of recombinant Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells (S2AcRVGP) in order to enhance the production of rRVGP. The addition of DMSO and glycerol to the medium and growth at a reduced temperature (22 degrees C) were the culture condition variations selected to be tested. Experimental cultures were first performed in serum-free Sf900 II medium in 250 ml Schott flasks. The most promising conditions identified in these experiments were also tested on a higher scale in a 3l bioreactor. In the Schott flasks experiments, all the changes in culture conditions resulted in an increase of rRVGP production. The protein concentration was 3.6-fold higher with addition of 1% DMSO and 1% glycerol and 9.3-fold higher when the cells were cultured at 22 degrees C instead of the standard 28 degrees C. The maximum concentration of rRVGP reached was 591 mug l(-1). In bioreactor experiments, with control of pH at 6.20 and DO at 50%, the reduced culture temperature (22 degrees C) was the strategy that promoted the highest glycoprotein production, 928 mug l(-1).",2008,"Kamilla Swiech, Nickeli Rossi, Renato M Astray, Cláudio A T Suazo, Kamilla Swiech, Nickeli Rossi, Renato M Astray, Cláudio A T Suazo"
Akt regulates centrosome migration and spindle orientation in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo,18268102,10.1083/jcb.200705085,"Correct positioning and morphology of the mitotic spindle is achieved through regulating the interaction between microtubules (MTs) and cortical actin. Here we find that, in the Drosophila melanogaster early embryo, reduced levels of the protein kinase Akt result in incomplete centrosome migration around cortical nuclei, bent mitotic spindles, and loss of nuclei into the interior of the embryo. We show that Akt is enriched at the embryonic cortex and is required for phosphorylation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3beta homologue Zeste-white 3 kinase (Zw3) and for the cortical localizations of the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC)-related protein APC2/E-APC and the MT + Tip protein EB1. We also show that reduced levels of Akt result in mislocalization of APC2 in postcellularized embryonic mitoses and misorientation of epithelial mitotic spindles. Together, our results suggest that Akt regulates a complex containing Zw3, Armadillo, APC2, and EB1 and that this complex has a role in stabilizing MT-cortex interactions, facilitating both centrosome separation and mitotic spindle orientation.",2008,"Graham J Buttrick, Luke M A Beaumont, Jessica Leitch, Christopher Yau, Julian R Hughes, James G Wakefield, Graham J Buttrick, Luke M A Beaumont, Jessica Leitch, Christopher Yau, Julian R Hughes, James G Wakefield"

To throw light on the function of IA-2 we examined the role of ia2, a Drosophila homologue, during Drosophila development. In situ hybridization showed that ia2 was expressed in the central nervous system and midgut region. The neuronal expression pattern of ia2 was very similar to that of IA-2 in mammals. Disruption of gut-specific ia2 expression by double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) resulted in defects in gut development, and this phenotype was rescued by overexpression of hexokinase. Until now the roles of IA-2 and hexokinase in insulin signaling have been described separately but we found that ia2 modulated the expression of both insulin and hexokinase. Moreover this modulation seems to be important for gut development during metamorphosis. As the pancreas develops from the gut during vertebrate development, our results suggest a possible role of IA-2 in insulin and hexokinase regulation.",2008,"Jihyun Kim, Hyojoo Bang, Syungkyun Ko, Inhee Jung, Haehee Hong, Jeongsil Kim-Ha, Jihyun Kim, Hyojoo Bang, Syungkyun Ko, Inhee Jung, Haehee Hong, Jeongsil Kim-Ha"
Mechanical factors activate beta-catenin-dependent oncogene expression in APC mouse colon,19404440,10.2976/1.2955566,"beta-catenin acts as a critical regulator of gastrointestinal homeostasis through its control of the Wnt signaling pathway, and genetic or epigenetic lesions which activate Wnt signaling are the primary feature of colon cancer. beta-catenin is also a key element of mechanotranscription pathways, leading to upregulation of master developmental gene expression during Drosophila gastrulation, or regulating mammalian bone development and maintenance. Here we investigate the impact of mechanical stimulation on the initiation of colon cancer. Myc and Twist1, two oncogenes regulated through beta-catenin, are expressed in response to transient compression in APC deficient (APC(1638N+)) colon tissue explants, but not in wild-type colon explants. Mechanical stimulation of APC(1638N+) tissue leads to the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at tyrosine 654, the site of interaction with E-cadherin, as well as to increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin. The mechanical activation of Myc and Twist1 expression in APC(1638N+) colon can be prevented by blocking beta-catenin phosphorylation using Src kinase inhibitors. Microenvironmental signals are known to cooperate with genetic lesions to promote the nuclear beta-catenin accumulation which drives colon cancer. Here we demonstrate that when APC is limiting, mechanical strain, such as that associated with intestinal transit or tumor growth, can be interpreted by cells of preneoplastic colon tissue as a signal to initiate a beta-catenin dependent transcriptional program characteristic of cancer.",2008,"Joanne Whitehead, Danijela Vignjevic, Claus Fütterer, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Sylvie Robine, Emmanuel Farge, Joanne Whitehead, Danijela Vignjevic, Claus Fütterer, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Sylvie Robine, Emmanuel Farge"

Its structural components are synthesized in the somatic follicle cells in a precise temporally and spatially regulated manner. This review will summarize our knowledge of eggshell gene expression. We will discuss the amplification of the chorion gene clusters and the data acquired on the expression patterns and the regulatory elements controlling transcription of eggshell genes.

Reactive oxygen species act remotely to cause synapse loss in a Drosophila model of developmental mitochondrial encephalopathy,18599508,10.1242/dev.020644,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, yet its precise role in disease pathology remains unclear. To examine this link directly, we subtly perturbed electron transport chain function in the Drosophila retina, creating a model of Leigh Syndrome, an early-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Using mutations that affect mitochondrial complex II, we demonstrate that mild disruptions of mitochondrial function have no effect on the initial stages of photoreceptor development, but cause degeneration of their synapses and cell bodies in late pupal and adult animals. In this model, synapse loss is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, not energy depletion, as ATP levels are normal in mutant photoreceptors, and both pharmacological and targeted genetic manipulations that reduce ROS levels prevent synapse degeneration. Intriguingly, these manipulations of ROS uncouple synaptic effects from degenerative changes in the cell body, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction activates two genetically separable processes, one that induces morphological changes in the cell body, and another that causes synapse loss. Finally, by blocking mitochondrial trafficking into the axon using a mutation affecting a mitochondrial transport complex, we find that ROS action restricted to the cell body is sufficient to cause synaptic degeneration, demonstrating that ROS need not act locally at the synapse. Thus, alterations in electron transport chain function explain many of the neurodegenerative changes seen in both early- and late-onset disorders.",2008,"Joshua D Mast, Katharine M H Tomalty, Hannes Vogel, Thomas R Clandinin, Joshua D Mast, Katharine M H Tomalty, Hannes Vogel, Thomas R Clandinin"
Bayesian variable selection for detecting adaptive genomic differences among populations,18245358,10.1534/genetics.107.081281,"We extend an F(st)-based Bayesian hierarchical model, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo, for the detection of loci that might be subject to positive selection.

We introduce a Bayesian auxiliary variable for each locus effect to automatically select nonneutral locus effects. As a by-product, the efficiency of the original approach is improved by using a reparameterization of the model. The statistical power of the extended algorithm is assessed with simulated data sets from a Wright-Fisher model with migration. We find that the inclusion of model selection suggests a clear improvement in discrimination as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, we illustrate and discuss the quality of the newly developed method on the basis of an allozyme data set of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and a sequence data set of the wild tomato Solanum chilense.

We circumvented this problem by employing a candidate complex approach to study sequence variation in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) genes within and among three distinct Drosophila simulans mtDNA haplogroups. First, we determined sequence variation in complete coding regions for all COX mtDNA and nuclear loci and their isoforms. Second, we constructed a quaternary structure model of D. simulans COX. Third, we predicted that six of nine amino acid changes in D. simulans mtDNA are likely to be functionally important. Of these seven, genetic crosses can experimentally determine the functional significance of three. Fourth, we identified two single amino acid changes and a deletion of two consecutive amino acids in nuclear encoded COX loci that are likely to influence cytochrome c oxidase activity. These data show that linking population genetics and quaternary structure modeling can lead to functional predictions of specific mtDNA amino acid mutations and validate the candidate complex approach.",2008,"Richard G Melvin, Subhash D Katewa, J William O Ballard, Richard G Melvin, Subhash D Katewa, J William O Ballard"

A point mutation (P56S) in the MSP domain of human VAPB is associated with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here we show that the MSP domains of VAP proteins are cleaved and secreted ligands for Eph receptors. The P58S mutation in VAP33 leads to a failure to secrete the MSP domain as well as ubiquitination, accumulation of inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum, and an unfolded protein response.

Drosophila Gene Expression Pattern Annotation Using Sparse Features and Term-Term Interactions,21614142,10.1145/1557019.1557068,"The Drosophila gene expression pattern images document the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression and they are valuable tools for explicating the gene functions, interaction, and networks during Drosophila embryogenesis. To provide text-based pattern searching, the images in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) study are annotated with ontology terms manually by human curators. We present a systematic approach for automating this task, because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing. We consider both improved feature representation and novel learning formulation to boost the annotation performance. For feature representation, we adapt the bag-of-words scheme commonly used in visual recognition problems so that the image group information in the BDGP study is retained. Moreover, images from multiple views can be integrated naturally in this representation. To reduce the quantization error caused by the bag-of-words representation, we propose an improved feature representation scheme based on the sparse learning technique. In the design of learning formulation, we propose a local regularization framework that can incorporate the correlations among terms explicitly. We further show that the resulting optimization problem admits an analytical solution. Experimental results show that the representation based on sparse learning outperforms the bag-of-words representation significantly. Results also show that incorporation of the term-term correlations improves the annotation performance consistently.",2009,"Shuiwang Ji, Lei Yuan, Ying-Xin Li, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye, Shuiwang Ji, Lei Yuan, Ying-Xin Li, Zhi-Hua Zhou, Sudhir Kumar, Jieping Ye"
The establishment of sexual identity in the Drosophila germline,19855024,10.1242/dev.042374,"The establishment of sexual identity is a crucial step of germ cell development in sexually reproducing organisms. Sex determination in the germline is controlled differently than in the soma, and often depends on communication from the soma. To investigate how sexual identity is established in the Drosophila germline, we first conducted a molecular screen for genes expressed in a sex-specific manner in embryonic germ cells. Sex-specific expression of these genes is initiated at the time of gonad formation (stage 15), indicating that sexual identity in the germline is established by this time. Experiments where the sex of the soma was altered relative to that of the germline (by manipulating transformer) reveal a dominant role for the soma in regulating initial germline sexual identity. Germ cells largely take on the sex of the surrounding soma, although the sex chromosome constitution of the germ cells still plays some role at this time. The male soma signals to the germline through the JAK/STAT pathway, while the nature of the signal from the female soma remains unknown. We also find that the genes ovo and ovarian tumor (otu) are expressed in a female-specific manner in embryonic germ cells, consistent with their role in promoting female germline identity. However, removing the function of ovo and otu, or reducing germline function of Sex lethal, had little effect on establishment of germline sexual identity. This is consistent with our findings that signals from the soma are dominant over germline autonomous cues at the initial stage of germline sex determination.",2009,"Abbie L Casper, Mark Van Doren, Abbie L Casper, Mark Van Doren"

Core exosome-independent roles for Rrp6 in cell cycle progression,19225159,10.1091/mbc.e08-08-0825,"Exosome complexes are 3' to 5' exoribonucleases composed of subunits that are critical for numerous distinct RNA metabolic (ribonucleometabolic) pathways. Several studies have implicated the exosome subunits Rrp6 and Dis3 in chromosome segregation and cell division but the functional relevance of these findings remains unclear. Here, we report that, in Drosophila melanogaster S2 tissue culture cells, dRrp6 is required for cell proliferation and error-free mitosis, but the core exosome subunit Rrp40 is not. Micorarray analysis of dRrp6-depleted cell reveals increased levels of cell cycle- and mitosis-related transcripts. Depletion of dRrp6 elicits a decrease in the frequency of mitotic cells and in the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (pH3), with a concomitant increase in defects in chromosome congression, separation, and segregation. Endogenous dRrp6 dynamically redistributes during mitosis, accumulating predominantly but not exclusively on the condensed chromosomes. In contrast, core subunits localize predominantly to MTs throughout cell division. Finally, dRrp6-depleted cells treated with microtubule poisons exhibit normal kinetochore recruitment of the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 without restoring pH3 levels, suggesting that these cells undergo premature chromosome condensation. Collectively, these data support the idea that dRrp6 has a core exosome-independent role in cell cycle and mitotic progression.",2009,"Amy C Graham, Daniel L Kiss, Erik D Andrulis, Amy C Graham, Daniel L Kiss, Erik D Andrulis"

Both proteins undergo redox-dependent ligand switching and CO- and NO-induced ligand displacement. In the Fe(III) oxidation state, the nuclear receptor hemes are low spin and 6-coordinate with cysteine(thiolate) as one of the two axial heme ligands. The sixth ligand is a neutral donor, presumably histidine. When the heme is reduced to the Fe(II) oxidation state, the cysteine(thiolate) is replaced by a different neutral donor ligand, whose identity is not known. CO binds to the Fe(II) heme in both E75(LBD) and Rev-erbbeta(LBD) opposite a sixth neutral ligand, plausibly the same histidine that served as the sixth ligand in the Fe(III) state. NO binds to the heme of both proteins; however, the NO-heme is 5-coordinate in E75 and 6-coordinate in Rev-erbbeta.

Impairment of ubiquitylation by mutation in Drosophila E1 promotes both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous Ras-ERK activation in vivo,19366732,10.1242/jcs.042267,"Ras signaling can promote proliferation, cell survival and differentiation. Mutations in components of the Ras pathway are found in many solid tumors and are associated with developmental disorders. We demonstrate here that Drosophila tissues containing hypomorphic mutations in E1, the most upstream enzyme in the ubiquitin pathway, display cell-autonomous upregulation of Ras-ERK activity and Ras-dependent ectopic proliferation. Ubiquitylation is widely accepted to regulate receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) endocytosis upstream of Ras. However, although the ectopic proliferation of E1 hypomorphs is dramatically suppressed by removing one copy of Ras, removal of the more upstream components Egfr, Grb2 or sos shows no suppression. Thus, decreased ubiquitylation may lead to growth-relevant Ras-ERK activation by failing to regulate a step downstream of RTK endocytosis. We further demonstrate that Drosophila Ras is ubiquitylated. Our findings suggest that Ras ubiquitylation restricts growth and proliferation in vivo. We also report our intriguing observation that complete inactivation of E1 causes non-autonomous activation of Ras-ERK in adjacent tissue, mimicking oncogenic Ras overexpression. We demonstrate that maintaining sufficient E1 function is required both cell autonomously and non-cell autonomously to prevent inappropriate Ras-ERK-dependent growth and proliferation in vivo and may implicate loss of Ras ubiquitylation in developmental disorders and cancer.",2009,"Hua Yan, Mei-Ling Chin, Elizabeth A Horvath, Elizabeth A Kane, Cathie M Pfleger, Hua Yan, Mei-Ling Chin, Elizabeth A Horvath, Elizabeth A Kane, Cathie M Pfleger"
Characterization of tafazzin splice variants from humans and fruit flies,19700766,10.1074/jbc.M109.016642,"The tafazzin gene encodes a phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase involved in cardiolipin metabolism, but it is not known why it forms multiple transcripts as a result of alternative splicing. Here we studied the intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, and metabolic function of four isoforms of human tafazzin and three isoforms of Drosophila tafazzin upon expression in different mammalian and insect systems. When expressed in HeLa cells, all isoforms were localized in mitochondria except for the B-form of Drosophila tafazzin, which was associated with multiple intracellular membranes. Among the human isoforms, only full-length tafazzin (FL) and tafazzin lacking exon 5 (Delta5) had transacylase activity, and only these two isoforms were able to restore a normal cardiolipin pattern, normal respiratory activity of mitochondria, and male fertility in tafazzin-deficient flies. Both FL and Delta5 were associated with large protein complexes in 293T cell mitochondria, but treatment with alkali and proteinase K suggested that the Delta5 isoform was more integrated into the hydrophobic core of the membrane than the FL isoform. Although all Drosophila isoforms showed transacylase activity in vitro, only the A-form supported cardiolipin remodeling in flies. The data suggest that humans express two mitochondrial isoenzymes of tafazzin that have similar transacylase activities but different membrane topologies. Furthermore, the data show that the expression of human tafazzin in flies creates cardiolipin with a Drosophila pattern, suggesting that the characteristic fatty acid profile of cardiolipin is not determined by the substrate specificity of tafazzin.",2009,"Yang Xu, Shali Zhang, Ashim Malhotra, Irit Edelman-Novemsky, Jinping Ma, Antonina Kruppa, Carolina Cernicica, Steven Blais, Thomas A Neubert, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame, Yang Xu, Shali Zhang, Ashim Malhotra, Irit Edelman-Novemsky, Jinping Ma, Antonina Kruppa, Carolina Cernicica, Steven Blais, Thomas A Neubert, Mindong Ren, Michael Schlame"
A dual role for the adaptor protein DRK in Drosophila olfactory learning and memory,19244537,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3670-08.2009,"Participation of RAS, RAF, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in learning and memory has been demonstrated in a number of studies, but the molecular events requisite for cascade activation and regulation have not been explored. We demonstrate that the adapter protein DRK (downstream of receptor kinase) which is essential for signaling to RAS in developmental contexts, is preferentially distributed in the adult mushroom bodies, centers for olfactory learning and memory. We demonstrate that drk mutant heterozygotes exhibit deficits in olfactory learning and memory, apparent under limited training conditions, but are not impaired in sensory responses requisite for the association of the stimuli, or brain neuroanatomy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the protein is required acutely within mushroom body neurons to mediate efficient learning, a process that requires RAF activation. Importantly, 90 min memory remained impaired, even after differential training yielding equivalent learning in animals with compromised DRK levels and controls and did not require RAF. Sustained MAPK activation is compromised in drk mutants and surprisingly is negatively regulated by constitutive RAF activity. The data establish a role for DRK in Drosophila behavioral neuroplasticity and suggest a dual role for the protein, first in RAF activation-dependent learning and additionally in RAF-inhibition dependent sustained MAPK activation essential for memory formation or stability.",2009,"Anastasios Moressis, Anke R Friedrich, Elias Pavlopoulos, Ronald L Davis, Efthimios M C Skoulakis, Anastasios Moressis, Anke R Friedrich, Elias Pavlopoulos, Ronald L Davis, Efthimios M C Skoulakis"
SAP18 promotes Krüppel-dependent transcriptional repression by enhancer-specific histone deacetylation,19049982,10.1074/jbc.M806163200,"Body pattern formation during early embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster relies on a zygotic cascade of spatially restricted transcription factor activities. The gap gene Krüppel ranks at the top level of this cascade. It encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein that interacts directly with cis-acting stripe enhancer elements of pair rule genes, such as even skipped and hairy, at the next level of the gene hierarchy. Krüppel mediates their transcriptional repression by direct association with the corepressor Drosophila C terminus-binding protein (dCtBP). However, for some Krüppel target genes, deletion of the dCtBP-binding sites does not abolish repression, implying a dCtBP-independent mode of repression. We identified Krüppel-binding proteins by mass spectrometry and found that SAP18 can both associate with Krüppel and support Krüppel-dependent repression. Genetic interaction studies combined with pharmacological and biochemical approaches suggest a site-specific mechanism of Krüppel-dependent gene silencing. The results suggest that Krüppel tethers the SAP18 bound histone deacetylase complex 1 at distinct enhancer elements, which causes repression via histone H3 deacetylation.",2009,"Alexey Matyash, Navjot Singh, Steven D Hanes, Henning Urlaub, Herbert Jäckle, Alexey Matyash, Navjot Singh, Steven D Hanes, Henning Urlaub, Herbert Jäckle"
Multiple invasions of Gypsy and Micropia retroelements in genus Zaprionus and melanogaster subgroup of the genus Drosophila,19954522,10.1186/1471-2148-9-279,"Background:
        
      
      The Zaprionus genus shares evolutionary features with the melanogaster subgroup, such as space and time of origin. Although little information about the transposable element content in the Zaprionus genus had been accumulated, some of their elements appear to be more closely related with those of the melanogaster subgroup, indicating that these two groups of species were involved in horizontal transfer events during their evolution. Among these elements, the Gypsy and the Micropia retroelements were chosen for screening in seven species of the two Zaprionus subgenera, Anaprionus and Zaprionus.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Screening allowed the identification of diverse Gypsy and Micropia retroelements only in species of the Zaprionus subgenus, showing that they are transcriptionally active in the sampled species. The sequences of each retroelement were closely related to those of the melanogaster species subgroup, and the most parsimonious hypothesis would be that 15 horizontal transfer events shaped their evolution. The Gypsy retroelement of the melanogaster subgroup probably invaded the Zaprionus genomes about 11 MYA. In contrast, the Micropia retroelement may have been introduced into the Zaprionus subgenus and the melanogaster subgroup from an unknown donor more recently (~3 MYA).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Gypsy and Micropia of Zaprionus and melanogaster species share similar evolutionary patterns. The sharing of evolutionary, ecological and ethological features probably allowed these species to pass through a permissive period of transposable element invasion, explaining the proposed waves of horizontal transfers.",2009,"Nathalia de Setta, Marie-Anne Van Sluys, Pierre Capy, Claudia M A Carareto, Nathalia de Setta, Marie-Anne Van Sluys, Pierre Capy, Claudia M A Carareto"
Transpositionally active episomal hAT elements,20003420,10.1186/1471-2199-10-108,"Background:
        
      
      hAT elements and V(D)J recombination may have evolved from a common ancestral transposable element system. Extrachromosomal, circular forms of transposable elements (referred to here as episomal forms) have been reported yet their biological significance remains unknown. V(D)J signal joints, which resemble episomal transposable elements, have been considered non-recombinogenic products of V(D)J recombination and a safe way to dispose of excised chromosomal sequences. V(D)J signal joints can, however, participate in recombination reactions and the purpose of this study was to determine if hobo and Hermes episomal elements are also recombinogenic.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Up to 50% of hobo/Hermes episomes contained two intact, inverted-terminal repeats and 86% of these contained from 1-1000 bp of intercalary DNA. Episomal hobo/Hermes elements were recovered from Musca domestica (a natural host of Hermes), Drosophila melanogaster (a natural host of hobo) and transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti (with autonomous Hermes elements). Episomal Hermes elements were recovered from unfertilized eggs of M. domestica and D. melanogaster demonstrating their potential for extrachromosomal, maternal transmission. Reintegration of episomal Hermes elements was observed in vitro and in vivo and the presence of Hermes episomes resulted in lower rates of canonical Hermes transposition in vivo.

JNK/FOXO-mediated neuronal expression of fly homologue of peroxiredoxin II reduces oxidative stress and extends life span,19720829,10.1074/jbc.M109.028027,"Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in neurons increases stress resistance and extends life span, in part through FOXO-mediated transcription in Drosophila. However, the JNK/FOXO target genes are unknown. Here, we identified Jafrac1, a Drosophila homolog of human Peroxiredoxin II (hPrxII), as a downstream effecter of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons that enhances stress resistance and extends life span. We found that Jafrac1 was expressed in the adult brain and induced by paraquat, a reactive oxygen species-generating chemical. RNA interference-mediated neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 enhanced, while neuronal overexpression of Jafrac1 and hPrxII suppressed, paraquat-induced lethality in flies. Neuronal expression of Jafrac1 also significantly reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial function, and attenuated JNK activation caused by paraquat. Activation of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons increased the Jafrac1 expression level under both normal and oxidative stressed conditions. Moreover, neuronal knockdown of Jafrac1 shortened, while overexpression of Jafrac1 and hPrxII extended, the life span in flies. These results support the hypothesis that JNK/FOXO signaling extends life span via amelioration of oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons.",2009,"Kyu-Sun Lee, Kanae Iijima-Ando, Koichi Iijima, Won-Jae Lee, Joon H Lee, Kweon Yu, Dong-Seok Lee, Kyu-Sun Lee, Kanae Iijima-Ando, Koichi Iijima, Won-Jae Lee, Joon H Lee, Kweon Yu, Dong-Seok Lee"

Chromosomal regions that experience reduced recombination in hybrids, such as within inversions, have been hypothesized to contribute to the maintenance of species integrity. Here, we examine genomic sequences from closely related fruit fly taxa of the Drosophila pseudoobscura subgroup to reconstruct their evolutionary histories and past patterns of genic exchange. Partial genomic assemblies were generated from two subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura (D. ps.) and an outgroup species, D. miranda. These new assemblies were compared to available assemblies of D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, two species with overlapping ranges in western North America. Within inverted regions, nucleotide divergence among each pair of the three species is comparable, whereas divergence between D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis in non-inverted regions is much lower and closer to levels of intraspecific variation. Using molecular markers flanking each of the major chromosomal inversions, we identify strong crossover suppression in F(1) hybrids extending over 2 megabase pairs (Mbp) beyond the inversion breakpoints. These regions of crossover suppression also exhibit the high nucleotide divergence associated with inverted regions. Finally, by comparison to a geographically isolated subspecies, D. ps. bogotana, our results suggest that autosomal gene exchange between the North American species, D. ps. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis, occurred since the split of the subspecies, likely within the last 200,000 years. We conclude that chromosomal rearrangements have been vital to the ongoing persistence of these species despite recent hybridization.

Motopsin KO mice did not have significant deficits in memory formation, as tested using the Morris water maze, passive avoidance and Y-maze tests. A social recognition test showed that the motopsin KO mice had the ability to recognize two stimulator mice, suggesting normal social memory. In a social novelty test, motopsin KO mice spent a longer time investigating a familiar mouse than wild-type (WT) mice did. In a resident-intruder test, motopsin KO mice showed prolonged social interaction as compared with WT mice. Consistent with the behavioral deficit, spine density was significantly decreased on apical dendrites, but not on basal dendrites, of hippocampal pyramidal neurons of motopsin KO mice. In contrast, pyramidal neurons at the cingulate cortex showed normal spine density. Spatial learning and social interaction induced the phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) in hippocampal neurons of WT mice, whereas the phosphorylation of CREB was markedly decreased in mutant mouse brains.

      Protein translocation across the membrane of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is the first step in the biogenesis of secretory and membrane proteins. Proteins enter the ER by the Sec61 translocon, a proteinaceous channel composed of three subunits, alpha, beta and gamma. While it is known that Sec61alpha forms the actual channel, the function of the other two subunits remains to be characterized.

      In the present study we have investigated the function of Sec61beta in Drosophila melanogaster. We describe its role in the plasma membrane traffic of Gurken, the ligand for the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor in the oocyte. Germline clones of the mutant allele of Sec61beta show normal translocation of Gurken into the ER and transport to the Golgi complex, but further traffic to the plasma membrane is impeded. The defect in plasma membrane traffic due to absence of Sec61beta is specific for Gurken and is not due to a general trafficking defect.

The yeast Dot1 gene encoding a histone methyltransferase affects localization of silencing proteins including Sir2, and plays an essential role in the repair of damaged DNA. However, it is not known whether an alteration of a histone methyltransferase activity influences lifespan or stress resistance, which is often associated with extended lifespan. Here we investigated whether the Drosophilagrappa (gpp) gene, a Dot1 homolog influences lifespan and stress resistance using transgenic flies overexpressing gpp and those bearing a partial loss-of-function mutation. Overexpression of gpp throughout the adult stage did not extend the lifespan, but significantly enhanced resistances when they were kept on medium containing 1% H(2)O(2), or those with poor nutrients. As well, gpp-overexpressing flies were behaviourally more active than control flies. We investigated whether gpp overexpression induced anti-oxidant genes, Catalase, Sod, Sod2, GstD2, dhd, TrxT and Trx-2. However, none of these genes was induced. A partial loss-of-function mutations in gpp dramatically reduced the lifespan under oxidative and caloric stresses. Taken together, these results demonstrated that gpp is required for normal lifespan and stress resistance, and that its overexpression increases stress resistance in Drosophila, without obvious induction of representative anti-oxidant genes.",2009,"Olivier List, Toru Togawa, Manabu Tsuda, Takashi Matsuo, Loic Elard, Toshiro Aigaki, Olivier List, Toru Togawa, Manabu Tsuda, Takashi Matsuo, Loic Elard, Toshiro Aigaki"

Histone H1 subtypes differentially modulate chromatin condensation without preventing ATP-dependent remodeling by SWI/SNF or NURF,19794910,10.1371/journal.pone.0007243,"Although ubiquitously present in chromatin, the function of the linker histone subtypes is partly unknown and contradictory studies on their properties have been published. To explore whether the various H1 subtypes have a differential role in the organization and dynamics of chromatin we have incorporated all of the somatic human H1 subtypes into minichromosomes and compared their influence on nucleosome spacing, chromatin compaction and ATP-dependent remodeling. H1 subtypes exhibit different affinities for chromatin and different abilities to promote chromatin condensation, as studied with the Atomic Force Microscope. According to this criterion, H1 subtypes can be classified as weak condensers (H1.1 and H1.2), intermediate condensers (H1.3) and strong condensers (H1.0, H1.4, H1.5 and H1x). The variable C-terminal domain is required for nucleosome spacing by H1.4 and is likely responsible for the chromatin condensation properties of the various subtypes, as shown using chimeras between H1.4 and H1.2. In contrast to previous reports with isolated nucleosomes or linear nucleosomal arrays, linker histones at a ratio of one per nucleosome do not preclude remodeling of minichromosomes by yeast SWI/SNF or Drosophila NURF.

The Drosophila deoxyhypusine hydroxylase homologue nero and its target eIF5A are required for cell growth and the regulation of autophagy,19546244,10.1083/jcb.200904161,"Hypusination is a unique posttranslational modification by which lysine is transformed into the atypical amino acid hypusine. eIF5A (eukaryotic initiation factor 5A) is the only known protein to contain hypusine.

Knockdown of the hypusination target eIF5A via RNA interference causes phenotypes similar to nero mutations. However, loss of nero appears to cause milder phenotypes than loss of eIF5A. This is partially explained through a potential compensatory mechanism by which nero mutant cells up-regulate eIF5A levels. The failure of eIF5A up-regulation to rescue nero mutant phenotypes suggests that hypusination is required for eIF5A function. Furthermore, expression of enzymatically impaired forms of DOHH fails to rescue nero clones, indicating that hypusination activity is important for nero function.

We first compared SC development in two species with relatively small combs, Drosophila takahashii, where the SCs remain approximately transverse, and Drosophila biarmipes, where two rows of SC teeth rotate and move in an anterior direction relative to other bristle landmarks. We then analyzed comb ontogeny in species with prominent extended SCs parallel to the proximodistal axis, including Drosophila ficusphila and species of the montium subgroup. Our study allowed us to identify two general methods of generating longitudinal combs on the tarsus, and we showed that a montium subgroup species (Drosophila nikananu) with a comb convergently similar in size, orientation and position to the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, forms its SC through a different developmental mechanism. We also found that the protein product of the leg patterning gene, dachshund (dac), is strongly reduced in the SC in all species, but not in other bristles.

Intrinsic tumor suppression and epithelial maintenance by endocytic activation of Eiger/TNF signaling in Drosophila,19289090,10.1016/j.devcel.2009.01.002,"Oncogenic alterations in epithelial tissues often trigger apoptosis, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism by which organisms eliminate aberrant cells from epithelia. In Drosophila imaginal epithelia, clones of cells mutant for tumor suppressors, such as scrib or dlg, lose their polarity and are eliminated by cell death. Here, we show that Eiger, the Drosophila tumor necrosis factor (TNF), behaves like a tumor suppressor that eliminates oncogenic cells from epithelia through a local endocytic JNK-activation mechanism. In the absence of Eiger, these polarity-deficient clones are no longer eliminated; instead, they grow aggressively into tumors. We show that in scrib clones endocytosis is elevated, which translocates Eiger to endocytic vesicles and leads to activation of apoptotic JNK signaling. Furthermore, blocking endocytosis prevents both JNK activation and cell elimination.

A critical step for postsynaptic F-actin organization: regulation of Baz/Par-3 localization by aPKC and PTEN,19472188,10.1002/dneu.20728,"Actin remodeling has emerged as a critical process during synapse development and plasticity. Thus, understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling actin organization at synapses is exceedingly important. Here, we used the highly plastic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to understand mechanisms of actin remodeling at postsynaptic sites. Previous studies have suggested that the actin-binding proteins Spectrin and Coracle play a critical role in NMJ development and the anchoring of glutamate receptors most likely through actin regulation. Here, we show that an additional determinant of actin organization at the postsynaptic region is the PDZ protein Baz/Par-3. Decreasing Baz levels in postsynaptic muscles has dramatic consequences for the size of F-actin and spectrin domains at the postsynaptic region. In turn, proper localization of Baz at this site depends on both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Baz phosphorylation by its binding partner, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), is required for normal Baz targeting to the postsynaptic region. However, the retention of Baz at this site depends on its dephosphorylation mediated by the lipid and protein phosphatase PTEN. Misregulation of the phosphorylation state of Baz by genetic alterations in PTEN or aPKC activity has detrimental consequences for postsynaptic F-actin and spectrin localization, synaptic growth, and receptor localization. Our results provide a novel mechanism of postsynaptic actin regulation through Baz, governed by the antagonistic actions of aPKC and PTEN. Given the conservation of these proteins from worms to mammals, these results are likely to provide new insight into actin organization pathways. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The island endemic specialist Drosophila sechellia has received considerable attention in evolutionary genetic studies. On the basis of the analysis of a limited number of strains, a handful of studies have reported a strikingly depleted level of genetic variation but little is known about its demographic history. We extended analyses of nucleotide polymorphism in D. sechellia to a species-wide level using 10 nuclear genes sequenced in 10 populations. We confirmed that D. sechellia exhibits little nucleotide-sequence variation. It is characterized by a low effective population size, >10-fold lower than that of D. simulans, which ranks D. sechellia as the least genetically diverse Drosophila species. No obvious population subdivision was detected despite its fragmented geographic distribution on different islands. We used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to test for demographic scenarios compatible with the geological history of the Seychelles and the ecology of D. sechellia. We found that while bottlenecks cannot account for the pattern of molecular evolution observed in this species, scenarios close to the null hypothesis of a constant population size are well supported. We discuss these findings with regard to adaptive features specific to D. sechellia and its life-history strategy.",2009,"Delphine Legrand, Maud I Tenaillon, Pat Matyot, Justin Gerlach, Daniel Lachaise, Marie-Louise Cariou, Delphine Legrand, Maud I Tenaillon, Pat Matyot, Justin Gerlach, Daniel Lachaise, Marie-Louise Cariou"
Hox genes and brain development in Drosophila,20795329,10.1007/978-1-4419-6673-5_11,"Hox genes are prominently expressed in the developing brain and ventral ganglia of Drosophila. In the embryonic brain, the Hox genes labial and Deformed are essential for the establishment of regionalized neuronal identity; in their absence cells are generated in the brain but fail to acquire appropriate neuronal features. Genetic analyses reveal that Hox proteins are largely equivalent in their action in embryonic brain development and that their expression is under the control of cross-regulatory interactions among Hox genes that are similar to those found in embryogenesis of trunk segments. Hox genes have a different role in postembryonic brain development. During the larval phase of CNS development, reactivation of specific Hox genes terminates neural proliferation by induction of apoptotic cell death in neural stem cell-like progenitors called neuroblasts. This reactivation process is tightly controlled by epigenetic mechanisms requiring the Polycomb group of genes. Many features of Hox gene action in Drosophila brain development are evolutionarily conserved and are manifest in brain development of vertebrates.",2010,"Heinrich Reichert, Bruno Bello, Heinrich Reichert, Bruno Bello"

Introgression of Drosophila simulans nuclear pore protein 160 in Drosophila melanogaster alone does not cause inviability but does cause female sterility,20647504,10.1534/genetics.110.119867,"We have been analyzing genes for reproductive isolation by replacing Drosophila melanogaster genes with homologs from Drosophila simulans by interspecific backcrossing. Among the introgressions established, we found that a segment of the left arm of chromosome 2, Int(2L)S, carried recessive genes for hybrid sterility and inviability. That nuclear pore protein 160 (Nup160) in the introgression region is involved in hybrid inviability, as suggested by others, was confirmed by the present analysis. Male hybrids carrying an X chromosome of D. melanogaster were not rescued by the Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) mutation when the D. simulans Nup160 allele was made homozygous or hemizygous. Furthermore, we uniquely found that Nup160 is also responsible for hybrid sterility. Females were sterile when D. simulans Nup160 was made homozygous or hemizygous in the D. melanogaster genetic background. Genetic analyses indicated that the D. simulans Nup160 introgression into D. melanogaster was sufficient to cause female sterility but that other autosomal genes of D. simulans were also necessary to cause lethality.

"DNA methylation and genome evolution in honeybee: gene length, expression, functional enrichment covary with the evolutionary signature of DNA methylation",20924039,10.1093/gbe/evq060,"A growing body of evidence suggests that DNA methylation is functionally divergent among different taxa. The recently discovered functional methylation system in the honeybee Apis mellifera presents an attractive invertebrate model system to study evolution and function of DNA methylation. In the honeybee, DNA methylation is mostly targeted toward transcription units (gene bodies) of a subset of genes. Here, we report an intriguing covariation of length and epigenetic status of honeybee genes. Hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes in honeybee are dramatically different in their lengths for both exons and introns. By analyzing orthologs in Drosophila melanogaster, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and Ciona intestinalis, we show genes that were short and long in the past are now preferentially situated in hyper- and hypomethylated classes respectively, in the honeybee. Moreover, we demonstrate that a subset of high-CpG genes are conspicuously longer than expected under the evolutionary relationship alone and that they are enriched in specific functional categories. We suggest that gene length evolution in the honeybee is partially driven by evolutionary forces related to regulation of gene expression, which in turn is associated with DNA methylation. However, lineage-specific patterns of gene length evolution suggest that there may exist additional forces underlying the observed interaction between DNA methylation and gene lengths in the honeybee.",2010,"Jia Zeng, Soojin V Yi, Jia Zeng, Soojin V Yi"
Transmembrane segment 3 of Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor subunit 85b contributes to ligand-receptor interactions,20147286,10.1074/jbc.M109.058321,"The OR class insect odorant receptors are ligand-gated ion channels comprised of at least one common subunit (OR83b in Drosophila) and at least one putative odorant-binding subunit. However, little else is known about the molecular details of insect OR architecture. For example, nothing is known about how these receptors bind odorants, greatly limiting efforts to develop insect OR-targeted compounds for the control of insects involved in disease propagation and agricultural damage. Here we identify a portion of a Drosophila OR that is involved in odorant activation of the receptor. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we identified residues 146-150 of OR85b, located at the predicted interface between transmembrane segment 3 (TMS3) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), as playing a role in odorant (2-heptanone) activation. We found that occupation of the receptor by the competitive antagonist 2-nonanone protected the receptor from methanethiosulfonate action at position 148, placing this region close to the odorant-binding site. In addition, mutations at positions 142 and 143 within TMS3 altered odorant sensitivity. Our results identify the involvement of the extracellular half of TMS3 in Drosophila OR85b in odorant activation of the receptor. This finding can serve as a starting point for future detailed analysis of the molecular basis for odorant recognition by insect ORs, a novel class of ligand-gated channel.",2010,"Andrew S Nichols, Charles W Luetje, Andrew S Nichols, Charles W Luetje"

Subunits of the Drosophila CCR4-NOT complex and their roles in mRNA deadenylation,20504953,10.1261/rna.2145110,"The CCR4-NOT complex is the main enzyme catalyzing the deadenylation of mRNA. We have investigated the composition of this complex in Drosophila melanogaster by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed against NOT1. The CCR4, CAF1 (=POP2), NOT1, NOT2, NOT3, and CAF40 subunits were associated in a stable complex, but NOT4 was not. Factors known to be involved in mRNA regulation were prominent among the other proteins coprecipitated with the CCR4-NOT complex, as analyzed by mass spectrometry. The complex was localized mostly in the cytoplasm but did not appear to be a major component of P bodies. Of the known CCR4 paralogs, Nocturnin was found associated with the subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex, whereas Angel and 3635 were not. RNAi experiments in Schneider cells showed that CAF1, NOT1, NOT2, and NOT3 are required for bulk poly(A) shortening and hsp70 mRNA deadenylation, but knock-down of CCR4, CAF40, and NOT4 did not affect these processes. Overexpression of catalytically dead CAF1 had a dominant-negative effect on mRNA decay. In contrast, overexpression of inactive CCR4 had no effect. We conclude that CAF1 is the major catalytically important subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex in Drosophila Schneider cells.

Non-molting glossy/shroud encodes a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase that functions in the 'Black Box' of the ecdysteroid biosynthesis pathway,20501590,10.1242/dev.045641,"In insects, the precise timing of molting and metamorphosis is strictly guided by a principal steroid hormone, ecdysone. Among the multiple conversion steps for synthesizing ecdysone from dietary cholesterol, the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to 5beta-ketodiol, the so-called 'Black Box', is thought to be the important rate-limiting step. Although a number of genes essential for ecdysone synthesis have recently been revealed, much less is known about the genes that are crucial for functioning in the Black Box. Here we report on a novel ecdysteroidgenic gene, non-molting glossy (nm-g)/shroud (sro), which encodes a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase. This gene was first isolated by positional cloning of the nm-g mutant of the silkworm Bombyx mori, which exhibits a low ecdysteroid titer and consequently causes a larval arrest phenotype. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, the closest gene to nm-g is encoded by the sro locus, one of the Halloween mutant members that are characterized by embryonic ecdysone deficiency. The lethality of the sro mutant is rescued by the overexpression of either sro or nm-g genes, indicating that these two genes are orthologous. Both the nm-g and the sro genes are predominantly expressed in tissues producing ecdysone, such as the prothoracic glands and the ovaries. Furthermore, the phenotypes caused by the loss of function of these genes are restored by the application of ecdysteroids and their precursor 5beta-ketodiol, but not by cholesterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol.

Translocation of Y-linked genes to the dot chromosome in Drosophila pseudoobscura,20147437,10.1093/molbev/msq045,"One of the most striking cases of sex chromosome reorganization in Drosophila occurred in the lineage ancestral to Drosophila pseudoobscura, where there was a translocation of Y-linked genes to an autosome. These genes went from being present only in males, never recombining, and having an effective population size of 0.5N to a state of autosomal linkage, where they are passed through both sexes, may recombine, and their effective population size has quadrupled. These genes appear to be functional, and they underwent a drastic reduction in intron size after the translocation. A Y-autosome translocation may pose problems in meiosis if the rDNA locus responsible for X-Y pairing had also moved to an autosome. In this study, we demonstrate that the Y-autosome translocation moved Y-linked genes onto the dot chromosome, a small, mainly heterochromatic autosome with some sex chromosome-like properties. The rDNA repeats occur exclusively on the X chromosome in D. pseudoobscura, but we found that the new Y chromosome of this species harbors four clusters bearing only the intergenic spacer region (IGS) of the rDNA repeats. This arrangement appears analogous to the situation in Drosophila simulans, where X-rDNA to Y-IGS pairing could be responsible for X-Y chromosome pairing. We postulate that the nascent D. pseudoobscura Y chromosome acquired and amplified copies of the IGS, suggesting a potential mechanism for X-Y pairing in D. pseudoobscura.",2010,"Amanda M Larracuente, Mohamed A F Noor, Andrew G Clark, Amanda M Larracuente, Mohamed A F Noor, Andrew G Clark"
Sec61alpha is required for dorsal closure during Drosophila embryogenesis through its regulation of Dpp signaling,20112345,10.1002/dvdy.22219,"During dorsal closure in Drosophila, signaling events in the dorsalmost row of epidermal cells (DME cells) direct the migration of lateral epidermal sheets towards the dorsal midline where they fuse to enclose the embryo. A Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade in the DME cells induces the expression of Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Dpp signaling then regulates the cytoskeleton in the DME cells and amnioserosa to affect the cell shape changes necessary to complete dorsal closure. We identified a mutation in Sec61alpha that specifically perturbs dorsal closure. Sec61alpha encodes the main subunit of the translocon complex for co-translational import of proteins into the ER. JNK signaling is normal in Sec61alpha mutant embryos, but Dpp signaling is attenuated and the DME cells fail to maintain an actinomyosin cable as epithelial migration fails. Consistent with this model, dorsal closure is rescued in Sec61alpha mutant embryos by an activated form of the Dpp receptor Thick veins.",2010,"Xiaochen Wang, Robert E Ward 4th, Xiaochen Wang, Robert E Ward 4th"

Coordinated sequential action of EGFR and Notch signaling pathways regulates proneural wave progression in the Drosophila optic lobe,20724446,10.1242/dev.048058,"During neurogenesis in the medulla of the Drosophila optic lobe, neuroepithelial cells are programmed to differentiate into neuroblasts at the medial edge of the developing optic lobe. The wave of differentiation progresses synchronously in a row of cells from medial to the lateral regions of the optic lobe, sweeping across the entire neuroepithelial sheet; it is preceded by the transient expression of the proneural gene lethal of scute [l(1)sc] and is thus called the proneural wave. We found that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway promotes proneural wave progression. EGFR signaling is activated in neuroepithelial cells and induces l(1)sc expression. EGFR activation is regulated by transient expression of Rhomboid (Rho), which is required for the maturation of the EGF ligand Spitz. Rho expression is also regulated by the EGFR signal. The transient and spatially restricted expression of Rho generates sequential activation of EGFR signaling and assures the directional progression of the differentiation wave. This study also provides new insights into the role of Notch signaling. Expression of the Notch ligand Delta is induced by EGFR, and Notch signaling prolongs the proneural state. Notch signaling activity is downregulated by its own feedback mechanism that permits cells at proneural states to subsequently develop into neuroblasts. Thus, coordinated sequential action of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways causes the proneural wave to progress and induce neuroblast formation in a precisely ordered manner.",2010,"Tetsuo Yasugi, Atsushi Sugie, Daiki Umetsu, Tetsuya Tabata, Tetsuo Yasugi, Atsushi Sugie, Daiki Umetsu, Tetsuya Tabata"
Identification of an aggression-promoting pheromone and its receptor neurons in Drosophila,19966787,10.1038/nature08678,"Aggression is regulated by pheromones in many animal species. However, in no system have aggression pheromones, their cognate receptors and corresponding sensory neurons been identified. Here we show that 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), a male-specific volatile pheromone, robustly promotes male-male aggression in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. The aggression-promoting effect of synthetic cVA requires olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing the receptor Or67d, as well as the receptor itself. Activation of Or67d-expressing OSNs, either by genetic manipulation of their excitability or by exposure to male pheromones in the absence of other classes of OSNs, is sufficient to promote aggression. High densities of male flies can promote aggression by the release of volatile cVA. In turn, cVA-promoted aggression can promote male fly dispersal from a food resource, in a manner dependent on Or67d-expressing OSNs. These data indicate that cVA may mediate negative-feedback control of male population density, through its effect on aggression. Identification of a pheromone-OSN pair controlling aggression in a genetic organism opens the way to unravelling the neurobiology of this evolutionarily conserved behaviour.",2010,"Liming Wang, David J Anderson, Liming Wang, David J Anderson"
Function and specificity of synthetic Hox transcription factors in vivo,20147626,10.1073/pnas.0914595107,"Homeotic (Hox) genes encode transcription factors that confer segmental identity along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo. However the molecular mechanisms underlying Hox-mediated transcription and the differential requirements for specificity in the regulation of the vast number of Hox-target genes remain ill-defined. Here we show that synthetic Sex combs reduced (Scr) genes that encode the Scr C terminus containing the homedomain (HD) and YPWM motif (Scr-HD) are functional in vivo. Synthetic Scr-HD peptides can induce ectopic salivary glands in the embryo and homeotic transformations in the adult fly, act as transcriptional activators and repressors during development, and participate in protein-protein interactions. Their transformation capacity was found to be enhanced over their full-length counterpart and mutations known to transform the full-length protein into constitutively active or inactive variants behaved accordingly in the synthetic peptides. Our results show that synthetic Scr-HD genes are sufficient for homeotic function in Drosophila and suggest that the N terminus of Scr has a role in transcriptional potency, rather than specificity.

Seven of the novel members of the gene family turned out to be Drosophila-specific. The expression and evolution of these genes was investigated in the present study. CG11597 is a recently evolved gene that is expressed during all stages of morphogenesis in D. melanogaster. In contrast, the transcription of PpD5, PpD6, Pp1-Y1, and Pp1-Y2 genes is restricted to the pupa and imago developmental stages and to the testis of the males, just as that of the previously characterized PpY-55A and PpN58A. With the exception of the Y-localized Pp1-Y1 and Pp1-Y2, the testis-specific phosphatase genes are expressed in X/0 males, while none of them are expressed in XX/Y females. The mRNA of PpD5, Pp1-Y1, and PpY-55A were detected in the developing cysts by in situ hybridization, in contrast with the PpD6 transcript that was found in the distal ends of elongating spermatids. The latter localization suggests post-meiotic expression. The comparison of PPP genes in five Drosophila species revealed that the sequence of the six testis-specific phosphatases changed more rapidly than that of the housekeeping phosphatases. Our results support the ""faster male"" hypothesis. On the other hand, the male-biased expression of the six genes remained conserved during evolution despite the fact that Pp1-Y1, Pp1-Y2, and PpD6 moved from autosomes to the Y chromosome.

Functions of microRNAs in Drosophila development,20659018,10.1042/BST0381137,"Control of mRNA translation and degradation has been shown to be key in the development of complex organisms.

Control of mRNA stability in eukaryotes is also intimately linked to the regulation of translation. A key question in the control of mRNA turnover concerns the mechanisms whereby particular mRNAs are specifically degraded in response to cellular factors. Recently, microRNAs have been shown to bind specifically to mRNAs and regulate their expression via repression of translation and/or degradation. To understand the molecular mechanisms during microRNA repression of mRNAs, it is necessary to identify their biologically relevant targets. However, computational methods have so far proved unreliable, therefore verification of biologically important targets at present requires experimental analysis.

Mechanosensilla in the adult abdomen of Drosophila: engrailed and slit help to corral the peripheral sensory axons into segmental bundles,20667917,10.1242/dev.044552,"The abdomen of adult Drosophila bears mechanosensory bristles with axons that connect directly to the CNS, each hemisegment contributing a separate nerve bundle.

We find that high levels of Engrailed make the epidermal cells inhospitable to bristle neurons; sensory axons that are too near these cells are either deflected or fail to extend properly or at all. We then searched for the engrailed-dependent agent responsible for these repellent properties. We found slit to be expressed in the P compartment and, using genetic mosaics, present evidence that Slit is the responsible molecule. Blocking the activity of the three Robo genes (putative receptors for Slit) with RNAi supported this hypothesis.

The purpose of the present study was to perform extensive sequence analysis to show that the beta-CAs are present in invertebrates and to clone and characterize a member of this enzyme family from a representative model organism of the animal kingdom, e.g., Drosophila melanogaster.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The novel beta-CA gene, here named DmBCA, was identified from FlyBase, and its orthologs were searched and reconstructed from sequence databases, confirming the presence of beta-CA sequences in 55 metazoan species. The corresponding recombinant enzyme was produced in Sf9 insect cells, purified, kinetically characterized, and its inhibition was investigated with a series of simple, inorganic anions. Holoenzyme molecular mass was defined by dynamic light scattering analysis and gel filtration, and the results suggested that the holoenzyme is a dimer. Double immunostaining confirmed predictions based on sequence analysis and localized DmBCA protein to mitochondria. The enzyme showed high CO2 hydratase activity, with a kcat of 9.5 x 105 s-1 and a kcat/KM of 1.1 x 108 M-1s-1. DmBCA was appreciably inhibited by the clinically-used sulfonamide acetazolamide, with an inhibition constant of 49 nM. It was moderately inhibited by halides, pseudohalides, hydrogen sulfide, bisulfite and sulfate (KI values of 0.67 - 1.36 mM) and more potently by sulfamide (KI of 0.15 mM). Bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite and phenylarsonic/boronic acids were much weaker inhibitors (KIs of 26.9 - 43.7 mM).

Alternative exon usage in the single CPT1 gene of Drosophila generates functional diversity in the kinetic properties of the enzyme: differential expression of alternatively spliced variants in Drosophila tissues,20061394,10.1074/jbc.M109.072892,"The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains only one CPT1 gene (Jackson, V. N., Cameron, J. M., Zammit, V. A., and Price, N. T. (1999) Biochem. J. 341, 483-489). We have now extended our original observation to all insect genomes that have been sequenced, suggesting that a single CPT1 gene is a universal feature of insect genomes. We hypothesized that insects may be able to generate kinetically distinct variants by alternative splicing of their single CPT1 gene. Analysis of the insect genomes revealed that (a) the single CPT1 gene in each and every insect genome contains two alternative exons and (ii) in all cases, the putative alternative splicing site occurs within a small region corresponding to 21 amino acid residues that are known to be essential for the binding of substrates and of malonyl-CoA in mammalian CPT1A. We performed PCR analyses of mRNA from different Drosophila tissues; both of the anticipated splice variants of CPT1 mRNA were found to be expressed in all of the tissues tested (both in larvae and adults), with the expression level for one of the splice variants being significantly different between flight muscle and the fat body of adult Drosophila. Heterologous expression of the full-length cDNAs corresponding to the two putative variants of Drosophila CPT1 in the yeast Pichia pastoris revealed two important differences between the properties of the two variants: (i) their affinity (K(0.5)) for one of the substrates, palmitoyl-CoA, differed by 5-fold, and (ii) the sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA at fixed, higher palmitoyl-CoA concentrations was 2-fold different and associated with different kinetics of inhibition. These data indicate that alternative splicing that specifically affects a structurally crucial region of the protein is an important mechanism through which functional diversity of CPT1 kinetics is generated from the single gene that occurs in insects.",2010,"Nigel T Price, Vicky N Jackson, Jürgen Müller, Kevin Moffat, Karen L Matthews, Tim Orton, Victor A Zammit, Nigel T Price, Vicky N Jackson, Jürgen Müller, Kevin Moffat, Karen L Matthews, Tim Orton, Victor A Zammit"
Genetic interference: don't stand so close to me,20885817,10.2174/138920210790886835,"Meiosis is a dynamic process during which chromosomes undergo condensation, pairing, crossing-over and disjunction. Stringent regulation of the distribution and quantity of meiotic crossovers is critical for proper chromosome segregation in many organisms. In humans, aberrant crossover placement and the failure to faithfully segregate meiotic chromosomes often results in severe genetic disorders such as Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome. In most sexually reproducing organisms, crossovers are more evenly spaced than would be expected from a random distribution. This phenomenon, termed interference, was first reported in the early 20(th) century by Drosophila geneticists and has been subsequently observed in a vast range of organisms from yeasts to humans. Yet, many questions regarding the behavior and mechanism of interference remain poorly understood. In this review, we examine results new and old, from a wide range of organisms, to begin to understand the progress and remaining challenges to understanding the fundamental unanswered questions regarding genetic interference.",2010,"Luke E Berchowitz, Gregory P Copenhaver, Luke E Berchowitz, Gregory P Copenhaver"
The isoforms of the p53 protein,20300206,10.1101/cshperspect.a000927,"p53 is a transcription factor with a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability and therefore preventing cancer formation. It belongs to a family of genes composed of p53, p63, and p73. The p63 and p73 genes have a dual gene structure with an internal promoter in intron-3 and together with alternative splicing, can express 6 and 29 mRNA variants, respectively. Such a complex expression pattern had not been previously described for the p53 gene, which was not consistent with our understanding of the evolution of the p53 gene family. Consequently, we revisited the human p53 gene structure and established that it encodes nine different p53 protein isoforms because of alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative initiation sites of translation. Therefore, the human p53 gene family (p53, p63, and p73) has a dual gene structure. We determined that the dual gene structure is conserved in Drosophila and in zebrafish p53 genes. The conservation through evolution of the dual gene structure suggests that the p53 isoforms play an important role in p53 tumor-suppressor activity. We and others have established that the p53 isoforms can regulate cell-fate outcome in response to stress, by modulating p53 transcriptional activity in a promoter and stress-dependent manner. We have also shown that the p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in several types of human cancers, suggesting that they play an important role in cancer formation. The determination of p53 isoforms' expression may help to link clinical outcome to p53 status and to improve cancer patient treatment.",2010,"Marie P Khoury, Jean-Christophe Bourdon, Marie P Khoury, Jean-Christophe Bourdon"
Diversification of muscle types: recent insights from Drosophila,20673829,10.1016/j.yexcr.2010.07.013,"Myogenesis is a highly conserved process ending up by the formation of contracting muscles. In Drosophila embryos, myogenesis gives rise to a segmentally repeated array of thirty distinct fibres, each of which represents an individual muscle. Since Drosophila offers a large range of genetic tools for easily testing gene functions, it has become one of the most studied and consequently best-described model organisms for muscle development. Over the last two decades, the Drosophila model system has enabled major advances in our understanding of how the initially equivalent mesodermal cells become competent for entering myogenic differentiation and how each distinct type of muscle is specified.

Drosophila p53 is required to increase the levels of the dKDM4B demethylase after UV-induced DNA damage to demethylate histone H3 lysine 9,20675387,10.1074/jbc.M110.128462,"Chromatin undergoes a variety of changes in response to UV-induced DNA damage, including histone acetylation. In human and Drosophila cells, this response is affected by mutations in the tumor suppressor p53. In this work, we report that there is a global decrease in trimethylated Lys-9 in histone H3 (H3K9me3) in salivary gland cells in wild type flies in response to UV irradiation. In contrast, flies with mutations in the Dmp53 gene have reduced basal levels of H3K9me3, which are then increased after UV irradiation. The reduction of H3K9me3 in response to DNA damage occurs preferentially in heterochromatin. Our experiments demonstrate that UV irradiation enhances the levels of Lys-9 demethylase (dKDM4B) transcript and protein in wild type flies, but not in Dmp53 mutant flies. Dmp53 binds to a DNA element in the dKdm4B gene as a response to UV irradiation. Furthermore, heterozygous mutants for the dKdm4B gene are more sensitive to UV irradiation; they are deficient in the removal of cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers, and the decrease of H3K9me3 levels following DNA damage is not observed in dKdm4B mutant flies. We propose that in response to UV irradiation, Dmp53 enhances the expression of the dKDM4B histone demethylase, which demethylates H3K9me3 preferentially in heterochromatin regions.

Evolutionary plasticity of collier function in head development of diverse arthropods,20457148,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.05.001,"The insect intercalary segment represents a small and appendage-less head segment that is homologous to the second antennal segment of Crustacea and the pedipalpal segment in Chelicerata, which are generally referred to as ""tritocerebral segment."" In Drosophila, the gene collier (col) has an important role for the formation of the intercalary segment. Here we show that in the beetle Tribolium castaneum col is required for the activation of the segment polarity genes hedgehog (hh), engrailed (en) and wingless (wg) in the intercalary segment, and is a regulatory target of the intercalary segment specific Hox gene labial (lab). Loss of Tc col function leads to increased cell death in the intercalary segment. In the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus, the loss of col function has a more severe effect in lacking the intercalary segment and also affecting the adjacent mandibular and antennal segments. By contrast, col is not expressed early in the second antennal segment in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis or in the pedipalpal segment of the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum. This suggests that the early expression of col in a stripe and its role in tritocerebral segment development is insect-specific and might correlate with the appendage-less morphology of the intercalary segment.",2010,"Nina D Schaeper, Matthias Pechmann, Wim G M Damen, Nikola-Michael Prpic, Ernst A Wimmer, Nina D Schaeper, Matthias Pechmann, Wim G M Damen, Nikola-Michael Prpic, Ernst A Wimmer"
Neuralized1 causes apoptosis and downregulates Notch target genes in medulloblastoma,20847082,10.1093/neuonc/noq091,"Neuralized (Neurl) is a highly conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase, which in Drosophila acts upon Notch ligands to regulate Notch pathway signaling. Human Neuralized1 (NEURL1) was investigated as a potential tumor suppressor in medulloblastoma (MB). The gene is located at 10q25.1, a region demonstrating frequent loss of heterozygosity in tumors. In addition, prior publications have shown that the Notch pathway is functional in a proportion of MB tumors and that Neurl1 is only expressed in differentiated cells in the developing cerebellum. In this study, NEURL1 expression was downregulated in MB compared with normal cerebellar tissue, with the lowest levels of expression in hedgehog-activated tumors. Control of gene expression by histone modification was implicated mechanistically; loss of 10q, sequence mutation, and promoter hypermethylation did not play major roles. NEURL1-transfected MB cell lines demonstrated decreased population growth, colony-forming ability, tumor sphere formation, and xenograft growth compared with controls, and a significant increase in apoptosis was seen on cell cycle and cell death analysis. Notch pathway inhibition occurred on the exogenous expression of NEURL1, as shown by decreased expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged1, and the target genes, HES1 and HEY1. From these studies, we conclude that NEURL1 is a candidate tumor suppressor in MB, at least in part through its effects on the Notch pathway.",2010,"Natalia Teider, Deborah K Scott, Adrianne Neiss, S Dilhan Weeraratne, Vladimir M Amani, Yifei Wang, Victor E Marquez, Yoon-Jae Cho, Scott L Pomeroy, Natalia Teider, Deborah K Scott, Adrianne Neiss, S Dilhan Weeraratne, Vladimir M Amani, Yifei Wang, Victor E Marquez, Yoon-Jae Cho, Scott L Pomeroy"
Rapid identification of heterozygous mutations in Drosophila melanogaster using genomic capture sequencing,20472684,10.1101/gr.102921.109,"One of the key advantages of using Drosophila melanogaster as a genetic model organism is the ability to conduct saturation mutagenesis screens to identify genes and pathways underlying a given phenotype. Despite the large number of genetic tools developed to facilitate downstream cloning of mutations obtained from such screens, the current procedure remains labor intensive, time consuming, and costly. To address this issue, we designed an efficient strategy for rapid identification of heterozygous mutations in the fly genome by combining rough genetic mapping, targeted DNA capture, and second generation sequencing technology. We first tested this method on heterozygous flies carrying either a previously characterized dac(5) or sens(E2) mutation. Targeted amplification of genomic regions near these two loci was used to enrich DNA for sequencing, and both point mutations were successfully identified. When this method was applied to uncharacterized twr mutant flies, the underlying mutation was identified as a single-base mutation in the gene Spase18-21. This targeted-genome-sequencing method reduces time and effort required for mutation cloning by up to 80% compared with the current approach and lowers the cost to <$1000 for each mutant. Introduction of this and other sequencing-based methods for mutation cloning will enable broader usage of forward genetics screens and have significant impacts in the field of model organisms such as Drosophila.",2010,"Hui Wang, Abanti Chattopadhyay, Zhe Li, Bryce Daines, Yumei Li, Chunxu Gao, Richard Gibbs, Kun Zhang, Rui Chen, Hui Wang, Abanti Chattopadhyay, Zhe Li, Bryce Daines, Yumei Li, Chunxu Gao, Richard Gibbs, Kun Zhang, Rui Chen"

In this study, we examine patterns of variation and evolution of the dmbrca2 BRC-repeat array within D. yakuba and its close relatives. We develop a model of how unequal crossing over may have produced the expanded form, but we also observe short repeat forms, typical of other species in the D. melanogaster group, segregating within D. yakuba and D. santomea. These short forms do not appear to be identical-by-descent, suggesting that the history of dmbrca2 in the D. melanogaster subgroup has involved repeat unit contractions resulting in homoplasious forms. We conclude that the evolutionary history of dmbrca2 in D. yakuba and perhaps in other Drosophila species may be more complicated than can be inferred from examination of the published single genome sequences per species.",2010,"Sarah M Bennett, John M Mercer, Mohamed A F Noor, Sarah M Bennett, John M Mercer, Mohamed A F Noor"
Transgenerational memory effect of ageing in Drosophila,20149023,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01932.x,"Children born to older parents tend to have lower intelligence and are at higher risk for disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Such observations of ageing damage being passed on from parents to offspring are not often considered within the evolutionary theory of ageing. Here, we show the 25% memory impairment in Drosophila melanogaster offspring solely dependent on the age of the parents and also passed on to the F2 generation. Furthermore, this parental age effect was not attributed to a generalized reduction in condition of the offspring but was specific to short-term memory. We also provide evidence implicating oxidative stress as a causal factor by showing that lines selected for resistance to oxidative stress did not display a memory impairment in offspring of old parents. The identification of the parental age-related memory impairment in a model system should stimulate integration between mechanistic studies of age-related mortality risk and functional studies of parental age effects on the fitness of future generations.",2010,"James G Burns, Frederic Mery, James G Burns, Frederic Mery"
Paralogous genes involved in juvenile hormone action in Drosophila melanogaster,20498297,10.1534/genetics.110.116962,"Juvenile hormone (JH) is critical for multiple aspects of insect development and physiology. Although roles for the hormone have received considerable study, an understanding of the molecules necessary for JH action in insects has been frustratingly slow to evolve. Methoprene-tolerant (Met) in Drosophila melanogaster fulfills many of the requirements for a hormone receptor gene. A paralogous gene, germ-cell expressed (gce), possesses homology and is a candidate as a Met partner in JH action. Expression of gce was found to occur at multiple times and in multiple tissues during development, similar to that previously found for Met. To probe roles of this gene in JH action, we carried out in vivo gce over- and underexpression studies. We show by overexpression studies that gce can substitute in vivo for Met, alleviating preadult but not adult phenotypic characters. We also demonstrate that RNA interference-driven knockdown of gce expression in transgenic flies results in preadult lethality in the absence of MET. These results show that (1) unlike Met, gce is a vital gene and shows functional flexibility and (2) both gene products appear to promote JH action in preadult but not adult development.",2010,"Aaron Baumann, Joshua Barry, Shaoli Wang, Yoshihiro Fujiwara, Thomas G Wilson, Aaron Baumann, Joshua Barry, Shaoli Wang, Yoshihiro Fujiwara, Thomas G Wilson"
Physiological and morphological characterization of local interneurons in the Drosophila antennal lobe,20505124,10.1152/jn.00249.2010,"The Drosophila antennal lobe (AL) has become an excellent model for studying early olfactory processing mechanisms. Local interneurons (LNs) connect a large number of glomeruli and are ideally positioned to increase computational capabilities of odor information processing in the AL. Although the neural circuit of the Drosophila AL has been intensively studied at both the input and the output level, the internal circuit is not yet well understood. An unambiguous characterization of LNs is essential to remedy this lack of knowledge. We used whole cell patch-clamp recordings and characterized four classes of LNs in detail using electrophysiological and morphological properties at the single neuron level. Each class of LN displayed unique characteristics in intrinsic electrophysiological properties, showing differences in firing patterns, degree of spike adaptation, and amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization. Notably, one class of LNs had characteristic burst firing properties, whereas the others were tonically active. Morphologically, neurons from three classes innervated almost all glomeruli, while LNs from one class innervated a specific subpopulation of glomeruli. Three-dimensional reconstruction analyses revealed general characteristics of LN morphology and further differences in dendritic density and distribution within specific glomeruli between the different classes of LNs. Additionally, we found that LNs labeled by a specific enhancer trap line (GAL4-Krasavietz), which had previously been reported as cholinergic LNs, were mostly GABAergic. The current study provides a systematic characterization of olfactory LNs in Drosophila and demonstrates that a variety of inhibitory LNs, characterized by class-specific electrophysiological and morphological properties, construct the neural circuit of the AL.",2010,"Yoichi Seki, Jürgen Rybak, Dieter Wicher, Silke Sachse, Bill S Hansson, Yoichi Seki, Jürgen Rybak, Dieter Wicher, Silke Sachse, Bill S Hansson"
Determination of penetratin secondary structure in live cells with Raman microscopy,20041639,10.1021/ja9043196,"Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have attracted recent interest as drug delivery tools, although the mechanisms by which CPPs are internalized by cells are not well-defined. Here, we report a new experimental approach for the detection and secondary structure determination of CPPs in live cells using Raman microscopy with heavy isotope labeling of the peptide. As a first demonstration of principle, penetratin, a 16-residue CPP derived from the Antennapedia homeodomain protein of Drosophila, was measured in single, living melanoma cells. Carbon-13 labeling of the Phe residue of penetratin was used to shift the intense aromatic ring-breathing vibrational mode from 1003 to 967 cm(-1), thereby enabling the peptide to be traced in cells. Difference spectroscopy and principal components analysis (PCA) were used independently to resolve the Raman spectrum of the peptide from the background cellular Raman signals. On the basis of the position of the amide I vibrational band in the Raman spectra, the secondary structure of the peptide was found to be mainly random coil and beta-strand in the cytoplasm, and possibly assembling as beta-sheets in the nucleus. The rapid entry and almost uniform cellular distribution of the peptide, as well as the lack of correlation between peptide and lipid Raman signatures, indicated that the mechanism of internalization under the conditions of study was probably nonendocytotic. This experimental approach can be used to study a wide variety of CPPs as well as other classes of peptides in living cells.",2010,"Jing Ye, Sara A Fox, Mare Cudic, Evonne M Rezler, Janelle L Lauer, Gregg B Fields, Andrew C Terentis, Jing Ye, Sara A Fox, Mare Cudic, Evonne M Rezler, Janelle L Lauer, Gregg B Fields, Andrew C Terentis"
Association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma within Drosophila neotestacea: an emerging symbiotic mutualism?,20002580,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04448.x,"Interspecific mutualism can evolve when specific lineages of different species tend to be associated with each other from one generation to the next. Different maternally transmitted endosymbionts occurring within the same cytoplasmic lineage fulfil this requirement. Drosophila neotestacea is infected with maternally transmitted Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, which are cotransmitted at high frequency in natural populations. Molecular phylogenetic evidence indicates that both endosymbionts have been present in D. neotestacea for considerable evolutionary periods. Thus, conditions are suitable for the evolution of mutualism between them. In support of this possibility, there is a significant positive association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma infection in many samples of D. neotestacea from natural populations. Theoretically, such a positive association can result from either mutualism between these endosymbionts or recent spread. Collections from present-day populations suggest that recent spread and mutualism have both operated to generate the positive association between Wolbachia and Spiroplasma. If selection acts on the combination of these two endosymbionts, they may be in the early stages of evolution of a more complex, cooperative association.",2010,"John Jaenike, Julie K Stahlhut, Lisa M Boelio, Robert L Unckless, John Jaenike, Julie K Stahlhut, Lisa M Boelio, Robert L Unckless"
Dorsal eye selector pannier (pnr) suppresses the eye fate to define dorsal margin of the Drosophila eye,20691679,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.07.030,"Axial patterning is crucial for organogenesis. During Drosophila eye development, dorso-ventral (DV) axis determination is the first lineage restriction event. The eye primordium begins with a default ventral fate, on which the dorsal eye fate is established by expression of the GATA-1 transcription factor pannier (pnr). Earlier, it was suggested that loss of pnr function induces enlargement in the dorsal eye due to ectopic equator formation. Interestingly, we found that in addition to regulating DV patterning, pnr suppresses the eye fate by downregulating the core retinal determination genes eyes absent (eya), sine oculis (so) and dacshund (dac) to define the dorsal eye margin. We found that pnr acts downstream of Ey and affects the retinal determination pathway by suppressing eya. Further analysis of the ""eye suppression"" function of pnr revealed that this function is likely mediated through suppression of the homeotic gene teashirt (tsh) and is independent of homothorax (hth), a negative regulator of eye. Pnr expression is restricted to the peripodial membrane on the dorsal eye margin, which gives rise to head structures around the eye, and pnr is not expressed in the eye disc proper that forms the retina. Thus, pnr has dual function, during early developmental stages pnr is involved in axial patterning whereas later it promotes the head specific fate. These studies will help in understanding the developmental regulation of boundary formation of the eye field on the dorsal eye margin.",2010,"Sarah M Oros, Meghana Tare, Madhuri Kango-Singh, Amit Singh, Sarah M Oros, Meghana Tare, Madhuri Kango-Singh, Amit Singh"

Açai, a fruit indigenous to the Amazon, is rich in phytochemicals that possesses high anti-oxidant activities, and has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-cardiovascular disease properties. However, little is known about its potential anti-aging properties especially at the organismal level. Here we evaluated the effect of açai pulp on modulating lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that açai supplementation at 2% in the food increased the lifespan of female flies fed a high fat diet compared to the non-supplemented control. We measured transcript changes induced by açai for age-related genes. Although transcript levels of most genes tested were not altered, açai increased the transcript level of l(2)efl, a small heat-shock-related protein, and two detoxification genes, GstD1 and MtnA, while decreasing the transcript level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), a key gene involved in gluconeogenesis. Furthermore, açai increased the lifespan of oxidative stressed females caused by sod1 RNAi. This suggests that açai improves survival of flies fed a high fat diet through activation of stress response pathways and suppression of Pepck expression. Açai has the potential to antagonize the detrimental effect of fat in the diet and alleviate oxidative stress in aging.",2010,"Xiaoping Sun, Jeanne Seeberger, Thomas Alberico, Chunxu Wang, Charles T Wheeler, Alexander G Schauss, Sige Zou, Xiaoping Sun, Jeanne Seeberger, Thomas Alberico, Chunxu Wang, Charles T Wheeler, Alexander G Schauss, Sige Zou"

This cDNA sequence encodes a 670 amino acid residue protein that contains eight consensus regions for the DEAD box protein family, 9 arginine-glycine repeats and 9 arginine-glycine-glycine repeats, a common character of known Vasa homologues. CiVasa shows high identity to that of zebrafish and other animals, suggesting Vasa is highly conserved through evolution. RT-PCR analysis reveals that in grass carp tissues, both ovaries and testes contain large amounts of vasa gene transcripts whereas no Civasa transcript is detected in somatic tissues examined. The Civasa transcripts are present at a high level from the 2 cell stage to gastrula stages which indicated that Cicasa transcripts are maternally inherited.

Hypoxia tolerance in animals: biology and application,20565233,10.1086/648581,"Many invertebrates and ectothermic vertebrates successfully cope with a fluctuating supply of ambient oxygen-and consequently, a highly variable tissue oxygenation-through increasing their antioxidant barriers.

Normally, much of an organism's gene response to hypoxia is orchestrated via the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF. Recent developments expand our view of HIF function even further by highlighting regulatory roles for HIF in the hypometabolism of insects, in the molting and the normoxic immune response of crustaceans, and in the control-via the downstream effector gene erythropoietin-of the hypoxic ventilatory response and pulmonary hypertension in mammals.

BREs mediate both repression and activation of oskar mRNA translation and act in trans,20230756,10.1016/j.devcel.2009.12.021,"Asymmetric positioning of proteins within cells is crucial for cell polarization and function. Deployment of Oskar protein at the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte relies on localization of the oskar mRNA, repression of its translation prior to localization, and finally activation of translation. Translational repression is mediated by BREs, regulatory elements positioned in two clusters near both ends of the oskar mRNA 3' UTR. Here we show that some BREs are bifunctional: both clusters of BREs contribute to translational repression, and the 3' cluster has an additional role in release from BRE-dependent repression. Remarkably, both BRE functions can be provided in trans by an oskar mRNA with wild-type BREs that is itself unable to encode Oskar protein. Regulation in trans is likely enabled by assembly of oskar transcripts in cytoplasmic RNPs. Concentration of transcripts in such RNPs is common, and trans regulation of mRNAs may therefore be widespread.",2010,"Brad Reveal, Nan Yan, Mark J Snee, Chin-I Pai, Youme Gim, Paul M Macdonald, Brad Reveal, Nan Yan, Mark J Snee, Chin-I Pai, Youme Gim, Paul M Macdonald"
Inhibition of microRNA-14 contributes to actinomycin-D-induced apoptosis in the Sf9 insect cell line,20486901,10.1042/CBI20100035,"Actinomycin-D (Act-D) and other inhibitors of RNA synthesis induce extensive and rapid apoptosis in the lepidopteran insect cells. Interestingly, a similar effect is not observed in the case of protein synthesis shutdown, implying that certain RNA species may be critically required for cell survival. In order to assess whether depletion of certain anti-apoptotic microRNAs may result in insect cell apoptosis induced by these transcriptional inhibitors, we inhibited two antiapoptotic microRNAs, viz. bantam and miR-14 (microRNA-14), with known functions in insect systems, by transfecting lepidopteran Sf9 cell line (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda) with sequence-specific inhibitory anti-miRs. Our results indicate that miR-14 is indeed required for constitutive cell survival as its inhibition caused considerable apoptosis. Importantly, exogenous supplementation with the mimics of miR-14 precursor molecules could partially inhibit the Act-D-induced Sf9 cell death. Further, our results indicate that miR-14 may function downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release in preventing Act-D-induced apoptosis, implying possible inhibitory interactions with caspases as reported previously in other organisms. While the microRNA species are known to regulate cell death in Drosophila, which belongs the insect order Diptera, the present study demonstrates a definitive antiapoptotic role of miR-14 in lepidopteran apoptosis as well. Our study also indicates that additional microRNA species may be regulating lepidopteran cell survival and death, thus warranting further in-depth investigations into these important mechanisms of cell death.

Here, I present analyses of the genetic architecture underlying hybrid male sterility and segregation distortion between the Bogota and USA subspecies of Drosophila pseudoobscura. Previously, a single gene, Overdrive (Ovd), was shown to be necessary but not sufficient for both male sterility and segregation distortion in F(1) hybrids between these subspecies, requiring several interacting partner loci for full manifestation of hybrid phenomena. I map these partner loci separately on the Bogota X chromosome and USA autosomes using a combination of different mapping strategies. I find that hybrid sterility involves a single hybrid incompatibility of at least seven interacting partner genes that includes three large-effect loci. Segregation distortion involves three loci on the Bogota X chromosome and one locus on the autosomes. The genetic bases of hybrid sterility and segregation distortion are at least partially--but not completely--overlapping. My results lay the foundation for fine-mapping experiments to identify the complete set of genes that interact with Overdrive. While individual genes that cause hybrid sterility or inviability have been identified in a few cases, my analysis provides a comprehensive look at the genetic architecture of all components of a hybrid incompatibility underlying F(1) hybrid sterility. Such an analysis would likely be unfeasible for most species pairs due to their divergence time and emphasizes the importance of young species pairs such as the D. pseudoobscura subspecies studied here.",2011,"Nitin Phadnis, Nitin Phadnis"
Population genomics of transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster,21172826,10.1093/molbev/msq337,"Transposable elements (TEs) are the primary contributors to the genome bulk in many organisms and are major players in genome evolution. A clear and thorough understanding of the population dynamics of TEs is therefore essential for full comprehension of the eukaryotic genome evolution and function. Although TEs in Drosophila melanogaster have received much attention, population dynamics of most TE families in this species remains entirely unexplored. It is not clear whether the same population processes can account for the population behaviors of all TEs in Drosophila or whether, as has been suggested previously, different orders behave according to very different rules. In this work, we analyzed population frequencies for a large number of individual TEs (755 TEs) in five North American and one sub-Saharan African D. melanogaster populations (75 strains in total). These TEs have been annotated in the reference D. melanogaster euchromatic genome and have been sampled from all three major orders (non-LTR, LTR, and TIR) and from all families with more than 20 TE copies (55 families in total). We find strong evidence that TEs in Drosophila across all orders and families are subject to purifying selection at the level of ectopic recombination. We showed that strength of this selection varies predictably with recombination rate, length of individual TEs, and copy number and length of other TEs in the same family. Importantly, these rules do not appear to vary across orders. Finally, we built a statistical model that considered only individual TE-level (such as the TE length) and family-level properties (such as the copy number) and were able to explain more than 40% of the variation in TE frequencies in D. melanogaster.",2011,"Dmitri A Petrov, Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier, Mikhail Lipatov, Kapa Lenkov, Josefa González, Dmitri A Petrov, Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier, Mikhail Lipatov, Kapa Lenkov, Josefa González"

Heterologous expression in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that each receptor functioned as a D(1)-like dopamine receptor because significant increases in levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were detected following dopamine treatment. Importantly, the receptors were distinct in their pharmacological properties regarding concentration-dependent response to dopamine, constitutive activity, and response to other biogenic amines.

Desiccation resistance and mating behaviour in laboratory populations of Drosophila simulans originating from the opposing slopes of Lower Nahal Oren (Israel),21696478,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02341.x,"Lower Nahal Oren in Northern Israel, often referred to as 'Evolution Canyon', has been proposed as a microscale model site for ecological evolution.

In this study, we further tested the Nahal Oren model, while extending its focus from Drosophila melanogaster to its sister species, Drosophila simulans. Using fly populations derived from the opposing canyon slopes and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 11-22 generations, we did not find a significant slope effect on desiccation resistance (P = 0.96) or body metabolic fuel content (P > 0.43), which would indicate a genetic basis for adaptation to local resource limitation. Multiple-choice mating assays (47-48% homotypic couples in two replicate populations) did not indicate divergence from a random mating pattern between north- and south-facing slope flies.

Environmental temperature modulates olfactory reception in Drosophila melanogaster,21924272,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.08.016,"Sensory systems, including the olfactory system, are able to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In nature, changes in temperature modify the volatility and concentration of odorants in the air. If the olfactory system does not adapt to these changes, it could relay wrong information about the distance to or direction of odor sources. Recent behavioral studies in Drosophila melanogaster showed olfactory acclimation to temperature. In this report, we investigated if temperature affects olfaction at the level of the receptors themselves. With this aim, we performed electroantennograms (EAGs) and single sensillum recordings (SSRs) to measure the response to several odorants in flies that had been submitted to temperature treatments. In response to all tested odorants, the amplitude of the EAGs increased in flies that had been exposed to a higher temperature and decreased after cold treatment, revealing that at least part of the reported change in olfactory perception happens at reception level. SSRs of odorant stimulated basiconic sensilla ab2 and ab3 showed some changes in the number of spikes after heat or cold treatment. However, the number and shape of spontaneous action potentials were unaffected, suggesting that the observed changes related specifically to the olfactory function of the neurons.",2011,"Fernando Martin, Jacob Riveron, Esther Alcorta, Fernando Martin, Jacob Riveron, Esther Alcorta"
Perturbation analysis of 6DoF flight dynamics and passive dynamic stability of hovering fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,21093456,10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.11.022,"Insects exhibit exquisite control of their flapping flight, capable of performing precise stability and steering maneuverability. Here we develop an integrated computational model to investigate flight dynamics of insect hovering based on coupling the equations of 6 degree of freedom (6DoF) motion with the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Unsteady aerodynamics is resolved by using a biology-inspired dynamic flight simulator that integrates models of realistic wing-body morphology and kinematics, and a NS solver. We further develop a dynamic model to solve the rigid body equations of 6DoF motion by using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta method. In this model, instantaneous forces and moments based on the NS-solutions are represented in terms of Fourier series. With this model, we perform a systematic simulation-based analysis on the passive dynamic stability of a hovering fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, with a specific focus on responses of state variables to six one-directional perturbation conditions during latency period. Our results reveal that the flight dynamics of fruit fly hovering does not have a straightforward dynamic stability in a conventional sense that perturbations damp out in a manner of monotonous convergence. However, it is found to exist a transient interval containing an initial converging response observed for all the six perturbation variables and a terminal instability that at least one state variable subsequently tends to diverge after several wing beat cycles. Furthermore, our results illustrate that a fruit fly does have sufficient time to apply some active mediation to sustain a steady hovering before losing body attitudes.",2011,"Na Gao, Hikaru Aono, Hao Liu, Na Gao, Hikaru Aono, Hao Liu"

Molecular evolution under increasing transposable element burden in Drosophila: a speed limit on the evolutionary arms race,21917173,10.1186/1471-2148-11-258,"Background:
        
      
      Genome architecture is profoundly influenced by transposable elements (TEs), and natural selection against their harmful effects is a critical factor limiting their spread. Genome defense by the piRNA silencing pathway also plays a crucial role in limiting TE proliferation. How these two forces jointly determine TE abundance is not well understood. To shed light on the nature of factors that predict TE success, we test three distinct hypotheses in the Drosophila genus. First, we determine whether TE abundance and relaxed genome-wide purifying selection on protein sequences are positively correlated. This serves to test the hypothesis that variation in TE abundance in the Drosophila genus can be explained by the strength of natural selection, relative to drift, acting in parallel against mildly deleterious non-synonymous mutations. Second, we test whether increasing TE abundance is correlated with an increased rate of amino-acid evolution in genes encoding the piRNA machinery, as might be predicted by an evolutionary arms race model. Third, we test whether increasing TE abundance is correlated with greater codon bias in genes of the piRNA machinery. This is predicted if increasing TE abundance selects for increased efficiency in the machinery of genome defense.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Surprisingly, we find neither of the first two hypotheses to be true. Specifically, we found that genome-wide levels of purifying selection, measured by the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (ω), were greater in species with greater TE abundance. In addition, species with greater TE abundance have greater levels of purifying selection in the piRNA machinery. In contrast, it appears that increasing TE abundance has primarily driven adaptation in the piRNA machinery by increasing codon bias.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      These results indicate that within the Drosophila genus, a historically reduced strength of selection relative to drift is unlikely to explain patterns of increased TE success across species. Other factors, such as ecological exposure, are likely to contribute to variation in TE abundances within species. Furthermore, constraints on the piRNA machinery may temper the evolutionary arms race that would drive increasing rates of evolution at the amino acid level. In the face of these constraints, selection may act primarily by improving the translational efficiency of the machinery of genome defense through efficient codon usage.",2011,"Dean M Castillo, Joshua Chang Mell, Kimberly S Box, Justin P Blumenstiel, Dean M Castillo, Joshua Chang Mell, Kimberly S Box, Justin P Blumenstiel"
Testing chromosomal phylogenies and inversion breakpoint reuse in Drosophila. The martensis cluster revisited,21394512,10.1007/s10577-011-9195-6,"The chromosomal relationships of the four martensis cluster species are among the most complex and intricate within the entire Drosophila repleta group, due to the so-called sharing of inversions. Here, we have revised these relationships using comparative mapping of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones on the salivary gland chromosomes. A physical map of chromosome 2 of Drosophila uniseta (one of the cluster members) was generated by in situ hybridization of 82 BAC clones from the physical map of the Drosophila buzzatii genome (an outgroup that represents the ancestral arrangement). By comparing the marker positions, we determined the number, order, and orientation of conserved chromosomal segments between chromosome 2 of D. buzzatii and D. uniseta. GRIMM software was used to infer that a minimum of five chromosomal inversions are necessary to transform the chromosome 2 of D. buzzatii into that of D. uniseta. Two of these inversions have been overlooked in previous cytological analyses. The five fixed inversions entail two breakpoint reuses because only nine syntenic segments and eight interruptions were observed. We tested for the presence of the five inversions fixed in D. uniseta in the other three species of the martensis cluster by in situ hybridization of eight breakpoint-bearing BAC clones.

Neurotransmitter Transporter-Like: a male germline-specific SLC6 transporter required for Drosophila spermiogenesis,21298005,10.1371/journal.pone.0016275,"The SLC6 class of membrane transporters, known primarily as neurotransmitter transporters, is increasingly appreciated for its roles in nutritional uptake of amino acids and other developmentally specific functions. A Drosophila SLC6 gene, Neurotransmitter transporter-like (Ntl), is expressed only in the male germline. Mobilization of a transposon inserted near the 3' end of the Ntl coding region yields male-sterile mutants defining a single complementation group. Germline transformation with Ntl cDNAs under control of male germline-specific control elements restores Ntl/Ntl homozygotes to normal fertility, indicating that Ntl is required only in the germ cells. In mutant males, sperm morphogenesis appears normal, with elongated, individualized and coiled spermiogenic cysts accumulating at the base of the testes. However, no sperm are transferred to the seminal vesicle. The level of polyglycylation of Ntl mutant sperm tubulin appears to be significantly lower than that of wild type controls. Glycine transporters are the most closely related SLC6 transporters to Ntl, suggesting that Ntl functions as a glycine transporter in developing sperm, where augmentation of the cytosolic pool of glycine may be required for the polyglycylation of the massive amounts of tubulin in the fly's giant sperm. The male-sterile phenotype of Ntl mutants may provide a powerful genetic system for studying the function of an SLC6 transporter family in a model organism.",2011,"Nabanita Chatterjee, Janet Rollins, Anthony P Mahowald, Christopher Bazinet, Nabanita Chatterjee, Janet Rollins, Anthony P Mahowald, Christopher Bazinet"
Noncanonical compensation of zygotic X transcription in early Drosophila melanogaster development revealed through single-embryo RNA-seq,21346796,10.1371/journal.pbio.1000590,"When Drosophila melanogaster embryos initiate zygotic transcription around mitotic cycle 10, the dose-sensitive expression of specialized genes on the X chromosome triggers a sex-determination cascade that, among other things, compensates for differences in sex chromosome dose by hypertranscribing the single X chromosome in males. However, there is an approximately 1 hour delay between the onset of zygotic transcription and the establishment of canonical dosage compensation near the end of mitotic cycle 14. During this time, zygotic transcription drives segmentation, cellularization, and other important developmental events. Since many of the genes involved in these processes are on the X chromosome, we wondered whether they are transcribed at higher levels in females and whether this might lead to sex-specific early embryonic patterning. To investigate this possibility, we developed methods to precisely stage, sex, and characterize the transcriptomes of individual embryos. We measured genome-wide mRNA abundance in male and female embryos at eight timepoints, spanning mitotic cycle 10 through late cycle 14, using polymorphisms between parental lines to distinguish maternal and zygotic transcription. We found limited sex-specific zygotic transcription, with a weak tendency for genes on the X to be expressed at higher levels in females. However, transcripts derived from the single X chromosome in males were more abundant that those derived from either X chromosome in females, demonstrating that there is widespread dosage compensation prior to the activation of the canonical MSL-mediated dosage compensation system. Crucially, this new system of early zygotic dosage compensation results in nearly identical transcript levels for key X-linked developmental regulators, including giant (gt), brinker (brk), buttonhead (btd), and short gastrulation (sog), in male and female embryos.",2011,"Susan E Lott, Jacqueline E Villalta, Gary P Schroth, Shujun Luo, Leath A Tonkin, Michael B Eisen, Susan E Lott, Jacqueline E Villalta, Gary P Schroth, Shujun Luo, Leath A Tonkin, Michael B Eisen"
High-dimensional variance partitioning reveals the modular genetic basis of adaptive divergence in gene expression during reproductive character displacement,22023580,10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01371.x,"Although adaptive change is usually associated with complex changes in phenotype, few genetic investigations have been conducted on adaptations that involve sets of high-dimensional traits. Microarrays have supplied high-dimensional descriptions of gene expression, and phenotypic change resulting from adaptation often results in large-scale changes in gene expression. We demonstrate how genetic analysis of large-scale changes in gene expression generated during adaptation can be accomplished by determining high-dimensional variance partitioning within classical genetic experimental designs. A microarray experiment conducted on a panel of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from two populations of Drosophila serrata that have diverged in response to natural selection, revealed genetic divergence in 10.6% of 3762 gene products examined. Over 97% of the genetic divergence in transcript abundance was explained by only 12 genetic modules. The two most important modules, explaining 50% of the genetic variance in transcript abundance, were genetically correlated with the morphological traits that are known to be under selection. The expression of three candidate genes from these two important genetic modules was assessed in an independent experiment using qRT-PCR on 430 individuals from the panel of RILs, and confirmed the genetic association between transcript abundance and morphological traits under selection.",2011,"Elizabeth A McGraw, Yixin H Ye, Brad Foley, Stephen F Chenoweth, Megan Higgie, Emma Hine, Mark W Blows, Elizabeth A McGraw, Yixin H Ye, Brad Foley, Stephen F Chenoweth, Megan Higgie, Emma Hine, Mark W Blows"
Developmental stability: a major role for cyclin G in drosophila melanogaster,21998598,10.1371/journal.pgen.1002314,"Morphological consistency in metazoans is remarkable given the pervasive occurrence of genetic variation, environmental effects, and developmental noise. Developmental stability, the ability to reduce developmental noise, is a fundamental property of multicellular organisms, yet its genetic bases remains elusive. Imperfect bilateral symmetry, or fluctuating asymmetry, is commonly used to estimate developmental stability. We observed that Drosophila melanogaster overexpressing Cyclin G (CycG) exhibit wing asymmetry clearly detectable by sight. Quantification of wing size and shape using geometric morphometrics reveals that this asymmetry is a genuine-but extreme-fluctuating asymmetry. Overexpression of CycG indeed leads to a 40-fold increase of wing fluctuating asymmetry, which is an unprecedented effect, for any organ and in any animal model, either in wild populations or mutants. This asymmetry effect is not restricted to wings, since femur length is affected as well. Inactivating CycG by RNAi also induces fluctuating asymmetry but to a lesser extent. Investigating the cellular bases of the phenotypic effects of CycG deregulation, we found that misregulation of cell size is predominant in asymmetric flies. In particular, the tight negative correlation between cell size and cell number observed in wild-type flies is impaired when CycG is upregulated. Our results highlight the role of CycG in the control of developmental stability in D. melanogaster. Furthermore, they show that wing developmental stability is normally ensured via compensatory processes between cell growth and cell proliferation. We discuss the possible role of CycG as a hub in a genetic network that controls developmental stability.",2011,"Vincent Debat, Sébastien Bloyer, Floria Faradji, Nelly Gidaszewski, Nicolas Navarro, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, Valérie Ribeiro, Christian Schlötterer, Jean S Deutsch, Frédérique Peronnet, Vincent Debat, Sébastien Bloyer, Floria Faradji, Nelly Gidaszewski, Nicolas Navarro, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, Valérie Ribeiro, Christian Schlötterer, Jean S Deutsch, Frédérique Peronnet"
Functional dissection of phosphorylation of Disheveled in Drosophila,21963539,10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.09.017,"Disheveled/Dsh proteins (Dvl in mammals) are core components of both Wnt/Wg-signaling pathways: canonical β-catenin signaling and Frizzled (Fz)-planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling. Although Dsh is a key cytoplasmic component of both Wnt/Fz-pathways, regulation of its signaling specificity is not well understood. Dsh is phosphorylated, but the functional significance of its phosphorylation remains unclear. We have systematically investigated the phosphorylation of Dsh by combining mass-spectrometry analyses, biochemical studies, and in vivo genetic methods in Drosophila. Our approaches identified multiple phospho-residues of Dsh in vivo. Our data define three novel and unexpected conclusions: (1) strikingly and in contrast to common assumptions, all conserved serines/threonines are non-essential for Dsh function in either pathway; (2) phosphorylation of conserved Tyrosine473 in the DEP domain is critical for PCP-signaling - Dsh(Y473F) behaves like a PCP-specific allele; and (3) defects associated with the PCP specific dsh(1) allele, Dsh(K417M), located within a putative Protein Kinase C consensus site, are likely due to a post-translational modification requirement of Lys417, rather than phosphorylation nearby. In summary, our combined data indicate that while many Ser/Thr and Tyr residues are indeed phosphorylated in vivo, strikingly most of these phosphorylation events are not critical for Dsh function with the exception of DshY473.",2011,"Wang A Yanfeng, Hebist Berhane, Marion Mola, Jaskirat Singh, Andreas Jenny, Marek Mlodzik, Wang A Yanfeng, Hebist Berhane, Marion Mola, Jaskirat Singh, Andreas Jenny, Marek Mlodzik"
Notch signaling regulates neuroepithelial stem cell maintenance and neuroblast formation in Drosophila optic lobe development,21146517,10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.12.002,"Notch signaling mediates multiple developmental decisions in Drosophila. In this study, we have examined the role of Notch signaling in Drosophila larval optic lobe development. Loss of function in Notch or its ligand Delta leads to loss of the lamina and a smaller medulla. The neuroepithelial cells in the optic lobe in Notch or Delta mutant brains do not expand but instead differentiate prematurely into medulla neuroblasts, which lead to premature neurogenesis in the medulla. Clonal analyses of loss-of-function alleles for the pathway components, including N, Dl, Su(H), and E(spl)-C, indicate that the Delta/Notch/Su(H) pathway is required for both maintaining the neuroepithelial stem cells and inhibiting medulla neuroblast formation while E(spl)-C is only required for some aspects of the inhibition of medulla neuroblast formation. Conversely, Notch pathway overactivation promotes neuroepithelial cell expansion while suppressing medulla neuroblast formation and neurogenesis; numb loss of function mimics Notch overactivation, suggesting that Numb may inhibit Notch signaling activity in the optic lobe neuroepithelial cells. Thus, our results show that Notch signaling plays a dual role in optic lobe development, by maintaining the neuroepithelial stem cells and promoting their expansion while inhibiting their differentiation into medulla neuroblasts. These roles of Notch signaling are strikingly similar to those of the JAK/STAT pathway in optic lobe development, raising the possibility that these pathways may collaborate to control neuroepithelial stem cell maintenance and expansion, and their differentiation into the progenitor cells.",2011,"Wei Wang, Wenke Liu, Yue Wang, Liya Zhou, Xiaofang Tang, Hong Luo, Wei Wang, Wenke Liu, Yue Wang, Liya Zhou, Xiaofang Tang, Hong Luo"
Consumption of bitter alkaloids in Drosophila melanogaster in multiple-choice test conditions,21173029,10.1093/chemse/bjq133,"Drosophila melanogaster adapt their food consumption to their internal needs and avoid ingesting noxious molecules. Defects in the genes involved in these decisions induce behavioral alterations that are usually screened by monitoring flies feeding in 2-choice or in no-choice situations. Here, we introduce a new behavioral test in which groups of flies are given access to 6 capillary feeders (MultiCAFE) containing fructose mixed with a serial dilution of a test substance. Using quinine, we first showed that fly density, distance between capillaries, and order of presentation have a minor impact on the discrimination performances of the flies. Fly discrimination was also only marginally affected by the type of test (no-choice, binary, or multiple-choice). Interestingly, the feeding reduction was well correlated with a reduction of the firing elicited by the mixture in sugar-sensitive gustatory receptor neurons, suggesting that several mechanisms concur to allow flies to make their choices. In addition to quinine, flies exhibited marked dose-dependent aversions to the consumption of berberine, caffeine, lobeline, nicotine, papaverine, strychnine, and theophylline, which all taste bitter to humans. Thus, despite of the multiplicity of choices available, flies consistently avoid alkaloids mixed with a sugar solution, and their choices are strongly dependent on their taste system. The MultiCAFE assay represents an interesting alternative to other feeding tests, in that it allows monitoring of the absolute consumption while also requiring less flies and time to run than other assays.",2011,"Marie-Jeanne Sellier, Pablo Reeb, Frédéric Marion-Poll, Marie-Jeanne Sellier, Pablo Reeb, Frédéric Marion-Poll"
msl2 mRNA is bound by free nuclear MSL complex in Drosophila melanogaster,21551218,10.1093/nar/gkr236,"In Drosophila, the global increase in transcription from the male X chromosome to compensate for its monosomy is mediated by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex consisting of five proteins and two non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2. After an initial sequence-dependent recognition by the MSL complex of 150-300 high affinity sites, the spread to the majority of the X-linked genes depends on local MSL-complex concentration and active transcription. We have explored whether any additional RNA species are associated with the MSL complex. No additional roX RNA species were found, but a strong association was found between a spliced and poly-adenylated msl2 RNA and the MSL complex.

Increased vesicular glutamate transporter expression causes excitotoxic neurodegeneration,20951206,10.1016/j.nbd.2010.10.009,"Increases in vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) levels are observed after a variety of insults including hypoxic injury, stress, methamphetamine treatment, and in genetic seizure models. Such overexpression can cause an increase in the amount of glutamate released from each vesicle, but it is unknown whether this is sufficient to induce excitotoxic neurodegeneration. Here we show that overexpression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (DVGLUT) leads to excess glutamate release, with some vesicles releasing several times the normal amount of glutamate. Increased DVGLUT expression also leads to an age-dependent loss of motor function and shortened lifespan, accompanied by a progressive neurodegeneration in the postsynaptic targets of the DVGLUT-overexpressing neurons. The early onset lethality, behavioral deficits, and neuronal pathology require overexpression of a functional DVGLUT transgene. Thus overexpression of DVGLUT is sufficient to generate excitotoxic neuropathological phenotypes and therefore reducing VGLUT levels after nervous system injury or stress may mitigate further damage.",2011,"Richard W Daniels, Bradley R Miller, Aaron DiAntonio, Richard W Daniels, Bradley R Miller, Aaron DiAntonio"

The OMRV genome was observed to consist of a nonsegmented, 7.6-kb double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and contain two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1 and ORF2. ORF1 was found to encode a putative dsRNA-binding protein, a major capsid protein, and other putative proteins, which might be generated by co- and/or post-translational processing of the ORF1 polyprotein precursor, and ORF2 was found to encode a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which could be translated as a fusion with the ORF1 product by a -1 ribosomal frameshift. Phylogenetic analysis based on RdRp revealed that OMRV is closely related to penaeid shrimp infectious myonecrosis virus and Drosophila totivirus, which are tentatively assigned to the family Totiviridae.

Population invasion by Wolbachia depends on levels of cytoplasmic incompatibility, fitness effects, and maternal transmission. Here we characterized these traits in an outbred genetic background of a potential target population of Ae. aegypti using two crossing schemes. Cytoplasmic incompatibility was strong in this background, and the maternal transmission rate of Wolbachia was high. The infection substantially reduced longevity of infected adult females, regardless of whether adults came from larvae cultured under high or low levels of nutrition or density. The infection reduced the viability of diapausing and nondiapausing eggs. Viability was particularly low when eggs were laid by older females and when diapausing eggs had been stored for a few weeks. The infection affected mosquito larval development time and adult body size under different larval nutrition levels and densities. The results were used to assess the potential for wMelPop-CLA to invade natural populations of Ae. aegypti and to develop recommendations for the maintenance of fitness in infected mosquitoes that need to compete against field insects.",2011,"H L Yeap, P Mee, T Walker, A R Weeks, S L O'Neill, P Johnson, S A Ritchie, K M Richardson, C Doig, N M Endersby, A A Hoffmann, H L Yeap, P Mee, T Walker, A R Weeks, S L O'Neill, P Johnson, S A Ritchie, K M Richardson, C Doig, N M Endersby, A A Hoffmann"
The DOCK protein sponge binds to ELMO and functions in Drosophila embryonic CNS development,21283588,10.1371/journal.pone.0016120,"Cell morphogenesis, which requires rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, is essential to coordinate the development of tissues such as the musculature and nervous system during normal embryonic development. One class of signaling proteins that regulate actin cytoskeletal rearrangement is the evolutionarily conserved CDM (C. elegansCed-5, human DOCK180, DrosophilaMyoblast city, or Mbc) family of proteins, which function as unconventional guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the small GTPase Rac. This CDM-Rac protein complex is sufficient for Rac activation, but is enhanced upon the association of CDM proteins with the ELMO/Ced-12 family of proteins. We identified and characterized the role of Drosophila Sponge (Spg), the vertebrate DOCK3/DOCK4 counterpart as an ELMO-interacting protein. Our analysis shows Spg mRNA and protein is expressed in the visceral musculature and developing nervous system, suggesting a role for Spg in later embryogenesis. As maternal null mutants of spg die early in development, we utilized genetic interaction analysis to uncover the role of Spg in central nervous system (CNS) development. Consistent with its role in ELMO-dependent pathways, we found genetic interactions with spg and elmo mutants exhibited aberrant axonal defects. In addition, our data suggests Ncad may be responsible for recruiting Spg to the membrane, possibly in CNS development. Our findings not only characterize the role of a new DOCK family member, but help to further understand the role of signaling downstream of N-cadherin in neuronal development.",2011,"Bridget Biersmith, Ze Cindy Liu, Kenneth Bauman, Erika R Geisbrecht, Bridget Biersmith, Ze Cindy Liu, Kenneth Bauman, Erika R Geisbrecht"
The biological function of the Huntingtin protein and its relevance to Huntington's Disease pathology,22180703,,"Huntington's Disease is an adult-onset dominant heritable disorder characterized by progressive psychiatric disruption, cognitive deficits, and loss of motor coordination. It is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the N-terminal domain of the Huntingtin protein. The mutation confers a toxic gain-of-function phenotype, resulting in neurodegeneration that is most severe in the striatum. Increasing experimental evidence from genetic model systems such as mice, zebrafish, and Drosophila suggest that polyglutamine expansion within the Huntingtin protein also disrupts its normal biological function. Huntingtin is widely expressed during development and has a complex and dynamic distribution within cells. It is predicted to be a protein of pleiotropic function, interacting with a large number of effector proteins to mediate a host of physiological processes. In this review, we highlight the wildtype function of Huntingtin, focusing on its postdevelopmental roles in axonal trafficking, regulation of gene transcription, and cell survival. We then discuss how potential loss-of-function phenotypes resulting in polyglutamine expansion within Huntingtin may have direct relevance to the underlying pathophysiology of Huntington's Disease.",2011,"Joost Schulte, J Troy Littleton, Joost Schulte, J Troy Littleton"
PhyloCSF: a comparative genomics method to distinguish protein coding and non-coding regions,21685081,10.1093/bioinformatics/btr209,"Motivation:
        
      
      As high-throughput transcriptome sequencing provides evidence for novel transcripts in many species, there is a renewed need for accurate methods to classify small genomic regions as protein coding or non-coding. We present PhyloCSF, a novel comparative genomics method that analyzes a multispecies nucleotide sequence alignment to determine whether it is likely to represent a conserved protein-coding region, based on a formal statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We show that PhyloCSF's classification performance in 12-species Drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other methods we compared in a previous study. We anticipate that this method will be widely applicable as the transcriptomes of many additional species, tissues and subcellular compartments are sequenced, particularly in the context of ENCODE and modENCODE, and as interest grows in long non-coding RNAs, often initially recognized by their lack of protein coding potential rather than conserved RNA secondary structures.

Once a cancer has acquired the ability to colonize new sites in the body it becomes dramatically more difficult to treat. This has made it a focus of much of cancer research. The humble fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has despite its relative simplicity, made significant contributions to the understanding of tumor progression. In this review we outline and highlight those with an emphasis on modeling the genetic and epigenetic changes required for invasion and metastasis. We will revisit the early years of cancer modeling in Drosophila where the first parallels were drawn between Drosophila and vertebrate neoplasms and highlight recent advances using genetic screens and interactions with the epithelial microenvironment and innate immune system.

Dietary protein and sugar differentially affect development and metabolic pools in ecologically diverse Drosophila,21525254,10.3945/jn.111.138438,"We examined the effects of 3 diets differing in their relative levels of sugar and protein on development and metabolic pools (protein, TG, and glycogen) among sets of isofemale lines of 2 ecologically distinct Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. mojavensis. Our high protein:sugar ratio diet contained 7.1% protein and 17.9% carbohydrate, the EPS diet was 4.3% protein and 21.2% carbohydrate, and the LPS was only 2.5% protein and 24.6% carbohydrate. Larvae of D. melanogaster, a generalist fruit breeder, were able to survive on all 3 diets, although all 3 metabolic pools responded with significant diet and diet × line interactions. Development was delayed by the diet with the most sugar relative to protein. The other species, D. mojavensis, a cactus breeder ecologically unaccustomed to encountering simple sugars, completely failed to survive when fed the diet with the highest sugar and showed very poor survival even with the diet with equal parts of protein and sugar. Furthermore, the D. mojavensis adult metabolic pools of protein, TG, and glycogen significantly differed from those of D. melanogaster adults fed the identical diet. Thus, considerable within- and between-species differences exist in how diets are metabolized. Given that the genomes of both of these Drosophila species have been sequenced, these differences and their genetic underpinnings hold promise for understanding human responses to nutrition and for developing strategies for dealing with metabolic disease.",2011,"Luciano M Matzkin, Sarah Johnson, Christopher Paight, Goran Bozinovic, Therese A Markow, Luciano M Matzkin, Sarah Johnson, Christopher Paight, Goran Bozinovic, Therese A Markow"

This chapter describes a high-resolution FISH protocol for the detection of RNA expression and localization dynamics in embryos and tissues of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The approach utilizes tyramide signal amplification (TSA) for enhanced sensitivity and resolution in the detection of coding and noncoding RNAs, for the codetection of different RNA species or of RNA and a protein marker of interest.

Interactions between detoxification mechanisms and excretion in Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,21228205,10.1242/jeb.048884,"Insects have long been known to excrete toxins via the Malpighian (renal) tubules. In addition, exposure to natural or synthetic toxins is commonly associated with increases in the activity of detoxification enzymes such as the P450 monoxygenases (P450s) and the glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). We examined the links between mechanisms for detoxification and excretion in adult Drosophila melanogaster using functional assays and measurements of changes in gene expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in response to dietary exposure to compounds known to alter activity or gene expression of P450s and GSTs. Dietary exposure to phenol, which alters gene expression for multiple GSTs after seven to 10 generations, was also associated with an increase (more than twofold) in secretion of the organic anion methotrexate (MTX) by isolated tubules. Dietary exposure to the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was associated with reduced expression of two P450 genes (Cyp4e2, Cyp4p1) and two GST genes (GstD1, GstD5) in the tubules, as well as increased expression of Cyp12d1 and GstE1. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of fluid secreted by isolated tubules indicated that dietary exposure to PBO resulted in increased levels of an MTX metabolite. In addition, exposure to PBO altered the expression of transporter genes in the tubules, including a Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein, and was associated with a 73% increase in MTX secretion by isolated tubules. The results suggest that exposure of Drosophila to toxins evokes a coordinated response by the Malpighian tubules, involving both alterations in detoxification pathways as well as enhanced transport.",2011,"Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell, Sarah Chahine, Michael J O'Donnell"
A suppressor/enhancer screen in Drosophila reveals a role for wnt-mediated lipid metabolism in primordial germ cell migration,22069480,10.1371/journal.pone.0026993,"Wnt proteins comprise a large family of secreted ligands implicated in a wide variety of biological roles. WntD has previously been shown to inhibit the nuclear accumulation of Dorsal/NF-κB protein during embryonic dorsal/ventral patterning and the adult innate immune response, independent of the well-studied Armadillo/β-catenin pathway. In this paper, we present a novel phenotype for WntD mutant embryos, suggesting that this gene is involved in migration of primordial germ cells (PGC) to the embryonic gonad. Additionally, we describe a genetic suppressor/enhancer screen aimed at identifying genes required for WntD signal transduction, based on the previous observation that maternal overexpression of WntD results in lethally dorsalized embryos. Using an algorithm to narrow down our hits from the screen, we found two novel WntD signaling components: Fz4, a member of the Frizzled family, and the Drosophila Ceramide Kinase homolog, Dcerk. We show here that Dcerk and Dmulk (Drosophila Multi-substrate lipid kinase) redundantly mediate PGC migration. Our data are consistent with a model in which the activity of lipid phosphate phosphatases shapes a concentration gradient of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), the product of Dcerk, allowing proper PGC migration.",2011,"Mark A McElwain, Dennis C Ko, Michael D Gordon, Henrik Fyrst, Julie D Saba, Roel Nusse, Mark A McElwain, Dennis C Ko, Michael D Gordon, Henrik Fyrst, Julie D Saba, Roel Nusse"
NUMB-ing down cancer by more than just a NOTCH,20940030,10.1016/j.bbcan.2010.10.001,"The protein Numb does not live up to its name. This passive-sounding protein is anything but spent. Originally identified as a cell-fate determinant in Drosophila development, Numb received a good deal of attention as an inhibitor of the Notch receptor signaling pathway. It turns out, however, that Numb does a lot more than simply regulate Notch. It has been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways connected with signaling (it regulates Notch-, Hedgehog- and TP53-activated pathways), endocytosis (it is involved in cargo internalization and recycling), determination of polarity (it interacts with the PAR complex, and regulates adherens and tight junctions), and ubiquitination (it exploits this mechanism to regulate protein function and stability). This complex biochemical network lies at the heart of Numb's involvement in diverse cellular phenotypes, including cell fate developmental decisions, maintenance of stem cell compartments, regulation of cell polarity and adhesion, and migration. Considering its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that Numb has been implicated in cancer as a tumor suppressor. Our major goal here is to explain the cancer-related role of Numb based on our understanding of its role in cell physiology. We will attempt to do this by reviewing the present knowledge of Numb at the biochemical and functional level, and by integrating its apparently heterogeneous functions into a unifying scenario, based on our recently proposed concept of the ""endocytic matrix"". Finally, we will discuss the role of Numb in the maintenance of the normal stem cell compartment, as a starting point to interpret the tumor suppressor function of Numb in the context of the cancer stem cell hypothesis.",2011,"Salvatore Pece, Stefano Confalonieri, Pascale R Romano, Pier Paolo Di Fiore, Salvatore Pece, Stefano Confalonieri, Pascale R Romano, Pier Paolo Di Fiore"
Anastral spindle assembly and γ-tubulin in Drosophila oocytes,21208439,10.1186/1471-2121-12-1,"Background:
        
      
      Anastral spindles assemble by a mechanism that involves microtubule nucleation and growth from chromatin. It is still uncertain whether γ-tubulin, a microtubule nucleator essential for mitotic spindle assembly and maintenance, plays a role. Not only is the requirement for γ-tubulin to form anastral Drosophila oocyte meiosis I spindles controversial, but its presence in oocyte meiosis I spindles has not been demonstrated and is uncertain.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We show, for the first time, using a bright GFP fusion protein and live imaging, that the Drosophila maternally-expressed γTub37C is present at low levels in oocyte meiosis I spindles. Despite this, we find that formation of bipolar meiosis I spindles does not require functional γTub37C, extending previous findings by others. Fluorescence photobleaching assays show rapid recovery of γTub37C in the meiosis I spindle, similar to the cytoplasm, indicating weak binding by γTub37C to spindles, and fits of a new, potentially more accurate model for fluorescence recovery yield kinetic parameters consistent with transient, diffusional binding.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      The FRAP results, together with its mutant effects late in meiosis I, indicate that γTub37C may perform a role subsequent to metaphase I, rather than nucleating microtubules for meiosis I spindle formation. Weak binding to the meiosis I spindle could stabilize pre-existing microtubules or position γ-tubulin for function during meiosis II spindle assembly, which follows rapidly upon oocyte activation and completion of the meiosis I division.",2011,"Sharyn A Endow, Mark A Hallen, Sharyn A Endow, Mark A Hallen"
Heterogeneous periodicity of drosophila mtDNA: new refutations of neutral and nearly neutral evolution,22688916,,"We found a consistent 3-site periodicity of the X²9 values for the heterogeneity of the distribution of the second base in relation to the first base of dinucleotides separated by 0 (contiguous), 1, 2, 3 ... 17 (K) nucleotide sites in Drosophila mtDNA. Triplets of X²9 values were found where the first was over 300 and the second and third ranged between 37 and 114 (previous studies). In this study, the periodicity was significant until separation of 2011K, and a structure of deviations from randomness among dinucleotides was found. The most deviant dinucleotides were G-G, G-C and C-G for the first, second and third element of the triplet, respectively. In these three cases there were more dinucleotides observed than expected. This inter-bases correlation and periodicity may be related to the tertiary structure of circular DNA, like that of prokaryotes and mitochondria, to protect and preserve it. The mtDNA with 19.517 bp was divided into four equal segments of 4.879 bp. The fourth sub-segment presented a very low proportion of G and C, the internucleotide interaction was weaker in this sub-segment and no periodicity was found. The maintenance of this mtDNA structure and organization for millions of generations, in spite of a high recurrent mutation rate, does not support the notion of neutralism or near neutralism. The high level of internucleotide interaction and periodicity indicate that every nucleotide is co-adapted with the residual genome.",2011,"Carlos Y Valenzuela, Carlos Y Valenzuela"

Building an ommatidium one cell at a time,22174084,10.1002/dvdy.23707,"Since the discovery of a single white-eyed male in a population of red eyed flies over 100 years ago (Morgan, 1910), the compound eye of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been a favorite experimental system for identifying genes that regulate various aspects of development. For example, a fair amount of what we know today about enzymatic pathways and vesicular transport is due to the discovery and subsequent characterization of eye color mutants such as white. Likewise, our present day understanding of organogenesis has been aided considerably by studies of mutations, such as eyeless, that either reduce or eliminate the compound eyes. But by far the phenotype that has provided levers into the greatest number of experimental fields has been the humble ""rough"" eye. The fly eye is composed of several hundred unit-eyes that are also called ommatidia. These unit eyes are packed into a hexagonal array of remarkable precision. The structure of the eye is so precise that it has been compared with that of a crystal (Ready et al., 1976). Even the slightest perturbations to the structure of the ommatidium can be visually detected by light or electron microscopy. The cause for this is two-fold: (1) any defect that affects the hexagonal geometry of a single ommatidium can and will disrupt the positioning of surrounding unit eyes thereby propagating structural flaws and (2) disruptions in genes that govern the development of even a single cell within an ommatidium will affect all unit eyes. In both cases, the effect is the visual magnification of even the smallest imperfection. Studies of rough eye mutants have provided key insights into the areas of cell fate specification, lateral inhibition, signal transduction, transcription factor networks, planar cell polarity, cell proliferation, and programmed cell death just to name a few.

The conserved P body component HPat/Pat1 negatively regulates synaptic terminal growth at the larval Drosophila neuromuscular junction,23097047,10.1242/jcs.113043,"The temporal and spatial regulation of protein synthesis plays an important role in the control of neural physiology. In axons and dendrites, translationally repressed mRNAs are actively transported to their destinations in a variety of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). A subset of these neuronal RNPs has been shown to contain proteins associated with mRNA processing bodies (P bodies). P bodies are a class of highly conserved cytoplasmic granules that have been linked to both mRNA decay and translational repression via general and miRNA-mediated pathways. Here, we characterize functions for HPat/Pat1 (also known as Patr-1), a core component of P bodies, at the glutamatergic larval Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). We show that hpat mutants exhibit a strong synaptic hyperplasia at the NMJ. The synaptic defects observed in hpat mutants are associated with rearrangement of the axonal microtubule cytoskeleton suggesting that HPat negatively regulates presynaptic microtubule-based growth during NMJ development. Consistent with this, overexpression of HPat also blocks the rapid growth of presynaptic boutons induced by spaced depolarization. Finally, we demonstrate that HPat interacts genetically with the catalytic subunit of the deadenylase complex (twin/CCR4) and the miRNA pathway (Argonaute 1) to control bouton formation. We propose that HPat is required to target mRNAs involved in the control of microtubule architecture and synaptic terminal growth for repression, presumably in P bodies, via both general and miRNA-mediated mechanisms.",2012,"Sarala J Pradhan, Katherine R Nesler, Sarah F Rosen, Yasuko Kato, Akira Nakamura, Mani Ramaswami, Scott A Barbee, Sarala J Pradhan, Katherine R Nesler, Sarah F Rosen, Yasuko Kato, Akira Nakamura, Mani Ramaswami, Scott A Barbee"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for bluetongue virus replication and tropism,22674991,10.1128/JVI.00131-12,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the etiological agent of bluetongue (BT), a hemorrhagic disease of ruminants that can cause high levels of morbidity and mortality. BTV is an arbovirus transmitted between its ruminant hosts by Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Recently, Europe has experienced some of the largest BT outbreaks ever recorded, including areas with no known history of the disease, leading to unprecedented economic and animal welfare issues. The current lack of genomic resources and genetic tools for Culicoides restricts any detailed study of the mechanisms involved in the virus-insect interactions. In contrast, the genome of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) has been successfully sequenced, and it is used extensively as a model of molecular pathways due to the existence of powerful genetic technology. In this study, D. melanogaster is investigated as a model for the replication and tropism of BTV. Using reverse genetics, a modified BTV-1 that expresses the fluorescent mCherry protein fused to the viral nonstructural protein NS3 (BTV-1/NS3mCherry) was generated. We demonstrate that BTV-1/NS3mCherry is not only replication competent as it retains many characteristics of the wild-type virus but also replicates efficiently in D. melanogaster after removal of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis by antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, confocal microscopy shows that the tissue tropism of BTV-1/NS3mCherry in D. melanogaster resembles that described previously for BTV in Culicoides.

Individual plastic responses by males to rivals reveal mismatches between behaviour and fitness outcomes,22438501,10.1098/rspb.2012.0235,"Plasticity in behaviour is of fundamental significance when environments are variable. Such plasticity is particularly important in the context of rapid changes in the socio-sexual environment. Males can exhibit adaptive plastic responses to variation in the overall level of reproductive competition. However, the extent of behavioural flexibility within individuals, and the degree to which rapidly changing plastic responses map onto fitness are unknown. We addressed this by determining the behaviour and fitness profiles of individual Drosophila melanogaster males subjected to up to three episodes of exposure to rivals or no rivals, in all combinations. Behaviour (mating duration) was remarkably sensitive to the level of competition and fully reversible, suggesting that substantial costs arise from the incorrect expression of even highly flexible behaviour. However, changes in mating duration matched fitness outcomes (offspring number) only in scenarios in which males experienced zero then high competition. Following the removal of competition, mating duration, but not offspring production, decreased to below control levels. This indicates that the benefit of increasing reproductive investment when encountering rivals may exceed that of decreasing investment when rivals disappear. Such asymmetric fitness benefits and mismatches with behavioural responses are expected to exert strong selection on the evolution of plasticity.",2012,"Amanda Bretman, James D Westmancoat, Matthew J G Gage, Tracey Chapman, Amanda Bretman, James D Westmancoat, Matthew J G Gage, Tracey Chapman"
No evidence of sexual selection in a repetition of Bateman's classic study of Drosophila melanogaster,22689966,10.1073/pnas.1207851109,"We are unique in reporting a repetition of Bateman [Bateman AJ (1948) Heredity (Edinb) 2:349-368] using his methods of parentage assignment, which linked sex differences in variance of reproductive success and variance in number of mates in small populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using offspring phenotypes, we inferred who mated with whom and assigned offspring to parents. Like Bateman, we cultured adults expressing dramatic phenotypes, so that each adult was heterozygous-dominant at its unique marker locus but had only wild-type alleles at all other subjects' marker loci. Assuming no viability effects of parental markers on offspring, the frequencies of parental phenotypes in offspring follow mendelian expectations: one-quarter will be double-mutants who inherit the dominant gene from each parent, the offspring from which Bateman counted the number of mates per breeder; half of the offspring must be single mutants inheriting the dominant gene of one parent and the wild-type allele of the other parent; and one-quarter would inherit neither of their parent's marker mutations. Here we show that inviability of double-mutant offspring biased inferences of mate number and number of offspring on which rest inferences of sex differences in fitness variances. Bateman's method overestimated subjects with zero mates, underestimated subjects with one or more mates, and produced systematically biased estimates of offspring number by sex. Bateman's methodology mismeasured fitness variances that are the key variables of sexual selection.",2012,"Patricia Adair Gowaty, Yong-Kyu Kim, Wyatt W Anderson, Patricia Adair Gowaty, Yong-Kyu Kim, Wyatt W Anderson"

Often, their use is combined in a synergistic fashion to alter and engineer the fruit fly genome. Transposons are the foundation for all transgenic technologies in flies and hence almost all innovations in the fruit fly. They have been instrumental in the generation of genome-wide collections of insertions for gene disruption and manipulation. Many important transgenic strains of these collections are available from public repositories. The Flp protein is the most widely used recombinase to induce mitotic clones to study individual gene function. However, Flp has also been used to generate chromosome- and genome-wide collections of precise deletions, inversions, and duplications. Similarly, transposons that contain attP attachment sites for the ΦC31 integrase can be used for numerous applications. This integrase was incorporated into a transgenesis system that allows the integration of small to very large DNA fragments that can be easily manipulated through recombineering. This system allowed the creation of genomic DNA libraries for genome-wide gene manipulations and X chromosome duplications. Moreover, the attP sites are being used to create libraries of tens of thousands of RNAi constructs and tissue-specific GAL4 lines.

Prion-induced toxicity in PrP transgenic Drosophila,22314254,10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.01.005,"Prion diseases are fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of humans and various vertebrate species. In their natural hosts these conditions are characterised by prolonged incubation times prior to the onset of clinical signs of terminal disease. Accordingly, tractable models of mammalian prion disease are required in order to better understand the mechanisms of prion replication and prion-induced neurotoxicity. Transmission of prion diseases can occur across a species barrier and this is facilitated in recipients transgenic for the same PrP gene as the individual from which the infectious prions are derived. Here we have tested the hypothesis that exogenous ovine prions can induce neurotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for ovine PrP. Drosophila that expressed ovine PrP pan neuronally and inoculated with ovine prions at the larval stage by oral exposure to scrapie-infected sheep brain homogenate showed markedly accelerated locomotor and survival defects. ARQ PrP transgenic Drosophila exposed to scrapie-infected brain homogenate showed a significant and progressive reduction in locomotor activity compared to similar flies exposed to normal sheep brain homogenate. The prion-induced locomotor defect was accompanied by the accumulation of potentially misfolded PrP in the brains of prion-inoculated flies. VRQ PrP transgenic Drosophila, which expressed less ovine PrP than ARQ flies, showed a reduced median survival compared to similar flies exposed to normal sheep brain homogenate.

"Molecular Modelling of Oligomeric States of DmOR83b, an Olfactory Receptor in D. Melanogaster",22493562,10.4137/BBI.S8990,"After the discovery of the complete repertoire of D. melanogaster Olfactory Receptors (ORs), candidate ORs have been identified from at least 12 insect species from four orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera), including species of economic or medical importance. Although all ORs share the same G-protein coupled receptor structure with seven transmembrane domains, they share poor sequence identity within and between species, and have been identified mainly through genomic data analyses. To date, D. melanogaster remains the only insect species where ORs have been extensively studied, from expression pattern establishment to functional investigations. These studies have confirmed several observations made in vertebrates: one OR type is selectively expressed in a subtype of olfactory receptor neurons, and one olfactory neuron expresses only one type of OR. The olfactory mechanism, further, appears to be conserved between insects and vertebrates. Understanding the function of insect ORs will greatly contribute to the understanding of insect chemical communication mechanisms, particularly with agricultural pests and disease vectors, and could result in future strategies to reduce their negative effects. In this study, we propose molecular models for insect olfactory receptor co-receptor OR83b and its possible functional oligomeric states. The functional similarity of OR83b to GPCRs and ion channels has been exploited for understanding the structure of OR83b. We could observe that C-terminal region (TM4-7) of OR83b is involved in homodimer amd heterodimer formation (with OR22a) which suggests why C-terminus of insect ORs are highly conserved across different species. We also propose two possible ion channel pathways in OR83b: one formed by TM4-5 region with intracellular pore-forming domain and the other formed by TM5-6 with extracellular pore forming domain using analysis of the electrostatics distribution of the pore forming domain.",2012,"K Harini, R Sowdhamini, K Harini, R Sowdhamini"
Germ granules in spermatogenesis of Drosophila: Evidences of contribution to the piRNA silencing,22808315,10.4161/cib.18741,"Ribonucleoprotein-containing granules in the cytoplasm of germinal cells are known to be a common attribute of eukaryotic organisms. Germ granules appear to ensure the posttranscriptional regulation of germline mRNAs. Recent studies specify the participation of the germ granules in genome integrity maintenance by mechanisms involving short piRNAs. PIWI clade proteins and associated piRNAs are considered as key participants of the germline-specific piRNA pathway. Proteins of the PIWI clade, Aub and AGO3, concentrated in the germline-specific perinuclear granules called nuage, are involved in silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome. In Drosophila testes, two types of perinuclear nuage granules are found: a large amount of small particles around the nuclei and significantly larger structures, the piNG-bodies. In this mini-review, we analyze the recent published data about structure and functions of Drosophila male germ granules, and especially their involvement in the piRNA silencing pathway.",2012,"Mikhail V Kibanov, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Ludmila V Olenina, Mikhail V Kibanov, Vladimir A Gvozdev, Ludmila V Olenina"

The time-consuming task to generate these samples makes such screens less attractive. Here, we describe the use of multi-well filter plates for high throughput labellings of different Drosophila organs and zebrafish embryos.

"Crumbs regulates polarity and prevents light-induced degeneration of the simple eyes of Drosophila, the ocelli",22608020,10.1016/j.ejcb.2012.03.006,"The evolutionary conserved transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb) regulates morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells in the compound eye of Drosophila and prevents light-dependent retinal degeneration. Here we examine the role of Crb in the ocelli, the simple eyes of Drosophila. We show that Crb is expressed in ocellar photoreceptor cells, where it defines a stalk membrane apical to the adherens junctions, similar as in photoreceptor cells of the compound eyes. Loss of function of crb disrupts polarity of ocellar photoreceptor cells, and results in mislocalisation of adherens junction proteins. This phenotype is more severe than that observed in mutant photoreceptor cells of the compound eye, and resembles more that of embryonic epithelia lacking crb. Similar as in compound eyes, crb protects ocellar photoreceptors from light induced degeneration, a function that depends on the extracellular portion of the Crb protein. Our data demonstrate that the function of crb in photoreceptor development and homeostasis is conserved in compound eyes and ocelli and underscores the evolutionarily relationship between these visual sense organs of Drosophila. The data will be discussed with respect to the difference in apico-basal organisation of these two cell types.",2012,"Monalisa Mishra, Michaela Rentsch, Elisabeth Knust, Monalisa Mishra, Michaela Rentsch, Elisabeth Knust"
Drosophila neuroligin 2 is required presynaptically and postsynaptically for proper synaptic differentiation and synaptic transmission,23136438,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1685-12.2012,"Trans-synaptic adhesion between Neurexins (Nrxs) and Neuroligins (Nlgs) is thought to be required for proper synapse organization and modulation, and mutations in several human Nlgs have shown association with autism spectrum disorders. Here we report the generation and phenotypic characterization of Drosophila neuroligin 2 (dnlg2) mutants. Loss of dnlg2 results in reduced bouton numbers, aberrant presynaptic and postsynaptic development at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and impaired synaptic transmission. In dnlg2 mutants, the evoked responses are decreased in amplitude, whereas the total active zone (AZ) numbers at the NMJ are comparable to wild type, suggesting a decrease in the release probability. Ultrastructurally, the presynaptic AZ number per bouton area and the postsynaptic density area are both increased in dnlg2 mutants, whereas the subsynaptic reticulum is reduced in volume. We show that both presynaptic and postsynaptic expression of Dnlg2 is required to restore synaptic growth and function in dnlg2 mutants. Postsynaptic expression of Dnlg2 in dnlg2 mutants and wild type leads to reduced bouton growth whereas presynaptic and postsynaptic overexpression in wild-type animals results in synaptic overgrowth. Since Nlgs have been shown to bind to Nrxs, we created double mutants. These mutants are viable and display phenotypes that closely resemble those of dnlg2 and dnrx single mutants. Our results provide compelling evidence that Dnlg2 functions both presynaptically and postsynaptically together with Neurexin to determine the proper number of boutons as well as the number of AZs and size of synaptic densities during the development of NMJs.",2012,"Yu-Chi Chen, Yong Qi Lin, Swati Banerjee, Koen Venken, Jingjun Li, Afshan Ismat, Kuchuan Chen, Lita Duraine, Hugo J Bellen, Manzoor A Bhat, Yu-Chi Chen, Yong Qi Lin, Swati Banerjee, Koen Venken, Jingjun Li, Afshan Ismat, Kuchuan Chen, Lita Duraine, Hugo J Bellen, Manzoor A Bhat"
"A novel, sensitive assay for behavioral defects in Parkinson's disease model Drosophila",22888468,10.1155/2012/697564,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder with the pathology of α-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies. Currently, there is no available therapy that arrests the progression of the disease. Therefore, the need of animal models to follow α-synuclein aggregation is crucial. Drosophila melanogaster has been researched extensively as a good genetic model for the disease, with a cognitive phenotype of defective climbing ability. The assay for climbing ability has been demonstrated as an effective tool for screening new therapeutic agents for Parkinson's disease. However, due to the assay's many limitations, there is a clear need to develop a better behavioral test. Courtship, a stereotyped, ritualized behavior of Drosophila, involves complex motor and sensory functions in both sexes, which are controlled by large number of neurons; hence, behavior observed during courtship should be sensitive to disease processes in the nervous system. We used a series of traits commonly observed in courtship and an additional behavioral trait-nonsexual encounters-and analyzed them using a data mining tool. We found defective behavior of the Parkinson's model male flies that were tested with virgin females, visible at a much younger age than the climbing defects.

A nuclear-derived proteinaceous matrix embeds the microtubule spindle apparatus during mitosis,22855526,10.1091/mbc.E12-06-0429,"The concept of a spindle matrix has long been proposed. Whether such a structure exists, however, and what its molecular and structural composition are have remained controversial. In this study, using a live-imaging approach in Drosophila syncytial embryos, we demonstrate that nuclear proteins reorganize during mitosis to form a highly dynamic, viscous spindle matrix that embeds the microtubule spindle apparatus, stretching from pole to pole. We show that this ""internal"" matrix is a distinct structure from the microtubule spindle and from a lamin B-containing spindle envelope. By injection of 2000-kDa dextran, we show that the disassembling nuclear envelope does not present a diffusion barrier. Furthermore, when microtubules are depolymerized with colchicine just before metaphase the spindle matrix contracts and coalesces around the chromosomes, suggesting that microtubules act as ""struts"" stretching the spindle matrix. In addition, we demonstrate that the spindle matrix protein Megator requires its coiled-coil amino-terminal domain for spindle matrix localization, suggesting that specific interactions between spindle matrix molecules are necessary for them to form a complex confined to the spindle region. The demonstration of an embedding spindle matrix lays the groundwork for a more complete understanding of microtubule dynamics and of the viscoelastic properties of the spindle during cell division.",2012,"Changfu Yao, Uttama Rath, Helder Maiato, David Sharp, Jack Girton, Kristen M Johansen, Jørgen Johansen, Changfu Yao, Uttama Rath, Helder Maiato, David Sharp, Jack Girton, Kristen M Johansen, Jørgen Johansen"

Influence of mating histories and age on female remating behaviour in a few closely related species of Drosophila nasuta subgroup,22670479,,"Female remating with more than one male leads to coexistence of sperm from different males in the same female, thus creating a selection pressure on sperm. To understand the extent of divergence in the reproductive behaviour among closely related species, in the present study, the influence of first mating histories like mating latency, duration of copulation and age of flies have been analysed on female remating behaviour in closely related Drosophila nasuta subgroup species with varying levels of reproductive isolation. The time taken for the once mated females to remate varied from 7 days in D. s. sulfurigaster to 19 days in D. s. neonasuta after first mating. The female remating frequency varied from a minimum of 29% in D. s. neonasuta to a maximum of 95% in D. s. sulfurigaster. The younger flies, which had remating latency of three times less than aged flies, show 100% remating frequency. In addition, it was observed that the duration of copulation in the first mating influences the remating behaviour among the nasuta subgroup members.

Pigment-dispersing factor is involved in age-dependent rhythm changes in Drosophila melanogaster,23223368,10.1177/0748730412462206,"Most animals show rest/activity rhythms that are regulated by an endogenous timing mechanism, the so-called circadian system. The rhythm becomes weaker with age, but the mechanism underlying the age-associated rhythm change remains to be elucidated. Here we employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study the aging effects on the rhythm. We first investigated activity rhythms under light-dark (LD) cycles and constant darkness (DD) in young (1-day-old) and middle-aged (30-, 40-, and 50-day-old) wild-type male flies. The middle-aged flies showed a reduced activity level in comparison with young flies. Additionally, the free-running period significantly lengthened in DD, and the rhythm strength was diminished. Immunohistochemistry against pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), a principal neurotransmitter of the Drosophila clock, revealed that PDF levels declined with age. We also found an attenuation of TIMELESS (TIM) oscillation in the cerebral clock neurons in elder flies. Intriguingly, overexpression of PDF suppressed age-associated changes not only in the period and strength of free-running locomotor rhythms but also in the amplitude of TIM oscillations in many pacemaker neurons in the elder flies, suggesting that the age-dependent PDF decline is responsible for the rhythm attenuation. These results suggest that the age-associated reduction of PDF may cause attenuation of intercellular communication in the circadian neuronal network and of TIM cycling, which may result in the age-related rhythm decay.",2012,"Yujiro Umezaki, Taishi Yoshii, Tomoaki Kawaguchi, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Kenji Tomioka, Yujiro Umezaki, Taishi Yoshii, Tomoaki Kawaguchi, Charlotte Helfrich-Förster, Kenji Tomioka"

Inhibition of SPG polyploidy caused rupture of the septate junctions necessary for the blood-brain barrier. Thus, the increased SPG cell size resulting from polyploidization is required to maintain the SPG envelope surrounding the growing brain.

Functional interactions between Fat family cadherins in tissue morphogenesis and planar polarity,22510986,10.1242/dev.077461,"The atypical cadherin fat (ft) was originally discovered as a tumor suppressor in Drosophila and later shown to regulate a form of tissue patterning known as planar polarity. In mammals, four ft homologs have been identified (Fat1-4). Recently, we demonstrated that Fat4 plays a role in vertebrate planar polarity. Fat4 has the highest homology to ft, whereas other Fat family members are homologous to the second ft-like gene, ft2. Genetic studies in flies and mice imply significant functional differences between the two groups of Fat cadherins. Here, we demonstrate that Fat family proteins act both synergistically and antagonistically to influence multiple aspects of tissue morphogenesis. We find that Fat1 and Fat4 cooperate during mouse development to control renal tubular elongation, cochlear extension, cranial neural tube formation and patterning of outer hair cells in the cochlea. Similarly, Fat3 and Fat4 synergize to drive vertebral arch fusion at the dorsal midline during caudal vertebra morphogenesis. We provide evidence that these effects depend on conserved interactions with planar polarity signaling components. In flies, the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin (Atro) physically interacts with Ft and acts as a component of Fat signaling for planar polarity. We find that the mammalian orthologs of atro, Atn1 and Atn2l, modulate Fat4 activity during vertebral arch fusion and renal tubular elongation, respectively. Moreover, Fat4 morphogenetic defects are enhanced by mutations in Vangl2, a 'core' planar cell polarity gene. These studies highlight the wide range and complexity of Fat activities and suggest that a Fat-Atrophin interaction is a conserved element of planar polarity signaling.",2012,"Sakura Saburi, Ian Hester, Lisa Goodrich, Helen McNeill, Sakura Saburi, Ian Hester, Lisa Goodrich, Helen McNeill"
takeout-dependent longevity is associated with altered Juvenile Hormone signaling,22940452,10.1016/j.mad.2012.08.004,"In order to understand the molecular mechanisms of longevity regulation, we recently performed a screen designed to enrich for genes common to several longevity interventions. Using this approach, we identified the Drosophila melanogaster gene takeout. takeout is upregulated in a variety of long-lived flies, and extends life span when overexpressed. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of takeout-dependent longevity. takeout overexpression specifically in the fat body is sufficient to increase fly longevity and is additive to the longevity effects of Dietary Restriction. takeout long-lived flies do not show phenotypes often associated with increased longevity, such as enhanced stress resistance or major metabolic abnormalities. However, males exhibit greatly diminished courtship behavior, leading to a reduction in fertility. Interestingly, takeout contains a binding domain for Juvenile Hormone, a fly hormone that plays a role in the regulation of developmental transitions. Importantly, the longevity and courtship phenotypes of takeout overexpressing flies are reversed by treatment with the Juvenile Hormone analog methoprene. These data suggest that takeout is a key player in the tradeoff-switch between fertility and longevity. takeout may control fertility via modulation of courtship behavior. This regulation may occur through Juvenile Hormone binding to takeout and a subsequent reduction in Juvenile Hormone signaling activity.",2012,"Khalil H Chamseddin, Sabina Q Khan, Mai L H Nguyen, Michael Antosh, Siti Nur Sarah Morris, Santharam Kolli, Nicola Neretti, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer, Khalil H Chamseddin, Sabina Q Khan, Mai L H Nguyen, Michael Antosh, Siti Nur Sarah Morris, Santharam Kolli, Nicola Neretti, Stephen L Helfand, Johannes H Bauer"
The Drosophila Arf1 homologue Arf79F is essential for lamellipodium formation,22992458,10.1242/jcs.108092,"The WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) drives the polymerisation of actin filaments located beneath the plasma membrane to generate lamellipodia that are pivotal to cell architecture and movement. By reconstituting WRC-dependent actin assembly at the membrane, we recently discovered that several classes of Arf family GTPases directly recruit and activate WRC in cell extracts, and that Arf cooperates with Rac1 to trigger actin polymerisation. Here, we demonstrate that the Class 1 Arf1 homologue Arf79F colocalises with the WRC at dynamic lamellipodia. We report that Arf79F is required for lamellipodium formation in Drosophila S2R+ cells, which only express one Arf isoform for each class. Impeding Arf function either by dominant-negative Arf expression or by Arf double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi)-mediated knockdown uncovered that Arf-dependent lamellipodium formation was specific to Arf79F, establishing that Class 1 Arfs, but not Class 2 or Class 3 Arfs, are crucial for lamellipodia. Lamellipodium formation in Arf79F-silenced cells was restored by expressing mammalian Arf1, but not by constitutively active Rac1, showing that Arf79F does not act via Rac1. Abolition of lamellipodium formation in Arf79F-silenced cells was not due to Golgi disruption. Blocking Arf79F activation with guanine nucleotide exchange factor inhibitors impaired WRC localisation to the plasma membrane and concomitant generation of lamellipodia. Our data indicate that the Class I Arf GTPase is a central component in WRC-driven lamellipodium formation.",2012,"Daniel Humphreys, Tao Liu, Anthony C Davidson, Peter J Hume, Vassilis Koronakis, Daniel Humphreys, Tao Liu, Anthony C Davidson, Peter J Hume, Vassilis Koronakis"
Recombination modulates how selection affects linked sites in Drosophila,23152720,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001422,"One of the most influential observations in molecular evolution has been a strong association between local recombination rate and nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. This is interpreted as evidence for ubiquitous natural selection. The alternative explanation, that recombination is mutagenic, has been rejected by the absence of a similar association between local recombination rate and nucleotide divergence between species. However, many recent studies show that recombination rates are often very different even in closely related species, questioning whether an association between recombination rate and divergence between species has been tested satisfactorily. To circumvent this problem, we directly surveyed recombination across approximately 43% of the D. pseudoobscura physical genome in two separate recombination maps and 31% of the D. miranda physical genome, and we identified both global and local differences in recombination rate between these two closely related species. Using only regions with conserved recombination rates between and within species and accounting for multiple covariates, our data support the conclusion that recombination is positively related to diversity because recombination modulates Hill-Robertson effects in the genome and not because recombination is predominately mutagenic. Finally, we find evidence for dips in diversity around nonsynonymous substitutions.

Transgenic epigenetics: using transgenic organisms to examine epigenetic phenomena,22567397,10.1155/2012/689819,"Non-model organisms are generally more difficult and/or time consuming to work with than model organisms. In addition, epigenetic analysis of model organisms is facilitated by well-established protocols, and commercially-available reagents and kits that may not be available for, or previously tested on, non-model organisms.

Interestingly, while transgenic Drosophila and mice have provided significant insight into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary conservation of the epigenetic processes that target epigenetic control regions in other model organisms, this method has so far been under-exploited for non-model organism epigenetic analysis. This paper details several experiments that have examined the epigenetic processes of genomic imprinting and paramutation, by transferring an epigenetic control region from one model organism to another.

Courtship song analysis of Drosophila muscle mutants,21945578,10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.09.007,"As part of the mating ritual, males of Drosophila species produce species-specific courtship songs through wing vibrations generated by the thoracic musculature. While previous studies have shown that indirect flight muscles (IFM) are neurally activated during courtship song production, the precise role of these muscles in song production has not been investigated. Fortunately, IFM mutants abound in Drosophila melanogaster and studies spanning several decades have shed light on the role of muscle proteins in IFM-powered flight. Analysis of courtship songs in these mutants offers the opportunity to uncover the role of the IFM in a behavior distinct than flight and subject to different evolutionary selection regimes. Here, we describe protocols for the recording and analysis of courtship behavior and mating song of D. melanogaster muscle transgenic and mutant strains. To record faint acoustic signal of courtship songs, an insulated mating compartment was used inside a recording device (INSECTAVOX) equipped with a modified electret microphone, a low-noise power supply, and noise filters. Songs recorded in the INSECTAVOX are digitized using Goldwave, whose several features enable extraction of critical song parameters, including carrier frequencies for pulse song and sine song.

Evolution of reproductive isolation as a by-product of divergent life-history evolution in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster,23301185,10.1002/ece3.413,"We show that two complementary asymmetric isolating mechanisms, likely mediated by divergence in body size, underlie the evolution of incipient reproductive isolation between a set of Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for rapid development and their ancestral controls. Selection has led to great reduction in body size in the fast developing lines. Small males belonging to fast developing lines obtain few matings with large control females, both in presence and absence of large control line males, giving rise to unidirectional, premating isolation caused by sexual selection. Conversely, small selected line females suffer greatly increased mortality following mating with large control males, causing unidirectional postcopulatory prezygotic isolation. We discuss preliminary evidence for evolution of reduced male harm caused to females upon mating in the fast developing lines, and speculate that the females from these lines have coevolved reduced resistance to male harm such that they can no longer resist the harm caused by males from control lines. This potentially implicates differing levels of sexual conflict in creating reproductive barrier between the selected line females and the control males. We also show that a large difference in development time is not sufficient to cause postzygotic incompatibilities in the two sets of populations reaffirming the belief that prezygotic isolation can evolve much earlier than postzygotic isolation.",2012,"Shampa M Ghosh, Amitabh Joshi, Shampa M Ghosh, Amitabh Joshi"

Flying Drosophila orient to sky polarization,22177905,10.1016/j.cub.2011.11.026,"Insects maintain a constant bearing across a wide range of spatial scales. Monarch butterflies and locusts traverse continents [1, 2], and foraging bees and ants travel hundreds of meters to return to their nests [1, 3, 4], whereas many other insects fly straight for only a few centimeters before changing direction. Despite this variation in spatial scale, the brain region thought to underlie long-distance navigation is remarkably conserved [5, 6], suggesting that the use of a celestial compass is a general and perhaps ancient capability of insects. Laboratory studies of Drosophila have identified a local search mode in which short, straight segments are interspersed with rapid turns [7, 8]. However, this flight mode is inconsistent with measured gene flow between geographically separated populations [9-11], and individual Drosophila can travel 10 km across desert terrain in a single night [9, 12, 13]-a feat that would be impossible without prolonged periods of straight flight. To directly examine orientation behavior under outdoor conditions, we built a portable flight arena in which a fly viewed the natural sky through a liquid crystal device that could experimentally rotate the polarization angle.

Mechanism of evenness interrupted (Evi)-exosome release at synaptic boutons,22437826,10.1074/jbc.M112.342667,"Wnt signaling plays critical roles during synaptic development and plasticity. However, the mechanisms by which Wnts are released and travel to target cells are unresolved. During synaptic development, the secretion of Drosophila Wnt1, Wingless, requires the function of Evenness Interrupted (Evi)/Wls, a Wingless-binding protein that is secreted along with Wingless at the neuromuscular junction. Given that Evi is a transmembrane protein, these studies suggested the presence of a novel vesicular mechanism of trans-synaptic communication, potentially in the form of exosomes. To establish the mechanisms for the release of Evi vesicles, we used a dsRNA assay in cultured cells to screen for genes that when down-regulated prevent the release of Evi vesicles. We identified two proteins, Rab11 and Syntaxin 1A (Syx1A), that were required for Evi vesicle release. To determine whether the same mechanisms were used in vivo at the neuromuscular junction, we altered the activity of Rab11 and Syx1A in motoneurons and determined the impact on Evi release. We found that Syx1A, Rab11, and its effector Myosin5 were required for proper Evi vesicle release. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons demonstrated the presence of multivesicular bodies, organelles involved in the production and release of exosomes, and these multivesicular bodies contained Evi.

δ-Aminolevulinate synthase is required for apical transcellular barrier formation in the skin of the Drosophila larva,22293958,10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.11.005,"Animals construct a layered skin to prevent dehydration and pathogen entrance. The barrier function of the skin relies on the extensive cross-linking of specialised components. In insects, for instance, epidermal cells produce an apical extracellular cuticle that consists of a network of proteins, chitin and lipids. We have identified mutations in the Drosophila gene coding for the δ-aminolevulinate synthase (Alas) that cause massive water loss. The cuticle of alas mutant larvae detaches from the epidermis and its basal region is frayed suggesting that an Alas dependent pathway is needed to organise the contact between the cuticle and the epidermis and anchor the cuticle to the apical surface of epidermal cells. Concomitantly, reduction of Alas function results in weakening of the extracellular dityrosines network in the cuticle, whereas glutamyl-lysine isopeptide bonds are not affected. The lateral septate junctions of epidermal cells that serve as a paracellular plug are intact, as well. Taken together, we hypothesise that Alas activity, which initiates heme biosynthesis in the mitochondrion, is needed for the formation of a dityrosine-based barrier that confers resistance to the internal hydrostatic pressure protecting both the cuticle from transcellular infiltration of body fluid and the animal from dehydration. We conclude that at least two modules--an apical protein-chitin lattice and the lateral septate junctions, act in parallel to ensure Drosophila skin impermeability.",2012,"Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Frauke Meyer, Angel Vizoso Vázquez, Matthias Flötenmeyer, Maria Esperanza Cerdán, Bernard Moussian, Khaleelulla Saheb Shaik, Frauke Meyer, Angel Vizoso Vázquez, Matthias Flötenmeyer, Maria Esperanza Cerdán, Bernard Moussian"
Drosophila GAGA factor is required for full activation of the dE2f1-Yki/Sd transcriptional program,23070566,10.4161/cc.22486,"The Hippo signaling pathway regulates organ size by controlling the activity of the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki). Yki is recruited to its target genes by DNA-binding proteins such as Scalloped (Sd). In addition, transcription factor dE2f1, of the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway, cooperates with Yki/Sd to synergistically activate a set of common cell cycle target genes. However, little is known about other factors that ensure the proper transcriptional output of Hippo signaling. In this report we identified the chromatin protein GAGA factor (GAF), which is encoded by the Trithorax-like (Trl) gene, as a novel and critical partner in transcriptional regulation by Yki/Sd and dE2f1. We show that GAF is required for the full activation of target genes by dE2f1 and Yki/Sd; while ablation of GAF compromises both normal and inappropriate cell proliferation driven by Yki and dE2f1 in multiple tissues. The importance of GAF is further supported by strong genetic interactions between GAF and the Rb and Hippo pathways. Additionally, we show that GAF directly interacts with RBF, a Drosophila pRB homolog, and partially co-localizes with RBF on polytene chromosomes. Collectively, our data provide a novel connection between a chromatin-binding protein and a transcriptional program governed by the Hippo and Rb pathways.",2012,"Battuya Bayarmagnai, Brandon N Nicolay, Abul B M M K Islam, Nuria Lopez-Bigas, Maxim V Frolov, Battuya Bayarmagnai, Brandon N Nicolay, Abul B M M K Islam, Nuria Lopez-Bigas, Maxim V Frolov"
Evidence for elevated mutation rates in low-quality genotypes,22451943,10.1073/pnas.1118918109,"The deleterious mutation rate plays a key role in a number of important topics in biology, from mating system evolution to human health. Despite this broad significance, the nature and causes of variation in mutation rate are poorly understood, especially in multicellular organisms. We test whether genetic quality, the presence or absence of deleterious alleles, affects the mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster by using a modified mutation accumulation approach. We find evidence that genotypes constructed to carry deleterious ""treatment"" alleles on one chromosome during mutation accumulation experience an elevated mutation rate on a different chromosome. Further, this elevation is correlated with the effect of the treatment alleles on phenotypic condition, measured as body mass. Treatment alleles that reduce mass by 10% cause a doubling in the rate of mutational decline. Our results show that mutation rates are sensitive to genetic stress, such that individuals with low-quality genotypes will produce offspring of even lower genetic quality, in a mutational positive feedback loop. This type of variation in mutation rate is expected to alter a variety of predictions based on mutation load theory and accelerate adaptation to new environments. Positive mutational feedback could affect human health by increasing the rate of germline mutation, and possibly somatic mutation, in individuals of poor health because of genetic or environmental stress.",2012,"Nathaniel P Sharp, Aneil F Agrawal, Nathaniel P Sharp, Aneil F Agrawal"
Preparation of Drosophila tissue culture cells from different stages of the cell cycle for chromatin immunoprecipitation using centrifugal counterflow elutriation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting,22929773,10.1016/B978-0-12-391938-0.00011-2,"Many nuclear proteins alter their localization during the cell cycle. This includes proteins which regulate and execute cell cycle events and proteins involved in transcription and DNA repair. The core components of chromatin, the histone proteins, also change their modification state through the cell cycle. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) makes it possible to localize chromatin-associated proteins to specific sequences in the genome and has revolutionized studies of transcription. Fewer studies have used ChIP to analyze protein localization or modification at specific stages in the cell cycle. This is in part because these studies require isolation of pure populations of cells at each stage of the cell cycle, which is challenging for many cell types. However, the ability to carry out ChIP from cells at specific stages in the cell cycle in some systems has revealed cell cycle regulation of chromatin localization, and cell cycle stage-specific functions and modification of chromatin proteins, providing incentive to pursue these experiments. This chapter presents protocols for isolating Drosophila S2 cells from all phases of the cell cycle using centrifugal elutriation and fluorescent-activated cell sorting.

Assembly of Bazooka polarity landmarks through a multifaceted membrane-association mechanism,22303000,10.1242/jcs.091884,"Epithelial cell polarity is essential for animal development. The scaffold protein Bazooka (Baz/PAR-3) forms apical polarity landmarks to organize epithelial cells. However, it is unclear how Baz is recruited to the plasma membrane and how this is coupled with downstream effects. Baz contains an oligomerization domain, three PDZ domains, and binding regions for the protein kinase aPKC and phosphoinositide lipids. With a structure-function approach, we dissected the roles of these domains in the localization and function of Baz in the Drosophila embryonic ectoderm. We found that a multifaceted membrane association mechanism localizes Baz to the apical circumference. Although none of the Baz protein domains are essential for cortical localization, we determined that each contributes to cortical anchorage in a specific manner. We propose that the redundancies involved might provide plasticity and robustness to Baz polarity landmarks. We also identified specific downstream effects, including the promotion of epithelial structure, a positive-feedback loop that recruits aPKC, PAR-6 and Crumbs, and a negative-feedback loop that regulates Baz.",2012,"R F Andrew McKinley, Cao Guo Yu, Tony J C Harris, R F Andrew McKinley, Cao Guo Yu, Tony J C Harris"
No effect of Wolbachia on resistance to intracellular infection by pathogenic bacteria in Drosophila melanogaster,22808174,10.1371/journal.pone.0040500,"Multiple studies have shown that infection with the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis confers Drosophila melanogaster and other insects with resistance to infection by RNA viruses. Studies investigating whether Wolbachia infection induces the immune system or confers protection against secondary bacterial infection have not shown any effect. These studies, however, have emphasized resistance against extracellular pathogens. Since Wolbachia lives inside the host cell, we hypothesized that Wolbachia might confer resistance to pathogens that establish infection by invading host cells. We therefore tested whether Wolbachia-infected D. melanogaster are protected against infection by the intracellular pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium, as well as the extracellular pathogenic bacterium Providencia rettgeri. We evaluated the ability of flies infected with Wolbachia to suppress secondary infection by pathogenic bacteria relative to genetically matched controls that had been cured of Wolbachia by treatment with tetracycline. We found no evidence that Wolbachia alters host ability to suppress proliferation of any of the three pathogenic bacteria.

The regulation and packaging of synaptic vesicles as related to recruitment within glutamatergic synapses,22929013,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.08.037,"The reserve pool (RP) and readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles within presynaptic nerve terminals, at crayfish and larval Drosophila neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), were examined for physiological differentiation into distinctly separate functional groups. These NMJs are glutamatergic and produce graded excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). The packaging of glutamate was perturbed by blocking the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) with bafilomycin A1. Various frequencies of motor nerve stimulation, exposure time, and concentration of bafilomycin A1 were examined. The low-output tonic opener NMJs in crayfish exposed to 4 μM bafilomycin A1 and 20-Hz continuous stimulation decreased the EPSP amplitude to 50% in ∼30 min with controls lasting 3h. After activity and bafilomycin A1-induced synaptic depression, the EPSPs were rapidly revitalized by serotonin (5-HT, 1 μM) in the crayfish preparations. The 5-HT action can be blocked with a PLC inhibitor. We postulate 5-HT recruits unused vesicles from the RP. The perception is the RRP is selectively activated during rapid electrical stimulation (20 Hz) sparing the RP. When stimulation frequency is high (40 Hz) the RP is recruited to the RRP and dampens subsequent recruitment with 5-HT. The higher output synapses of the larval Drosophila NMJ when stimulated at 1 Hz or 5 Hz and exposed to 4 μM of bafilomycin A1 showed a depression rate of 50% within ∼10 min with controls lasting ∼40 min. After low frequency depression and/or exposure to bafilomycin A1 a burst of higher frequency (10 Hz) can recruit vesicles from the RP to the RRP.",2012,"W-H Wu, R L Cooper, W-H Wu, R L Cooper"

GABA transmission is impaired in mutant l-LNv, and sleep defects in dnlg4 mutant flies can be rescued by genetic manipulation of GABA transmission. Furthermore, dnlg4 mutant flies exhibit a severe reduction in GABAA receptor RDL clustering, and DNlg4 associates with RDLs in vivo.

The Drosophila melanogaster methuselah gene: a novel gene with ancient functions,23696853,10.1371/journal.pone.0063747,"The Drosophila melanogaster G protein-coupled receptor gene, methuselah (mth), has been described as a novel gene that is less than 10 million years old. Nevertheless, it shows a highly specific expression pattern in embryos, larvae, and adults, and has been implicated in larval development, stress resistance, and in the setting of adult lifespan, among others. Although mth belongs to a gene subfamily with 16 members in D. melanogaster, there is no evidence for functional redundancy in this subfamily. Therefore, it is surprising that a novel gene influences so many traits. Here, we explore the alternative hypothesis that mth is an old gene. Under this hypothesis, in species distantly related to D. melanogaster, there should be a gene with features similar to those of mth. By performing detailed phylogenetic, synteny, protein structure, and gene expression analyses we show that the D. virilis GJ12490 gene is the orthologous of mth in species distantly related to D. melanogaster. We also show that, in D. americana (a species of the virilis group of Drosophila), a common amino acid polymorphism at the GJ12490 orthologous gene is significantly associated with developmental time, size, and lifespan differences.

Dietary and genetic effects on age-related loss of gene silencing reveal epigenetic plasticity of chromatin repression during aging,24243774,10.18632/aging.100614,"During aging, changes in chromatin state that alter gene transcription have been postulated to result in expression of genes that are normally silenced, leading to deleterious age-related effects on cellular physiology.

We use a novel position effect variegation (PEV) reporter in Drosophila melanogaster to show that age-related loss of repressive heterochromatin is associated with loss of gene silencing in metazoans and is affected by Sir2, as it is in yeast. The life span-extending intervention, calorie restriction (CR), delays the age-related loss of gene silencing, indicating that loss of gene silencing is a component of normal aging.

The present study investigates the proteomic response (2D-DIGE) of adult Drosophila melanogaster acclimated at 11, 25 or 31 °C. As expected 11 °C-acclimation improved cold tolerance and 31 °C-acclimation improved heat tolerance. We hypothesized that the marked organismal responses to acclimation could be detected at the proteomic level assuming that changes in the abundance of specific proteins are linked to the physiological changes underlying the phenotypic response. The 31 °C-acclimated flies displayed a particular divergent proteomic profile where molecular chaperones made up a large number of the proteins that were modulated during heat acclimation. Many other proteins showed significant modulation during acclimation including proteins involved in iron ion and cell redox homeostasis, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, chromatin remodeling and translation, and contractile machinery. Interestingly the changes in protein abundance were often unrelated to transcriptional activity of the genes coding for the proteins, except for the most strongly expressed proteins (e.g. Hsp70). The 11 °C-acclimation evoked weak proteomic response despite the marked effect on the organismal phenotype. Thus the acquired cold tolerance observed here may involve regulatory process such as posttranslational regulation rather than de novo protein synthesis.",2013,"Hervé Colinet, Johannes Overgaard, Emmanuelle Com, Jesper Givskov Sørensen, Hervé Colinet, Johannes Overgaard, Emmanuelle Com, Jesper Givskov Sørensen"
Transcriptional basis of the acclimation to high environmental temperature at the olfactory receptor organs of Drosophila melanogaster,23590196,10.1186/1471-2164-14-259,"Background:
        
      
      Environmental temperature directly affects the concentrations of chemicals in the gas phase. Therefore, if the olfactory system does not physiologically adapt to environmental conditions, it may provide inadequate information about the distance to or direction of odor sources. Previous reports have shown at the behavioral level that temperature induces changes in olfactory sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. These changes are initiated in the main olfactory receptor organs, the antennae. In this work, we attempted to identify the particular genes responsible for olfactory adaptation to increasing temperatures in these organs based on current knowledge of the molecular basis of olfactory reception.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Whole-genome transcriptional responses to transitory temperature shifts from 21-30°C were analyzed in the third antennal segments of Drosophila. More than 53% of the genome was expressed in these organs; this percentage increased slightly (55%) after heat treatment. However, the expression levels increased for 26%, decreased for 21% and remained constant for 53% of the expressed genes. Analysis of the changes produced in 389 genes related to heat response and olfactory reception, according to the current functional annotations of the Drosophila gene set, showed significant differences in 95 of these genes, which are involved in the heat response (23), perireceptor events in olfaction (50), olfactory and gustatory receptors (18) and G-proteins and transduction cascades (4).
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Gene expression was altered in response to environmental heat in the antennae of Drosophila by increasing or decreasing expression. Different acclimation patterns emerged for reception through the basiconic, trichoid and coeloconic sensilla. Changes in genes with a central role in olfactory reception, such as orco, may account for part of the acclimation reported at the behavioral level.",2013,"Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta, Jacob Riveron, Tamara Boto, Esther Alcorta"
Patterning the dorsal-ventral axis of the wasp Nasonia vitripennis,23735637,10.1016/j.ydbio.2013.05.026,"Regulatory networks composed of interacting genes are responsible for pattern formation and cell type specification in a wide variety of developmental contexts. Evolution must act on these regulatory networks in order to change the proportions, distribution, and characteristics of specified cells. Thus, understanding how these networks operate in homologous systems across multiple levels of phylogenetic divergence is critical for understanding the evolution of developmental systems. Among the most thoroughly characterized regulatory networks is the dorsal-ventral patterning system of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Due to the thorough understanding of this system, it is an ideal starting point for comparative analyses. Here we report an analysis of the DV patterning system of the wasp, Nasonia vitripennis. This wasp undergoes a mode of long germ embryogenesis that is superficially nearly identical to that of Drosophila, but one that was likely independently derived. We have found that while the expression of genes just prior to the onset of gastrulation is almost identical in Nasonia and Drosophila, both the upstream network responsible for generating this pattern, and the downstream morphogenetic movements that it sets in motion, are significantly diverged.

Role for Krüppel-like transcription factor 11 in mesenchymal cell function and fibrosis,24069400,10.1371/journal.pone.0075311,"Krüppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) and the highly homologous KLF10 proteins are transcription factors originating from duplication of the Drosophila melanogaster ancestor cabut. The function of these proteins in epithelial cells has been previously characterized. In the current study, we report a functional role for KLF11 in mesenchymal cells and in mesenchymal cell dysfunction, namely, fibrosis, and subsequently perform a detailed cellular, molecular, and in vivo characterization of this phenomenon. We find that, in cultured mesenchymal cells, enhanced expression of KLF11 results in activated extracellular matrix pathways, including collagen gene silencing and matrix metalloproteinases activation without changes in tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases. Combined, reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that KLF11 interacts directly with the collagen 1a2 (COL1A2) promoter in mesenchymal cells to repress its activity. Mechanistically, KLF11 regulates collagen gene expression through the heterochromatin protein 1 gene-silencing pathway as mutants defective for coupling to this epigenetic modifier lose the ability to repress COL1A2. Expression studies reveal decreased levels of KLF11 during liver fibrogenesis after chemically induced injury in vivo. Congruently, KLF11(-/-) mice, which should be deficient in the hypothesized anti-fibrogenic brake imposed by this transcription factor, display an enhanced response to liver injury with increased collagen fibril deposition.

Many chromosomal inversions are under strong selection and their role in recombination reduction enhances the maintenance of their genetic distinctness. Here we analyze levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity, selection and demographic history, using 37 individuals of Drosophila subobscura from Mount Parnes (Greece) and Barcelona (Spain). Our sampling focused on two frequent O-chromosome arrangements that differ by two overlapping inversions (OST and O(3+4)), which are differentially adapted to the environment as observed by their opposing latitudinal clines in inversion frequencies. The six analyzed genes (Pif1A, Abi, Sqd, Yrt, Atpα and Fmr1) were selected for their location across the O-chromosome and their implication in thermal adaptation. Despite the extensive gene flux detected outside the inverted region, significant genetic differentiation between both arrangements was found inside it. However, high levels of gene flow were detected for all six genes when comparing the same arrangement among populations.

In a variety of tissues, Hh acts as a morphogen to regulate growth and cell fate specification.

Here, we analyse the mechanism underlying Hh movement in the wing disc and the abdominal epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that, in both epithelia, cells generate cytonemes in regions of Hh signalling. These protrusions are actin-based and span several cell diameters. Various Hh signalling components localize to cytonemes, as well as to punctate structures that move along cytonemes and are probably exovesicles. Using in vivo imaging, we show that cytonemes are dynamic structures and that Hh gradient establishment correlates with cytoneme formation in space and time. Indeed, mutant conditions that affect cytoneme formation reduce both cytoneme length and Hh gradient length.

Variation in male mate choice in Drosophila melanogaster,23405271,10.1371/journal.pone.0056299,"Male mate choice has been reported in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, even though males of this species were previously thought to maximise their fitness by mating with all available females. To understand the evolution of male mate choice it is important to understand variation in male mating preferences. Two studies, using different stock populations and different methods, have reported contrasting patterns of variation in male mate choice in D. melanogaster. Two possible explanations are that there are evolved differences in each stock population or that the methods used to measure choice could have biased the results. We investigated these hypotheses here by repeating the methods used in one study in which variable male mate choice was found, using the stock population from the other study in which choice was not variable. The results showed a significant resource-independent male preference for less fecund, smaller females, which contrasts with previous observations of male mate choice. This indicates that different selection pressures between populations have resulted in evolved differences in the expression of male mate choice. It also reveals phenotypic plasticity in male mate choice in response to cues encountered in each choice environment. The results highlight the importance of variation in male mate choice, and of identifying mechanisms in order to understand the evolution of mate choice under varying ecological conditions.",2013,"Dominic A Edward, Tracey Chapman, Dominic A Edward, Tracey Chapman"
RNA pathogenesis via Toll-like receptor-activated inflammation in expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases,24046729,10.3389/fnmol.2013.00025,"Previously, we hypothesized that an RNA-based pathogenic pathway has a causal role in the dominantly inherited unstable expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases. In support of this hypothesis we, and others, have characterized rCAG.rCUG 100 repeat double-strand RNA (dsRNA) as a previously unidentified agent capable of causing pathogenesis in a Drosophila model of neurodegenerative disease. Dicer, Toll, and autophagy pathways have distinct roles in this Drosophila dsRNA pathology. Dicer dependence is accompanied by cleavage of rCAG.rCUG 100 repeat dsRNA down to r(CAG) 7 21-mers. Among the ""molecular hallmarks"" of this pathway that have been identified in Drosophila, some [i.e., r(CAG) 7 and elevated tumor necrosis factor] correlate with observations in affected people (e.g., Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or in related animal models (i.e., autophagy). The Toll pathway is activated in the presence of repeat-containing dsRNA and toxicity is also dependent on this pathway. How might the endogenously expressed dsRNA mediate Toll-dependent toxicity in neuronal cells? Endogenous RNAs are normally shielded from Toll pathway activation as part of the mechanism to distinguish ""self"" from ""non-self"" RNAs. This typically involves post-transcriptional modification of the RNA. Therefore, it is likely that rCAG.rCUG 100 repeat dsRNA has a characteristic property that interferes with or evades this normal mechanism of shielding. We predict that repeat expansion leads to an alteration in RNA structure and/or form that perturbs RNA modification, causing the unshielded repeat RNA (in the form of its Dicer-cleaved products) to be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), with consequent activation of the Toll pathway leading to loss of cell function and then ultimately cell death. We hypothesize that the proximal cause of expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases is the TLR recognition (and resultant innate inflammatory response) of repeat RNA as ""non-self"" due to their paucity of ""self"" modification.",2013,"Robert I Richards, Saumya E Samaraweera, Clare L van Eyk, Louise V O'Keefe, Catherine M Suter, Robert I Richards, Saumya E Samaraweera, Clare L van Eyk, Louise V O'Keefe, Catherine M Suter"
Drosophila EHBP1 regulates Scabrous secretion during Notch-mediated lateral inhibition,23788431,10.1242/jcs.126292,"Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that plays a central role in numerous developmental and disease processes. The versatility of the Notch pathway relies on the activity of context-dependent regulators. These include rab11, sec15, arp3 and Drosophila EHBP1 (dEHBP1), which control Notch signaling and cell fate acquisition in asymmetrically dividing mechanosensory lineages by regulating the trafficking of the ligand Delta. Here, we show that dEHBP1 also controls the specification of R8 photoreceptors, as its loss results in the emergence of supernumerary R8 photoreceptors. Given the requirements for Notch signaling during lateral inhibition, we propose that dEHBP1 regulates distinct aspects of Notch signaling in different developmental contexts. We show that dEHBP1 regulates the exocytosis of Scabrous, a positive regulator of Notch signaling. In conclusion, dEHBP1 provides developmental versatility of intercellular signaling by regulating the trafficking of distinct Notch signaling components.",2013,"Nikolaos Giagtzoglou, Tongchao Li, Shinya Yamamoto, Hugo J Bellen, Nikolaos Giagtzoglou, Tongchao Li, Shinya Yamamoto, Hugo J Bellen"
Germ plasm anchoring is a dynamic state that requires persistent trafficking,24290763,10.1016/j.celrep.2013.10.045,"Localized cytoplasmic determinants packaged as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles direct embryonic patterning and cell fate specification in a wide range of organisms. Once established, the asymmetric distributions of such RNP particles must be maintained, often over considerable developmental time. A striking example is the Drosophila germ plasm, which contains RNP particles whose localization to the posterior of the egg during oogenesis results in their asymmetric inheritance and segregation of germline from somatic fates in the embryo. Although actin-based anchoring mechanisms have been implicated, high-resolution live imaging revealed persistent trafficking of germ plasm RNP particles at the posterior cortex of the Drosophila oocyte. This motility relies on cortical microtubules, is mediated by kinesin and dynein motors, and requires coordination between the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons. Finally, we show that RNP particle motility is required for long-term germ plasm retention. We propose that anchoring is a dynamic state that renders asymmetries robust to developmental time and environmental perturbations.",2013,"Kristina S Sinsimer, Jack J Lee, Stephan Y Thiberge, Elizabeth R Gavis, Kristina S Sinsimer, Jack J Lee, Stephan Y Thiberge, Elizabeth R Gavis"
Evolution of sex comb from the primitive bristle pattern in Drosophila is associated with modification in the developmental regulatory protein Dachshund,23197370,10.1002/dvg.22361,"Sex comb is a recently evolved male specific character confined to the Sophophoran group of Drosophila. Such innovations in phenotypes as Waddington proposed, are, outcome of ""canalization"" in developmental pathways that occur due to mutations creating ""choice points"" in genetic regulatory pathways. Our interest in the present study is to understand the shifts in genetic network, which has lead to the origin of sex comb from the basic bristle pattern that is seen in rest of the members of Drosophilidae. Here we have made a comparative analysis of expression of some of the key regulators of sex comb morphogenesis, between D. melanogaster and a group of selected species, which primitively lack sex comb. Sex combs reduced (Scr), dachshund (dac), and bric-a-brac (bab) gene expression were studied. We show that, primitive bristle pattern is marked by a strikingly down regulated expression of Sex combs reduced in the first tarsal segment of the prothoracic leg discs of male flies. Further a remarkable change with respect to Dachshund, an activator of sex combs reduced gene in the sex comb regulatory pathway, is seen. This is attributed to changes in DAC protein that might have taken place between the two groups of species. bric-a-brac does not reveal any significant expression modulation between the sex comb bearing and the primitive patterned species. Earlier works had shown that within the Sophophoran group, dynamic changes in SCR expression is responsible for the diversity seen in sex comb morphology, where as no such variation is witnessed with respect to DAC expression. Our findings have demonstrated that the scenario is different between the group primitively lacking sex comb and D. melanogaster wherein an obvious change in the protein has taken place. genesis 51:97-109, 2013, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013,"Thangjam Ranjita Devi, C Amruthavalli, B V Shyamala, Thangjam Ranjita Devi, C Amruthavalli, B V Shyamala"

We show that autophagy is required for the most efficient degradation of glycogen in response to starvation.

Object tracking in motion-blind flies,23624513,10.1038/nn.3386,"Different visual features of an object, such as its position and direction of motion, are important elements for animal orientation, but the neural circuits extracting them are generally not well understood. We analyzed this problem in Drosophila, focusing on two well-studied behaviors known as optomotor response and fixation response. In the neural circuit controlling the optomotor response, columnar T4 and T5 cells are thought to be crucial. We found that blocking T4 and T5 cells resulted in a complete loss of the optomotor response. Nevertheless, these flies were still able to fixate a black bar, although at a reduced performance level. Further analysis revealed that flies in which T4 and T5 cells were blocked possess an intact position circuit that is implemented in parallel to the motion circuit; the optomotor response is exclusively controlled by the motion circuit, whereas the fixation response is supported by both the position and the motion circuit.",2013,"Armin Bahl, Georg Ammer, Tabea Schilling, Alexander Borst, Armin Bahl, Georg Ammer, Tabea Schilling, Alexander Borst"
"Pleiotropic constraints, expression level, and the evolution of miRNA sequences",24100521,10.1007/s00239-013-9588-6,"Post-transcriptional gene regulation mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) plays critical roles during development by modulating gene expression and conferring robustness to stochastic errors. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that miRNA acquisition could play a role in phenotypic innovation. Moreover, miRNA-induced regulation strongly impacts genome evolution, increasing selective constraints on 3'UTRs, protein sequences, and expression level divergence. Thus, it is essential to understand the factors governing sequence evolution for this important class of regulatory molecules. Investigation of the patterns of molecular evolution at miRNA loci have been limited in Caenorhabditis elegans because of the lack of a close outgroup. Instead, I used Caenorhabditis briggsae as the focus point of this study because of its close relationship to Caenorhabditis sp. 9. I also corroborated the patterns of sequence evolution in Caenorhabditis using published orthologous relationships among miRNAs in Drosophila. In nematodes and in flies, miRNA sequence divergence is not influenced by the genomic neighborhood (i.e., intronic or intergenic) but is nevertheless affected by the genomic context because X-linked miRNAs evolve faster than autosomal miRNAs. However, this effect of chromosomal linkage can be explained by differential expression levels rather than a fast-X effect. The results presented here support a universal negative relationship between rates of molecular evolution and expression level, and suggest that mutations in highly expressed miRNAs are more likely to be deleterious because they potentially affect a larger number of target genes. Finally, I show that many single family member miRNAs evolve faster than miRNAs from multigene families and have limited functional scope, suggesting that they are not strongly integrated in gene regulatory networks.",2013,"Richard Jovelin, Richard Jovelin"

The construct UAS-RNAi-dlg inactivates 14 transcripts--RE, RH, RQ, RS, RG, RD, RL, RB, RK, RR, RT, RN, RA, RP--and does not silenced the other 7 (RO, RF, RI, RU, RJ, RC, RM). This permits to study functions of proteins containg guanilate-kinase domain IPR008145 at C-end of the protein.

A HAT for sleep?: epigenetic regulation of sleep by Tip60 in Drosophila,23572111,10.4161/fly.24141,"Sleep disturbances are common in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Unfortunately, how AD is mechanistically linked with interference of the body's natural sleep rhythms remains unclear. Our recent findings provide insight into this question by demonstrating that sleep disruption associated with AD is driven by epigenetic changes mediated by the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Tip60. In this study, we show that Tip60 functionally interacts with the AD associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) to regulate axonal growth of Drosophila small ventrolateral neuronal (sLNv) pacemaker cells, and their production of neuropeptide pigment dispersing factor (PDF) that stabilizes appropriate sleep-wake patterns in the fly. Loss of Tip60 HAT activity under APP neurodegenerative conditions causes decreased PDF production, retraction of the sLNv synaptic arbor required for PDF release and disruption of sleep-wake cycles in these flies. Remarkably, excess Tip60 in conjunction with APP fully rescues these sleep-wake disturbances by inducing overelaboration of the sLNv synaptic terminals and increasing PDF levels, supporting a neuroprotective role for Tip60 in these processes. Our studies highlight the importance of epigenetic based mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances in neurodegenerative diseases like AD.",2013,"Sheila K Pirooznia, Felice Elefant, Sheila K Pirooznia, Felice Elefant"

Fruitless isoforms and target genes specify the sexually dimorphic nervous system underlying Drosophila reproductive behavior,25483248,10.4161/fly.29132,"Courtship is pivotal to successful reproduction throughout the animal kingdom. Sexual differences in the nervous system are thought to underlie courtship behavior.

Although a large number of previous studies have demonstrated that fru plays essential roles in male courtship behavior, we know little about the function of Fru isoforms at the molecular level. Our recent study revealed that male-specific Fru isoforms are expressed in highly overlapping subsets of neurons in the male brain and ventral nerve cord. Fru isoforms play both distinct and redundant roles in male courtship behavior. Importantly, we have identified for the first time, by means of the DamID technique, direct Fru transcriptional target genes.

For example, researchers have used this model in studies investigating interactions between the microbiota and the immune system at barrier epithelial surfaces that ensure proper nutritional and immune homeostasis both locally and systemically. In addition, studies in D. melanogaster have been pivotal in uncovering how the immune response is regulated by both endocrine and metabolic signalling systems, and how the immune response modifies these systems as part of a homeostatic circuit.

Role of SCOX in determination of Drosophila melanogaster lifespan,25057436,,"In man, COX (cytochrome c oxidase) deficiency is reported to be related to mutation of the SCO2 (synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2) gene, which encodes one of the copper-donor chaperones involved in the assembly of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. Such COX deficiency due to the genetic condition leads to heart disease and the Leigh syndrome and is frequently fatal in childhood. Synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase X (SCOX) is a Drosophila orthologue of human SCO2. Here, we generated SCOX-knockdown flies and the full length SCOX transgenic flies to investigate the in vivo roles of SCOX. Our results demonstrated knockdown of SCOX gene in all cells and tissues to be associated with lethality at larval or pupal stages and this correlated with a decrease in ATP level. In contrast, the full length SCOX transgenic flies showed a longer lifespan than wild type flies and control flies carrying Act5C-GAL4 alone and this correlated with an increase in ATP level. Finally, when cultured on paraquat-added medium, full length SCOX transgenic flies also exhibited an elongated lifespan.

[Role of DNA repair genes in radiation-induced changes of lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster],25775840,,"One of the main effects of various stress factors, including ionizing radiation, is DNA damage. Accumulation of DNA damage and somatic mutations in the somatic tissues is regarded as one of the basic mechanisms of aging. We have developed an approach to the study of molecular and genetic mechanisms of radioadaptation, which is based on the analysis of changes in the lifespan of Drosophila with a transformed genotype. In this study we investigated the radioadaptive response and hormesis by radiation-induced changed of the lifespan of different strains of Drosophila melanogaster, such as a wild type strain Canton-Sand strains with mutations in DNA damage response gene (homologue of GADD45), excision repair genes (homologues of XPF, XPC, PCNA) and double-strand breaks repair genes (homologues of RAD54, XRCC3, BLM). The exposure to irradiation at the dose rate of 40 cGy was performed chronically through the stages of fly development; an acute exposure at the dose rate of 30 Gy was applied to the adult stages of flies. Also, we investigated the resistance to acute gamma-radiation of Drosophila with conditional ubiquitous overexpression of genes that are involved in DNA damage recognition (homologues of GADD45, HUS1, CHK2), excision repair (homologues of XPF, XPC, AP-endonuclease-1) and double-strand break repair (homologues of BRCA2, XRCC3, KU80, WRNexo). In the wild type strain Canton-S, manifestation of the radioadaptive response and radiation hormesis were observed. In individuals with DNA repair gene mutations, no radioadaptive response was observed, or observed to a lesser extent than in wild type flies. Mifepristone--inducible transgene activation does not lead to an increase in resistance to acute irradiation by the parameters of lifespan of Drosophila.

In principal, we generated Knickkopf versions with exchanged residues tryptophan(299), methionine(333), arginine(401), or histidine(437), and scored for the ability of the respective engineered protein to normalize the knickkopf mutant phenotype. Our results confirm the absolute necessity of tryptophan(299), methionine(333), and histidine(437) for Knickkopf function and stability, the latter two being predicted to be critical for heme binding. In contrast, arginine(401) is required for full efficiency of Knickkopf activity. Taken together, our genetic data support the prediction of these residues to mediate the function of Knickkopf during cuticle differentiation in insects.

Sonication-facilitated immunofluorescence staining of late-stage embryonic and larval Drosophila tissues in situ,25146311,10.3791/51528,"Studies performed in Drosophila melanogaster embryos and larvae provide crucial insight into developmental processes such as cell fate specification and organogenesis. Immunostaining allows for the visualization of developing tissues and organs. However, a protective cuticle that forms at the end of embryogenesis prevents permeation of antibodies into late-stage embryos and larvae. While dissection prior to immunostaining is regularly used to analyze Drosophila larval tissues, it proves inefficient for some analyses because small tissues may be difficult to locate and isolate. Sonication provides an alternative to dissection in larval Drosophila immunostaining protocols. It allows for quick, simultaneous processing of large numbers of late-stage embryos and larvae and maintains in situ morphology. After fixation in formaldehyde, a sample is sonicated. Sample is then subjected to immunostaining with antigen-specific primary antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies to visualize target cell types and specific proteins via fluorescence microscopy. During the process of sonication, proper placement of a sonicating probe above the sample, as well as the duration and intensity of sonication, is critical. Additonal minor modifications to standard immunostaining protocols may be required for high quality stains. For antibodies with low signal to noise ratio, longer incubation times are typically necessary. As a proof of concept for this sonication-facilitated protocol, we show immunostains of three tissue types (testes, ovaries, and neural tissues) at a range of developmental stages.",2014,"Ashley Fidler, Lauren Boulay, Matthew Wawersik, Ashley Fidler, Lauren Boulay, Matthew Wawersik"

We show that ND2 mutants exhibit phenotypes that resemble symptoms of mitochondrial disease, including shortened lifespan, progressive neurodegeneration, diminished neural mitochondrial membrane potential and lower levels of neural ATP. Our biochemical studies of ND2 mutants reveal that complex I is unable to efficiently couple electron transfer to proton pumping. Thus, our study provides evidence that the ND2 subunit participates directly in the proton pumping mechanism of complex I.

A functional screen reveals an extensive layer of transcriptional and splicing control underlying RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila,24643257,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001809,"The small GTPase RAS is among the most prevalent oncogenes. The evolutionarily conserved RAF-MEK-MAPK module that lies downstream of RAS is one of the main conduits through which RAS transmits proliferative signals in normal and cancer cells. Genetic and biochemical studies conducted over the last two decades uncovered a small set of factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling. Interestingly, most of these were found to control RAF activation, thus suggesting a central regulatory role for this event. Whether additional factors are required at this level or further downstream remains an open question. To obtain a comprehensive view of the elements functionally linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade, we used a quantitative assay in Drosophila S2 cells to conduct a genome-wide RNAi screen for factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated to this pathway. Epistasis experiments were then carried out on individual candidates to determine their position relative to core pathway components. While this revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway--including a new protein complex modulating RAF activation--we found that most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and thereby suggest that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. We further characterized two representative members of this group and surprisingly found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila. In addition, it suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels.

Small open reading frames pack a big punch in cardiac calcium regulation,24385504,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.113.302716,"Cardiac contraction requires continuous cycles of calcium release and reuptake between the sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum. In vertebrate cardiomyocytes, re-sequestration of calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum is accomplished by the SERCA whose activity is dampened by interaction with the small integral membrane proteins, phospholamban and sarcolipin. In a recent report published in Science, Magny et al identify 2 small peptides in Drosophila encoded in a putative long noncoding RNA that buffers calcium reuptake by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a in a similar manner to sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a regulation by phospholamban and sarcolipin. These findings demonstrate that regulation of Ca2+-ATPases by small transmembrane peptides is a conserved and ancient strategy. Furthermore, this study highlights the possibility that there may be many undiscovered small peptides encoded within putative long non-coding RNAs that regulate important biological pathways.",2014,"Benjamin R Nelson, Douglas M Anderson, Eric N Olson, Benjamin R Nelson, Douglas M Anderson, Eric N Olson"

We characterized the effects of natural variation on the penetrance of hybrid inviability phenotypes in crosses between Drosophila melanogaster and two species of the D. simulans subcomplex, D. simulans and D. sechellia. Using a panel of wild-caught lines, we studied the levels of genetic variance present in D. simulans and D. sechellia affecting prezygotic and post-zygotic isolation in hybridizations with D. melanogaster females. We observed extensive variability in the viability of hybrid individuals, dependent on the genotype of the parents, suggesting that intraspecific natural variation manifests directly in hybrid phenotypes. Furthermore, we found that genetic background significantly affects the penetrance of a well-studied determinant of hybrid inviability: the interaction between Hmrmel-Lhrsim. Our results suggest that hybrid inviability--and reproductive isolation generally--can be modified by polymorphisms at multiple loci segregating within the parental species. Just as the penetrance of most mutant phenotypes can be modified by the genetic background within the pure species, the penetrance of hybrid inviability phenotypes is highly influenced by the parental genotypes.",2014,"D R Matute, J Gavin-Smyth, G Liu, D R Matute, J Gavin-Smyth, G Liu"
Transcriptional responses in a Drosophila defensive symbiosis,24274471,10.1111/mec.12603,"Inherited symbionts are ubiquitous in insects and can have important consequences for the fitness of their hosts. Many inherited symbionts defend their hosts against parasites or other natural enemies; however, the means by which most symbionts confer protection is virtually unknown. We examine the mechanisms of defence in a recently discovered case of symbiont-mediated protection, where the bacterial symbiont Spiroplasma defends the fly Drosophila neotestacea from a virulent nematode parasite, Howardula aoronymphium. Using quantitative PCR of Spiroplasma infection intensities and whole transcriptome sequencing, we attempt to distinguish between the following modes of defence: symbiont-parasite competition, host immune priming and the production of toxic factors by Spiroplasma. Our findings do not support a model of exploitative competition between Howardula and Spiroplasma to mediate defence, nor do we find strong support for host immune priming during Spiroplasma infection. Interestingly, we recovered sequence for putative toxins encoded by Spiroplasma, including a novel putative ribosome-inactivating protein, transcripts of which are up-regulated in response to nematode exposure.

Inactivation of these cells results in indiscriminate and excessive intake of all compounds, independent of taste quality or nutritional state. Conversely, acute activation of these neurons suppresses consumption of water and nutrients. The output from these neurons is required to gate activity in motor neurons that control meal initiation and consumption.

FAK suppressed RTKs signalling in Drosophila melanogaster epithelia by impairing MAPK pathway. This regulation was also observed in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, suggesting it is a conserved phenomenon in humans. Mechanistically, FAK reduced receptor recycling into the plasma membrane, which resulted in lower MAPK activation. Conversely, increasing the membrane pool of the receptor increased MAPK pathway signalling.

Comparison of inter- and intraspecies variation in humans and fruit flies,26484147,10.1016/j.gdata.2014.11.010,"Variation is essential to species survival and adaptation during evolution. This variation is conferred by the imperfection of biochemical processes, such as mutations and alterations in DNA sequences, and can also be seen within genomes through processes such as the generation of antibodies. Recent sequencing projects have produced multiple versions of the genomes of humans and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). These give us a chance to study how individual gene sequences vary within and between species. Here we arranged human and fly genes in orthologous pairs and compared such within-species variability with their degree of conservation between flies and humans. We observed that a significant number of proteins associated with mRNA translation are highly conserved between species and yet are highly variable within each species. The fact that we observe this in two species whose lineages separated more than 700 million years ago suggests that this is the result of a very ancient process. We hypothesize that this effect might be attributed to a positive selection for variability of virus-interacting proteins that confers a general resistance to viral hijacking of the mRNA translation machinery within populations.

Surprisingly, the resulting flies were viable and produced normally patterned appendages of nearly the right size, albeit with a delay. We show that, in the prospective wing, prolonged wingless transcription followed by memory of earlier signalling allows persistent expression of relevant target genes. We suggest therefore that the spread of Wingless is dispensable for patterning and growth even though it probably contributes to increasing cell proliferation.",2014,"Cyrille Alexandre, Alberto Baena-Lopez, Jean-Paul Vincent, Cyrille Alexandre, Alberto Baena-Lopez, Jean-Paul Vincent"

The polarization-in polarization-out SHG measurements of headless myosin mutants of indirect flight muscle in Drosophila melanogaster confirmed a lower susceptibility component ratio compared to the head-containing myocytes with wild-type myosins. The increase in the ratio is assigned to the change in the deflection angle of the myosin S2 domain and possible contribution of myosin heads. The nonlinear susceptibility component ratio is a sensitive indicator of the myosin structure, and therefore, it can be used for conformational studies of myosin nanomotors.

"The influence of dynein processivity control, MAPs, and microtubule ends on directional movement of a localising mRNA",24737859,10.7554/eLife.01596,"Many cellular constituents travel along microtubules in association with multiple copies of motor proteins. How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising Drosophila mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin's activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.

      Regulation of cell size requires coordination of growth and proliferation. Conditional loss of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in mice permits hepatocyte growth without cell division, allowing us to study cell size in vivo using transcriptomics and metabolomics.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Larger cells displayed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes but unexpectedly repressed expression of many genes involved in mitochondrial functions. This effect appears to be cell autonomous because cultured Drosophila cells induced to increase cell size displayed a similar gene-expression pattern. Larger hepatocytes also displayed a reduction in the expression of lipogenic transcription factors, especially sterol-regulatory element binding proteins. Inhibition of mitochondrial functions and lipid biosynthesis, which is dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, increased the cell size with reciprocal effects on cell proliferation in several cell lines.

      We uncover that large cell-size increase is accompanied by downregulation of mitochondrial gene expression, similar to that observed in diabetic individuals.

Missense mutations in RAB7A, the gene encoding the small GTPase Rab7, cause CMT2B and increase Rab7 activity. Rab7 is ubiquitously expressed and is involved in degradation through the lysosomal pathway. In the neurons, Rab7 plays a role in the long-range retrograde transport of signalling endosomes in the axons.

Furthermore, the larvae exhibit a crawling defect when the mutant protein is expressed in the motor neurons.

Drosophila embryogenesis scales uniformly across temperature in developmentally diverse species,24762628,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004293,"Temperature affects both the timing and outcome of animal development, but the detailed effects of temperature on the progress of early development have been poorly characterized. To determine the impact of temperature on the order and timing of events during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging to track the progress of embryos from shortly after egg laying through hatching at seven precisely maintained temperatures between 17.5 °C and 32.5 °C. We employed a combination of automated and manual annotation to determine when 36 milestones occurred in each embryo. D. melanogaster embryogenesis takes [Formula: see text]33 hours at 17.5 °C, and accelerates with increasing temperature to a low of 16 hours at 27.5 °C, above which embryogenesis slows slightly. Remarkably, while the total time of embryogenesis varies over two fold, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across temperatures. To further explore the relationship between temperature and embryogenesis, we expanded our analysis to cover ten additional Drosophila species of varying climatic origins. Six of these species, like D. melanogaster, are of tropical origin, and embryogenesis time at different temperatures was similar for them all. D. mojavensis, a sub-tropical fly, develops slower than the tropical species at lower temperatures, while D. virilis, a temperate fly, exhibits slower development at all temperatures. The alpine sister species D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura develop as rapidly as tropical flies at cooler temperatures, but exhibit diminished acceleration above 22.5 °C and have drastically slowed development by 30 °C. Despite ranging from 13 hours for D. erecta at 30 °C to 46 hours for D. virilis at 17.5 °C, the relative timing of events from cellularization through hatching is constant across all species and temperatures examined here, suggesting the existence of a previously unrecognized timer controlling the progress of embryogenesis that has been tuned by natural selection as each species diverges.",2014,"Steven G Kuntz, Michael B Eisen, Steven G Kuntz, Michael B Eisen"
E93 predominantly transduces 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling to induce autophagy and caspase activity in Drosophila fat body,24316411,10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.11.005,"During the larval-prepupal transition in Drosophila, a balancing crosstalk occurs between autophagy and caspase activity in the remodeling fat body: the inhibition of autophagy induces caspase activity and the inhibition of caspases induces autophagy. Both autophagy and caspase activity are induced by a pulse of molting hormone (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E) via the 20E nuclear receptor complex, EcR-USP. We here demonstrate that E93, a 20E primary-response gene encoding an HTH transcription factor, predominantly transduces 20E signaling to induce autophagy and caspase activity in the remodeling fat body. RNAi knockdown or mutation of E93 blocks autophagy and caspase activity, E93 overexpression induces them both, while E93 overexpression has a better rescuing effect on the inhibition of autophagy than caspase activity caused by EcR(DN) overexpression. At the transcriptional level, E93 not only greatly impacts the 20E-triggered transcriptional cascade, but also upregulates essential autophagy and apoptosis genes. Meanwhile, at the phosphorylational level, E93 blocks the PI3K-TORC1 signaling to initiate autophagy.

Multiple polymer architectures of human polyhomeotic homolog 3 sterile alpha motif,25044168,10.1002/prot.24645,"The self-association of sterile alpha motifs (SAMs) into a helical polymer architecture is a critical functional component of many different and diverse array of proteins.

Ph SAM shares 64% sequence identity with its human ortholog, PHC3 SAM, and both SAMs polymerize. However, in the context of their larger protein regions, PHC3 SAM forms longer polymers compared with Ph SAM. Motivated to establish the precise structural basis for the differences, if any, between Ph and PHC3 SAM, we determined the crystal structure of the PHC3 SAM polymer. PHC3 SAM uses the same SAM-SAM interaction as the Ph SAM sixfold repeat polymer. Yet, PHC3 SAM polymerizes using just five SAMs per turn of the helical polymer rather than the typical six per turn observed for all SAM polymers reported to date. Structural analysis suggested that malleability of the PHC3 SAM would allow formation of not just the fivefold repeat structure but also possibly others. Indeed, a second PHC3 SAM polymer in a different crystal form forms a sixfold repeat polymer. These results suggest that the polymers formed by PHC3 SAM, and likely others, are dynamic.

Coordinate regulation of stem cell competition by Slit-Robo and JAK-STAT signaling in the Drosophila testis,25375180,10.1371/journal.pgen.1004713,"Stem cells in tissues reside in and receive signals from local microenvironments called niches. Understanding how multiple signals within niches integrate to control stem cell function is challenging. The Drosophila testis stem cell niche consists of somatic hub cells that maintain both germline stem cells and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Here, we show a role for the axon guidance pathway Slit-Roundabout (Robo) in the testis niche. The ligand Slit is expressed specifically in hub cells while its receptor, Roundabout 2 (Robo2), is required in CySCs in order for them to compete for occupancy in the niche. CySCs also require the Slit-Robo effector Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) to prevent over-adhesion of CySCs to the niche, and CySCs mutant for Abl outcompete wild type CySCs for niche occupancy. Both Robo2 and Abl phenotypes can be rescued through modulation of adherens junction components, suggesting that the two work together to balance CySC adhesion levels. Interestingly, expression of Robo2 requires JAK-STAT signaling, an important maintenance pathway for both germline and cyst stem cells in the testis.

This virus is also associated with several cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As all herpesvirus family members, EBV initially replicates lytically to produce abundant virus particles, then enters a latent state to remain within the host indefinitely.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Through a genetic screen in Drosophila, we determined that reduction of Drosophila Tor activity altered EBV immediate-early protein function. To further investigate this finding, we inhibited mTOR in EBV-positive cells and investigated subsequent changes to lytic replication via Western blotting, flow cytometry, and quantitative PCR. The student T-test was used to evaluate significance.
    


          Results:
        
      
      mTOR, the human homolog of Drosophila Tor, is an important protein at the center of a major signaling pathway that controls many aspects of cell biology. As the EBV immediate-early genes are responsible for EBV lytic replication, we examined the effect of inhibition of mTORC1 on EBV lytic replication in human EBV-positive cell lines. We determined that treatment of cells with rapamycin, which is an inhibitor of mTORC1 activity, led to a reduction in the ability of B cell lines to undergo lytic replication. In contrast, EBV-positive epithelial cell lines underwent higher levels of lytic replication when treated with rapamycin.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Overall, the responses of EBV-positive cell lines vary when treated with mTOR inhibitors, and this may be important when considering such inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutic agents.",2014,"Amy L Adamson, Brandi T Le, Brian D Siedenburg, Amy L Adamson, Brandi T Le, Brian D Siedenburg"
A mechanism for intracellular release of Na+ by neurotransmitter/sodium symporters,25282149,10.1038/nsmb.2894,"Neurotransmitter/sodium symporters (NSSs) terminate synaptic signal transmission by Na+-dependent reuptake of released neurotransmitters. Key conformational states have been reported for the bacterial homolog LeuT and an inhibitor-bound Drosophila dopamine transporter. However, a coherent mechanism of Na+-driven transport has not been described. Here, we present two crystal structures of MhsT, an NSS member from Bacillus halodurans, in occluded inward-facing states with bound Na+ ions and L-tryptophan, providing insight into the cytoplasmic release of Na+. The switch from outward- to inward-oriented states is centered on the partial unwinding of transmembrane helix 5, facilitated by a conserved GlyX9Pro motif that opens an intracellular pathway for water to access the Na2 site. We propose a mechanism, based on our structural and functional findings, in which solvation through the TM5 pathway facilitates Na+ release from Na2 and the transition to an inward-open state.",2014,"Lina Malinauskaite, Matthias Quick, Linda Reinhard, Joseph A Lyons, Hideaki Yano, Jonathan A Javitch, Poul Nissen, Lina Malinauskaite, Matthias Quick, Linda Reinhard, Joseph A Lyons, Hideaki Yano, Jonathan A Javitch, Poul Nissen"
Sperm displacement in the Drosophila bipectinata species complex: evidence for interspecific variations,25556898,10.1016/j.beproc.2014.12.009,"We studied sperm displacement in two members of the Drosophila bipectinata species complex i.e., Drosophila parabipectinata and Drosophila malerkotliana by employing mutant and wild type strains. We found a significant increase in the productivity of remated females than that of once mated ones in all the crosses of the two species. The P2' values range from 0.67 to 0.70 in D. malerkotliana and 0.52 to 0.56 in D. parabipectinata. These results were compared with that of our earlier finding in D. bipectinata belonging to the same complex. We found that though the three species exhibit differences in the degree of sperm displacement, the pattern is somewhat similar in the three species. However, as far as its genetic variability and population size maintenance is considered, D. malerkotliana and D. bipectinata (P2' is 0.60-0.67) are at the forefront. Our finding is also supported by the fact that D. parabipectinata is derived from D. bipectinata and has not diverged much since its emergence as a separate species. The differences in the pattern of sperm displacement may be attributed to differences in remating latency, duration of copulation in first mating and sperm usage pattern among the members of this complex.",2015,"Akanksha Singh, Bashisth N Singh, Akanksha Singh, Bashisth N Singh"
Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in Drosophila,25755098,10.1002/wdev.178,"During animal development groups of cells with similar fates and functions often stay together and separate from cells with different fates. An example for this cellular behavior is the formation of compartments, groups of cells with similar fates that are separated by sharp boundaries from neighboring groups of cells. Compartments play important roles during patterning by serving as units of growth and gene expression. Boundaries between compartments are associated with organizers that secrete signaling molecules instructing growth and differentiation throughout the tissue. The straight shape of the boundary between compartments is important for maintaining the position and shape of the organizer and thus for precise patterning. The straight shape of compartment boundaries, however, is challenged by cell divisions and cell intercalations that take place in many developing tissues. Early work established a role for selector genes and signaling pathways in setting up and keeping boundaries straight. Recent work in Drosophila has now begun to further unravel the physical and cellular mechanisms that maintain compartment boundaries. Key to the separation of compartments is a local increase of actomyosin-dependent mechanical tension at cell junctions along the boundary. Increased mechanical tension acts as a barrier to cell mixing during cell division and influences cell rearrangements during cell intercalations along the compartment boundary in a way that the straight shape of the boundary is maintained. An important question for the future is how the signaling pathways that maintain the straight shape of compartment boundaries control mechanical tension along these boundaries.",2015,"Daiki Umetsu, Christian Dahmann, Daiki Umetsu, Christian Dahmann"

Paramutation phenomena in non-vertebrate animals,26318740,10.1016/j.semcdb.2015.08.009,"Paramutation was initially described in maize and was defined as an epigenetic interaction between two alleles of a locus, through which one allele induces a heritable modification of the other allele without modifying the DNA sequence [1,2]. Thus it implies that the paramutated allele conserves its new properties on the long term over generations even in the absence of the paramutagenic allele and that it turns paramutagenic itself, without undergoing any changes in the DNA sequence. Some epigenetic interactions have been described in two non-vertebrate animal models, which appear to exhibit similar properties. Both systems are linked to trans-generational transmission of non-coding small RNAs. In Drosophila melanogaster, paramutation is correlated with transmission of PIWI-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs that repress mobile DNA in the germline. A tandem repeated transgenic locus producing abundant ovarian piRNAs can activate piRNA production and associated homology-dependent silencing at a locus that was previously stably devoid of such capacities. The newly converted locus is then perfectly stable in absence of the inducer locus (>100 generations) and becomes fully paramutagenic. In Caenorhabditis elegans, paramutation is correlated with transmission of siRNAs, which are produced by transgenes targeted by piRNAs in the germline. Indeed, a transgenic locus, targeted by the piRNA machinery, produces siRNAs that can induce silencing of homologous transgenes, which can be further transmitted in a repressed state over generations despite the absence of the inducer transgenic locus. As in fly, the paramutated locus can become fully paramutagenic, and paramutation can be mediated by cytoplasmic inheritance without transmission of the paramutagenic locus itself. Nevertheless, in contrast to flies where the induction is only maternally inherited, both parents can transmit it in worms. In addition, a reciprocal phenomenon - (from off toward on) - appears to be also possible in worms as some activated transgenes can reactivate silent transgenes in the germline, and this modification can also be transmitted to next generations, even so it appears to be only partially stable. Thus, in a given system, opposite paramutation-like phenomena could exist, mediated by antagonist active pathways. As in plants, paramutation in flies and worms correlates with chromatin structure modification of the paramutated locus. In flies, inheritance of small RNAs from one generation to the next transmits a memory mainly targeting loci for repression whereas in worms, small RNAs can target loci either for repression or expression. Nevertheless, in the two species, paramutation can play an important role in the epigenome establishment.",2015,"Stéphane Ronsseray, Stéphane Ronsseray"
Variation in Drosophila melanogaster central metabolic genes appears driven by natural selection both within and between populations,25520361,10.1098/rspb.2014.2688,"In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the drivers of latitudinal selection observed in the eastern US Drosophila melanogaster populations are reiterated within seasons in a temperate orchard population in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we ask whether alleles that are apparently favoured in northern populations are also favoured early in the spring, and decrease in frequency from the spring to autumn with the population expansion. We use SNP data collected for 46 metabolic genes and 128 SNPs representing the central metabolic pathway and examine for the aggregate SNP allele frequencies whether the association of allele change with latitude and that with increasing days of spring-autumn season are reversed. Testing by random permutation, we observe a highly significant negative correlation between these associations that is consistent with this expectation. This correlation is stronger when we confine our analysis to only those alleles that show significant latitudinal changes. This pattern is not caused by association with chromosomal inversions. When data are resampled using SNPs for amino acid change the relationship is not significant but is supported when SNPs associated with cis-expression are only considered. Our results suggest that climate factors driving latitudinal molecular variation in a metabolic pathway are related to those operating on a seasonal level within populations.",2015,"Rodrigo Cogni, Kate Kuczynski, Erik Lavington, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes, Rodrigo Cogni, Kate Kuczynski, Erik Lavington, Spencer Koury, Emily L Behrman, Katherine R O'Brien, Paul S Schmidt, Walter F Eanes"
Dscam2 affects visual perception in Drosophila melanogaster,26106310,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00149,"Dscam2, a cell surface protein that mediates cellular repulsion, plays a crucial role in the development of the Drosophila melanogaster visual system. Dscam2 generates boundaries between neighboring modules in the fly optic lobe; in Dscam2 mutants this visual system modularity is compromised. Although developmental wiring defects have been well described in the Dscam2 mutant, behavioral consequences have not been investigated. To address this, we examined the visual behavior of Dscam2 mutant flies. Using a phototaxis assay, we ascertained that these flies are not blind, but have a reduced phototaxic response. Through population-based and single fly optomotor assays, we found that Dscam2 mutant flies can track motion but that their response is opposite to control flies under defined experimental conditions. In a fixation paradigm, which allows tethered flies to control the angular position of a visual stimulus, mutant flies' responses were diametrically opposed to those seen in control flies. These data suggest that modest changes in the modularity of the fly visual system in the Dscam2 mutant can dramatically change the perception of specific visual cues and modify behavior.",2015,"Danny S Bosch, Bruno van Swinderen, S Sean Millard, Danny S Bosch, Bruno van Swinderen, S Sean Millard"
Multipotent versus differentiated cell fate selection in the developing Drosophila airways,26633813,10.7554/eLife.09646,"Developmental potentials of cells are tightly controlled at multiple levels. The embryonic Drosophila airway tree is roughly subdivided into two types of cells with distinct developmental potentials: a proximally located group of multipotent adult precursor cells (P-fate) and a distally located population of more differentiated cells (D-fate). We show that the GATA-family transcription factor (TF) Grain promotes the P-fate and the POU-homeobox TF Ventral veinless (Vvl/Drifter/U-turned) stimulates the D-fate. Hedgehog and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling cooperate with Vvl to drive the D-fate at the expense of the P-fate while negative regulators of either of these signaling pathways ensure P-fate specification. Local concentrations of Decapentaplegic/BMP, Wingless/Wnt, and Hedgehog signals differentially regulate the expression of D-factors and P-factors to transform an equipotent primordial field into a concentric pattern of radially different morphogenetic potentials, which gradually gives rise to the distal-proximal organization of distinct cell types in the mature airway.",2015,"Ryo Matsuda, Chie Hosono, Christos Samakovlis, Kaoru Saigo, Ryo Matsuda, Chie Hosono, Christos Samakovlis, Kaoru Saigo"
"Implication of coronin 7 in body weight regulation in humans, mice and flies",25887538,10.1186/s12868-015-0151-9,"Background:
        
      
      Obesity is a growing global concern with strong associations with cardiovascular disease, cancer and type-2 diabetes. Although various genome-wide association studies have identified more than 40 genes associated with obesity, these genes cannot fully explain the heritability of obesity, suggesting there may be other contributing factors, including epigenetic effects.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We performed genome wide DNA methylation profiling comparing normal-weight and obese 9-13 year old children to investigate possible epigenetic changes correlated with obesity. Of note, obese children had significantly lower methylation levels at a CpG site located near coronin 7 (CORO7), which encodes a tryptophan-aspartic acid dipeptide (WD)-repeat containing protein most likely involved in Golgi complex morphology and function. Anatomical profiling of coronin 7 (Coro7) mRNA expression in mice revealed that it is highly expressed in appetite and energy balance regulating regions, including the hypothalamus, striatum and locus coeruleus, the main noradrenergic brain site. Interestingly, we found that food deprivation in mice downregulates hypothalamic Coro7 mRNA levels, and injecting ethanol, an appetite stimulant, increased the number of Coro7 expressing cells in the locus coeruleus. Finally, by employing the genetically-tractable Drosophila melanogaster model we were able to demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved metabolic function for the CORO7 homologue pod1. Knocking down the pod1 in the Drosophila adult nervous system increased their resistance to starvation. Furthermore, feeding flies a high-calorie diet significantly increased pod1 expression.
    


          Conclusion:

Enhancer-core-promoter specificity separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulation,25517091,10.1038/nature13994,"Gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of RNA polymerase II at core promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by enhancers that can be located more distally. However, how ubiquitous expression of housekeeping genes is achieved has been less clear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers. This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions, including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes. Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells (OSCs) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters--one derived from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a developmentally regulated transcription factor--and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition, we identify two transcription factors--Dref and Trl--that bind and activate housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter specificity that separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome.",2015,"Muhammad A Zabidi, Cosmas D Arnold, Katharina Schernhuber, Michaela Pagani, Martina Rath, Olga Frank, Alexander Stark, Muhammad A Zabidi, Cosmas D Arnold, Katharina Schernhuber, Michaela Pagani, Martina Rath, Olga Frank, Alexander Stark"

Mechanistically, Tor kinase is less active in Vps16A mutants likely due to impaired endocytic and biosynthetic transport to the lysosome, a site of its activation. Tor reactivation by overexpression of Rheb suppresses autophagosome formation and restores growth and developmental timing in these animals. Thus, Vps16A reduces autophagosome numbers both by indirectly restricting their formation rate and by directly promoting their clearance. In contrast, the loss of Syx17 blocks autophagic flux without affecting the induction step in Drosophila.",2015,"Szabolcs Takáts, Ágnes Varga, Karolina Pircs, Gábor Juhász, Szabolcs Takáts, Ágnes Varga, Karolina Pircs, Gábor Juhász"
RdgB2 is required for dim-light input into intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells,26269578,10.1091/mbc.E15-05-0288,"A subset of retinal ganglion cells is intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs) and contributes directly to the pupillary light reflex and circadian photoentrainment under bright-light conditions. ipRGCs are also indirectly activated by light through cellular circuits initiated in rods and cones. A mammalian homologue (RdgB2) of a phosphoinositide transfer/exchange protein that functions in Drosophila phototransduction is expressed in the retinal ganglion cell layer. This raised the possibility that RdgB2 might function in the intrinsic light response in ipRGCs, which depends on a cascade reminiscent of Drosophila phototransduction. Here we found that under high light intensities, RdgB2(-/-) mutant mice showed normal pupillary light responses and circadian photoentrainment. Consistent with this behavioral phenotype, the intrinsic light responses of ipRGCs in RdgB2(-/-) were indistinguishable from wild-type. In contrast, under low-light conditions, RdgB2(-/-) mutants displayed defects in both circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light response. The RdgB2 protein was not expressed in ipRGCs but was in GABAergic amacrine cells, which provided inhibitory feedback onto bipolar cells. We propose that RdgB2 is required in a cellular circuit that transduces light input from rods to bipolar cells that are coupled to GABAergic amacrine cells and ultimately to ipRGCs, thereby enabling ipRGCs to respond to dim light.",2015,"Marquis T Walker, Alan Rupp, Rebecca Elsaesser, Ali D Güler, Wenlong Sheng, Shijun Weng, David M Berson, Samer Hattar, Craig Montell, Marquis T Walker, Alan Rupp, Rebecca Elsaesser, Ali D Güler, Wenlong Sheng, Shijun Weng, David M Berson, Samer Hattar, Craig Montell"
The cricket paralysis virus suppressor inhibits microRNA silencing mediated by the Drosophila Argonaute-2 protein,25793377,10.1371/journal.pone.0120205,"Small RNAs are potent regulators of gene expression. They also act in defense pathways against invading nucleic acids such as transposable elements or viruses. To counteract these defenses, viruses have evolved viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). Plant viruses encoded VSRs interfere with siRNAs or miRNAs by targeting common mediators of these two pathways. In contrast, VSRs identified in insect viruses to date only interfere with the siRNA pathway whose effector Argonaute protein is Argonaute-2 (Ago-2). Although a majority of Drosophila miRNAs exerts their silencing activity through their loading into the Argonaute-1 protein, recent studies highlighted that a fraction of miRNAs can be loaded into Ago-2, thus acting as siRNAs. In light of these recent findings, we re-examined the role of insect VSRs on Ago-2-mediated miRNA silencing in Drosophila melanogaster. Using specific reporter systems in cultured Schneider-2 cells and transgenic flies, we showed here that the Cricket Paralysis virus VSR CrPV1-A but not the Flock House virus B2 VSR abolishes silencing by miRNAs loaded into the Ago-2 protein.

New genes from non-coding sequence: the role of de novo protein-coding genes in eukaryotic evolutionary innovation,26323763,10.1098/rstb.2014.0332,"The origin of novel protein-coding genes de novo was once considered so improbable as to be impossible.

There is now evidence that this mechanism has contributed a significant number of genes to genomes of organisms as diverse as Saccharomyces, Drosophila, Plasmodium, Arabidopisis and human. From simple beginnings, these genes have in some instances acquired complex structure, regulated expression and important functional roles. New genes are often thought of as dispensable late additions; however, some recent de novo genes in human can play a role in disease. Rather than an extremely rare occurrence, it is now evident that there is a relatively constant trickle of proto-genes released into the testing ground of natural selection. It is currently unknown whether de novo genes arise primarily through an 'RNA-first' or 'ORF-first' pathway.

This multilayered circuit is organized such that neurons within each layer are sufficient to specifically elicit antennal grooming. However, we find differences in the durations of antennal grooming elicited by neurons in the different layers, suggesting that the circuit is organized to both command antennal grooming and control its duration.

          Results:
        
      
      We found that the amount of proteins and transcripts of an Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperone Heat shock protein cognate 3 (HSC3) and a mitochondria chaperone Heat Shock Protein 22 (HSP22) were significantly increased in the HTorA(ΔE)- expressing brains compared to the normal HTorA (HTorA(WT)) expressing brains. The physiological consequences included an increased susceptibility to oxidative and ER stress compared to normal HTorA(WT) flies. The alteration of transcripts of Inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1)-dependent spliced X box binding protein 1(Xbp1), several ER chaperones, a nucleotide exchange factor, Autophagy related protein 8b (ATG8b) and components of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and increased expression of the Xbp1-enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (eGFP) in HTorA(ΔE) brains strongly indicated the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR).

Physiological effects of heat stress on Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila: genome-wide expression patterns and stress-related traits,27293683,10.1093/conphys/cou062,"Climate change is compounding the threats to the future of biodiversity, already impacted by habitat loss, invasive species and diseases. In the Hawaiian Islands, many of the endemic species have narrow habitat ranges that make them especially vulnerable to climate change. The Hawaiian Drosophila, a remarkably diverse group of species with 11 listed as federally endangered, are thought to be sensitive to temperature changes. To examine the species differences in sensitivity of Hawaiian picture-wing Drosophila to temperature changes, wild populations of Drosophila sproati, a relatively common species, and Drosophila silvestris, a rare species, were collected from two locations on Hawaii Island and bred in common laboratory conditions. Adult flies were exposed to hot and cold temperatures and compared with adult flies at control temperatures. Drosophila silvestris adults were less tolerant to heat stress than D. sproati for both survival and sperm mobility. In contrast, D. silvestris adults were more tolerant to cold stress than D. sproati for adult survival. The expression of 4950 Gene Ontology annotated gene transcripts was also analysed in high-temperature-treated and control males to identify candidate genes related to heat tolerance. There were more than twice as many transcripts differentially expressed after high temperature treatment for D. silvestris (246 transcripts) as for D. sproati (106 transcripts), with 13 Gene Ontology terms enriched between temperatures for D. silvestris and merely three in D. sproati. The combined results are consistent with D. sproati occurring more widely today as well as occurring at lower elevations than D. silvestris and with a genetically based temperature response, which is more severe in D. silvestris at high temperatures than that in D. sproati.

A common species in the survey was Drosophila (Drosophila) gentica Wheeler and Takada, previously collected only once, in El Salvador. It belongs to the flavopilosa species group, all species of which have been known until now from central Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, to Veracruz, Mexico and the Caribbean, breeding in flowers of Cestrum (""jessamine"") and Sessea (Solanaceae). The Los Angeles populations are probably breeding in a native and/or introduced Cestrum; in addition, populations in San Luis Obispo County were visiting ornamental Cestrum. Drosophila gentica occurs as far north as San Francisco, where it was found breeding in Cestrum aurantiacum. D. gentica is redescribed and figured in detail for diagnostic and identification purposes. Specimens from Jamaica previously identified as D. gentica are a distinct species but are not formally described in lieu of complete male specimens. Rare in the Malaise traps was Drosophila (Sophophora) flavohirta Malloch, a common species in Australia on the blossoms of native Myrtaceae, found on introduced Eucalyptus in South Africa and both Eucalyptus and Syzygium in Madagascar; adults feed on myrtaceous pollen and nectar, larvae breed in the flowers. It is also redescribed in detail, including its unusual egg. This is the first New World report of this species; DNA sequences confirm it is a morphologically highly aberrant member of the D. melanogaster species group. This study reveals how intensive field sampling can uncover remarkable biodiversity in even the most urbanized areas.",2015,"David Grimaldi, Paul S Ginsberg, Lesley Thayer, Shane McEvey, Martin Hauser, Michael Turelli, Brian Brown, David Grimaldi, Paul S Ginsberg, Lesley Thayer, Shane McEvey, Martin Hauser, Michael Turelli, Brian Brown"
Navigation-specific neural coding in the visual system of Drosophila,26310914,10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.07.008,"Drosophila melanogaster are a good system in which to understand the minimal requirements for widespread visually guided behaviours such as navigation, due to their small brains (adults possess only 100,000 neurons) and the availability of neurogenetic techniques which allow the identification of task-specific cell types. Recently published data describe the receptive fields for two classes of visually responsive neurons (R2 and R3/R4d ring neurons in the central complex) that are essential for visual tasks such as orientation memory for salient objects and simple pattern discriminations. What is interesting is that these cells have very large receptive fields and are very small in number, suggesting that each sub-population of cells might be a bottleneck in the processing of visual information for a specific behaviour, as each subset of cells effectively condenses information from approximately 3000 visual receptors in the eye, to fewer than 50 neurons in total. It has recently been shown how R1 ring neurons, which receive input from the same areas as the R2 and R3/R4d cells, are necessary for place learning in Drosophila. However, how R1 neurons enable place learning is unknown. By examining the information provided by different populations of hypothetical visual neurons in simulations of experimental arenas, we show that neurons with ring neuron-like receptive fields are sufficient for defining a location visually. In this way we provide a link between the type of information conveyed by ring neurons and the behaviour they support.",2015,"Alex D M Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Paul Graham, Andrew Philippides, Alex D M Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Paul Graham, Andrew Philippides"
Efficient backsplicing produces translatable circular mRNAs,25449546,10.1261/rna.048272.114,"While the human transcriptome contains a large number of circular RNAs (circRNAs), the functions of most circRNAs remain unclear. Sequence annotation suggests that most circRNAs are generated from splicing in reversed orders across exons. However, the mechanisms of this backsplicing are largely unknown. Here we constructed a single exon minigene containing split GFP, and found that the pre-mRNA indeed produces circRNA through efficient backsplicing in human and Drosophila cells. The backsplicing is enhanced by complementary introns that form double-stranded RNA structure to bring splice sites in proximity, but such structure is not required. Moreover, backsplicing is regulated by general splicing factors and cis-elements, but with regulatory rules distinct from canonical splicing. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. Unlike linear mRNA, poly-adenosine or poly-thymidine in 3' UTR can inhibit circular mRNA translation. This study revealed that backsplicing can occur efficiently in diverse eukaryotes to generate circular mRNAs.",2015,"Yang Wang, Zefeng Wang, Yang Wang, Zefeng Wang"
Origins of Knowledge: Insights from Precocial Species,26696856,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00338,"Behavioral responses are influenced by knowledge acquired during the lifetime of an individual and by predispositions transmitted across generations. Establishing the origin of knowledge and the role of the unlearned component is a challenging task, given that both learned and unlearned knowledge can orient perception, learning, and the encoding of environmental features since the first stages of life. Ethical and practical issues constrain the investigation of unlearned knowledge in altricial species, including human beings. On the contrary, precocial animals can be tested on a wide range of tasks and capabilities immediately after birth and in controlled rearing conditions. Insects and precocial avian species are very convenient models to dissect the knowledge systems that enable young individuals to cope with their environment in the absence of specific previous experience. We present the state of the art of research on the origins of knowledge that comes from different models and disciplines. Insects have been mainly used to investigate unlearned sensory preferences and prepared learning mechanisms. The relative simplicity of the neural system and fast life cycle of insects make them ideal models to investigate the neural circuitry and evolutionary dynamics of unlearned traits. Among avian species, chicks of the domestic fowl have been the focus of many studies, and showed to possess unlearned knowledge in the sensory, physical, spatial, numerical and social domains. Solid evidence shows the existence of unlearned knowledge in different domains in several species, from sensory and social preferences to the left-right representation of the mental number line. We show how non-mammalian models of cognition, and in particular precocial species, can shed light into the adaptive value and evolutionary history of unlearned knowledge.",2015,"Elisabetta Versace, Giorgio Vallortigara, Elisabetta Versace, Giorgio Vallortigara"
Versatile genetic paintbrushes: Brainbow technologies,25491327,10.1002/wdev.166,"Advances in labeling technologies are instrumental to study the developmental mechanisms that control organ formation and function at the cellular level. Until recently, genetic tools relied on the expression of single markers to visualize individual cells or lineages in developing and adult animals. Exploiting the expanding color palette of fluorescent proteins and the power of site-specific recombinases in rearranging DNA fragments, the development of Brainbow strategies in mice made it possible to stochastically label many cells in different colors within the same sample. Over the past years, these pioneering approaches have been adapted for other experimental model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster, zebrafish, and chicken. Balancing the distinct requirements of single cell and clonal analyses, adjustments were made that both enhance and expand the functionality of these tools. Multicolor cell labeling techniques have been successfully applied in studies analyzing the cellular components of neural circuits and other tissues, and the compositions and interactions of lineages. While being continuously refined, Brainbow technologies have thus found a firm place in the genetic toolboxes of developmental and neurobiologists.

Essential role of POLDIP2 in Tau aggregation and neurotoxicity via autophagy/proteasome inhibition,25930997,10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.04.084,"In Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathy, abnormal Tau proteins form intracellular aggregates and Tau filaments. However, the mechanisms that regulate Tau aggregation are not fully understood. In this paper, we show that POLDIP2 is a novel regulator of Tau aggregation. From a cell-based screening using cDNA expression library, we isolated POLDIP2 which increased Tau aggregation. Expression of POLDIP2 was increased in neuronal cells by the multiple stresses, including Aβ, TNF-α and H2O2. Accordingly, ectopic expression of POLDIP2 enhanced the formation of Tau aggregates without affecting Tau phosphorylation, while down-regulation of POLDIP2 alleviated ROS-induced Tau aggregation. Interestingly, we found that POLDIP2 overexpression induced impairments of autophagy activity and partially proteasome activity and this activities were retained in DUF525 domain of POLDIP2. In a drosophila model of human tauopathy, knockdown of the drosophila POLDIP2 homolog, CG12162, attenuated rough eye phenotype induced by Tau overexpression. Further, the lifespan of neural-Tau(R406W) transgenic files were recovered by CG12162 knockdown. Together, these observations indicate that POLDIP2 plays a crucial role in Tau aggregation via the impairment of autophagy activity, providing insight into Tau aggregation in Tau pathology.",2015,"YoungDoo Kim, Hyejin Park, Jihoon Nah, Seowon Moon, WonJae Lee, Se-Hoon Hong, Tae-In Kam, Yong-Keun Jung, YoungDoo Kim, Hyejin Park, Jihoon Nah, Seowon Moon, WonJae Lee, Se-Hoon Hong, Tae-In Kam, Yong-Keun Jung"
La FAM fatale: USP9X in development and disease,25672900,10.1007/s00018-015-1851-0,"Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs), act downstream of ubiquitylation. As such, these post-post-translational modifiers function as the final arbitrators of a protein substrate's ubiquitylation status, thus regulating its fate. In most instances, DUBs moderate the absolute level of a substrate, its locality or activity, rather than being an ""all-or-none"" phenomenon. Yet, disruption of this quantitative regulation can produce dramatic qualitative differences. The ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X/FAM) is a substrate-specific DUB, which displays an extraordinarily high level of sequence conservation from Drosophila to mammals. It is primarily the recent revelations of USP9X's pivotal role in human cancers, both as oncogene or tumour suppressor, in developmental disorders including intellectual disability, epilepsy, autism and developmental delay that has led to a subsequent re-examination of its molecular and cellular functions. Results from experimental animal models have implicated USP9X in neurodegeneration, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as well as autoimmune diseases. In this review, we describe the current and accumulated knowledge on the molecular, cellular and developmental aspects of USP9X function within the context of the biological consequences during normal development and disease.",2015,"Mariyam Murtaza, Lachlan A Jolly, Jozef Gecz, Stephen A Wood, Mariyam Murtaza, Lachlan A Jolly, Jozef Gecz, Stephen A Wood"
Mycalolide B dissociates dynactin and abolishes retrograde axonal transport of dense-core vesicles,26023088,10.1091/mbc.E14-11-1564,"Axonal transport is critical for maintaining synaptic transmission. Of interest, anterograde and retrograde axonal transport appear to be interdependent, as perturbing one directional motor often impairs movement in the opposite direction. Here live imaging of Drosophila and hippocampal neuron dense-core vesicles (DCVs) containing a neuropeptide or brain-derived neurotrophic factor shows that the F-actin depolymerizing macrolide toxin mycalolide B (MB) rapidly and selectively abolishes retrograde, but not anterograde, transport in the axon and the nerve terminal. Latrunculin A does not mimic MB, demonstrating that F-actin depolymerization is not responsible for unidirectional transport inhibition. Given that dynactin initiates retrograde transport and that amino acid sequences implicated in macrolide toxin binding are found in the dynactin component actin-related protein 1, we examined dynactin integrity. Remarkably, cell extract and purified protein experiments show that MB induces disassembly of the dynactin complex. Thus imaging selective retrograde transport inhibition led to the discovery of a small-molecule dynactin disruptor. The rapid unidirectional inhibition by MB suggests that dynactin is absolutely required for retrograde DCV transport but does not directly facilitate ongoing anterograde DCV transport in the axon or nerve terminal. More generally, MB's effects bolster the conclusion that anterograde and retrograde axonal transport are not necessarily interdependent.",2015,"Samantha L Cavolo, Chaoming Zhou, Stephanie A Ketcham, Matthew M Suzuki, Kresimir Ukalovic, Michael A Silverman, Trina A Schroer, Edwin S Levitan, Samantha L Cavolo, Chaoming Zhou, Stephanie A Ketcham, Matthew M Suzuki, Kresimir Ukalovic, Michael A Silverman, Trina A Schroer, Edwin S Levitan"
Muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-Myc cascade reactivates dormant Adult Muscle Precursors in Drosophila,26650355,10.7554/eLife.08497,"How stem cells specified during development keep their non-differentiated quiescent state, and how they are reactivated, remain poorly understood. Here, we applied a Drosophila model to follow in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the transient fruit fly muscle stem cells. We report that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles. AMPs keep their filopodia-based association with muscles throughout their dormant state but also when they start to proliferate, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Altogether, we report that Drosophila AMPs display homing behavior to muscle niche and that the niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs.",2015,"Rajaguru Aradhya, Monika Zmojdzian, Jean Philippe Da Ponte, Krzysztof Jagla, Rajaguru Aradhya, Monika Zmojdzian, Jean Philippe Da Ponte, Krzysztof Jagla"

Unfavorable TBI outcomes result from primary mechanical injuries to the brain and ensuing secondary non-mechanical injuries that are not limited to the brain. Our genome-wide association study of Drosophila melanogaster revealed that the probability of death following TBI is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in tissue barrier function and glucose homeostasis. We found that TBI causes intestinal and blood-brain barrier dysfunction and that intestinal barrier dysfunction is highly correlated with the probability of death. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of glucose after a primary injury increases the probability of death through a secondary injury mechanism that exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction.

Apocrine secretion: New insights into an old phenomenon,25960390,10.1016/j.bbagen.2015.05.003,"Background:
        
      
      While apocrine secretion was among the earliest secretory mechanisms to be identified, its underlying basis remains poorly understood.
    


          Scope of review:
        
      
      This review reappraises our understanding of apocrine secretion using insights about apocrine secretion from the salivary glands of Drosophila, in which molecular genetic analyses have provided a glimmer of hope for elucidating the mechanistic aspects of this fundamental process.
    


          Major conclusions:
        
      
      In contrast to the well-defined process of exocytosis, apocrine secretion is non-vesicular transport and secretory pathway that entails the loss of part of the cytoplasm. It often involves apical protrusions and generates cytoplasmic fragments inside a secretory lumen. In its most intense phase this process is accompanied by the release of large fragments of cellular structures and entire organelles that include mitochondria, Golgi, and portions of the endoplasmic reticulum, among others. Proteomic analyses revealed that the secretion is composed of hundreds to thousands of membranous, cytoskeletal, microsomal, mitochondrial, ribosomal, and even nuclear as well as nucleolar proteins. Strikingly, although many nuclear proteins are released, the nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid itself remains intact. In spite of this complexity, it appears that several protein components of apocrine secretion are identical, regardless of the location of the apocrine gland.
    


          General significance:
        
      
      This type of secretion appears to be common to many, if not all, barrier epithelial tissues including skin derivatives and the epididymis, and is implicated also in lung/bronchi and intestinal epithelium. Apocrine secretion is a mechanism that provides the en masse delivery of a very complex proteinaceous mixture from polarized epithelial tissues to allow for communication at exterior interfaces.",2015,"Robert Farkaš, Robert Farkaš"

H2Aub is essential for viability and required for efficient histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation by PRC2 early in embryogenesis. However, H2Aub-deficient animals fully maintain repression of PRC1 target genes and do not show phenotypes characteristic of Polycomb group mutants.

Circadian Activators Are Expressed Days before They Initiate Clock Function in Late Pacemaker Neurons from Drosophila,26041931,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0250-15.2015,"Circadian pacemaker neurons in the Drosophila brain control daily rhythms in locomotor activity. These pacemaker neurons can be subdivided into early or late groups depending on whether rhythms in period (per) and timeless (tim) expression are initiated at the first instar (L1) larval stage or during metamorphosis, respectively. Because CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) heterodimers initiate circadian oscillator function by activating per and tim transcription, a Clk-GFP transgene was used to mark when late pacemaker neurons begin to develop. We were surprised to see that CLK-GFP was already expressed in four of five clusters of late pacemaker neurons during the third instar (L3) larval stage. CLK-GFP is only detected in postmitotic neurons from L3 larvae, suggesting that these four late pacemaker neuron clusters are formed before the L3 larval stage. A GFP-cyc transgene was used to show that CYC, like CLK, is also expressed exclusively in pacemaker neurons from L3 larval brains, demonstrating that CLK-CYC is not sufficient to activate per and tim in late pacemaker neurons at the L3 larval stage. These results suggest that most late pacemaker neurons develop days before novel factors activate circadian oscillator function during metamorphosis.",2015,"Tianxin Liu, Guruswamy Mahesh, Jerry H Houl, Paul E Hardin, Tianxin Liu, Guruswamy Mahesh, Jerry H Houl, Paul E Hardin"
DnaJ-1 and karyopherin α3 suppress degeneration in a new Drosophila model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6,25954029,10.1093/hmg/ddv174,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) belongs to the family of CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ)-dependent neurodegenerative disorders. SCA6 is caused by abnormal expansion in a CAG trinucleotide repeat within exon 47 of CACNA1A, a bicistronic gene that encodes α1A, a P/Q-type calcium channel subunit and a C-terminal protein, termed α1ACT. Expansion of the CAG/polyQ region of CACNA1A occurs within α1ACT and leads to ataxia. There are few animal models of SCA6. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of the first Drosophila melanogaster models of SCA6, which express the entire human α1ACT protein with a normal or expanded polyQ. The polyQ-expanded version of α1ACT recapitulates the progressively degenerative nature of SCA6 when expressed in various fly tissues and the presence of densely staining aggregates. Additional studies identify the co-chaperone DnaJ-1 as a potential therapeutic target for SCA6. Expression of DnaJ-1 potently suppresses α1ACT-dependent degeneration and lethality, concomitant with decreased aggregation and reduced nuclear localization of the pathogenic protein. Mutating the nuclear importer karyopherin α3 also leads to reduced toxicity from pathogenic α1ACT. Little is known about the steps leading to degeneration in SCA6 and the means to protect neurons in this disease are lacking. Invertebrate animal models of SCA6 can expand our understanding of molecular sequelae related to degeneration in this disorder and lead to the rapid identification of cellular components that can be targeted to treat it.",2015,"Wei-Ling Tsou, Ryan R Hosking, Aaron A Burr, Joanna R Sutton, Michelle Ouyang, Xiaofei Du, Christopher M Gomez, Sokol V Todi, Wei-Ling Tsou, Ryan R Hosking, Aaron A Burr, Joanna R Sutton, Michelle Ouyang, Xiaofei Du, Christopher M Gomez, Sokol V Todi"
Transcriptomic identification of starfish neuropeptide precursors yields new insights into neuropeptide evolution,26865025,10.1098/rsob.150224,"Neuropeptides are evolutionarily ancient mediators of neuronal signalling in nervous systems. With recent advances in genomics/transcriptomics, an increasingly wide range of species has become accessible for molecular analysis.

Multiple Roles for Egalitarian in Polarization of the Drosophila Egg Chamber,27017624,10.1534/genetics.115.184622,"The Drosophila egg chamber provides a useful model for examining mechanisms by which cell fates are specified and maintained in the context of a complex tissue. The egg chamber is also an excellent model for understanding the mechanism by which cytoskeletal filaments are organized and the critical interplay between cytoskeletal organization, polarity establishment, and cell fate specification. Previous work has shown that Egalitarian (Egl) is required for specification and maintenance of oocyte fate. Mutants in egl either completely fail to specify an oocyte, or if specified, the oocyte eventually reverts back to nurse cell fate. Due to this very early role for Egl in egg chamber maturation, it is unclear whether later stages of egg chamber development also require Egl function. In this report, we have depleted Egl at specific stages of egg chamber development. We demonstrate that in early-stage egg chambers, Egl has an additional role in organization of oocyte microtubules. In the absence of Egl function, oocyte microtubules completely fail to reorganize. As such, the localization of microtubule motors and their cargo is disrupted. In addition, Egl also appears to function in regulating the translation of critical polarity determining messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Finally, we demonstrate that in midstage egg chambers, Egl does not appear to be required for microtubule organization, but rather for the correct spatial localization of oskar, bicoid, and gurken mRNAs.",2016,"Paulomi Sanghavi, Guojun Liu, Rajalakshmi Veeranan-Karmegam, Caryn Navarro, Graydon B Gonsalvez, Paulomi Sanghavi, Guojun Liu, Rajalakshmi Veeranan-Karmegam, Caryn Navarro, Graydon B Gonsalvez"

Both these periods may be reduced or increased by applying an appropriate configuration of external 3D LFEMFs. We report that the longevity of D. melanogaster imagoes correlates with the duration of the egg-to-imago development period of the respective eggs. We infer that metabolic processes in both eggs and imago are either accelerated (resulting in reduced time periods) or slowed down (resulting in increased time periods). We propose that external 3D LFEMFs induce electric currents in live systems as well as mechanical vibrations on sub-cell, whole-cell and cell-group levels. These external fields induce media polarization due to ionic motion and orientation of electric dipoles that could moderate the observed effects. We found that the longevity of D. melanogaster imagoes is affected by action of 3D LFEMFs on the respective eggs in the embryonic development period (EDP). We interpret this effect as resulting from changes in the regulation mechanism of metabolic processes in D. melanogaster eggs, inherited by the resulting imagoes.

Some cells activated caspase-3 during their normal development in every cell and in every animal without evidence of apoptosis. In other tissues, such as the brain, expression was sporadic both temporally and spatially and overlapped with periods of apoptosis.

Flies exposed to the scent of mantids in the breeding season did not produce fewer offspring, but their offspring developed faster and weighed less as adults compared to the controls.

By reducing the incidence or severity of infection, these symbionts have the potential to reduce the strength of selection on genes in the insect genome that increase resistance. Therefore, the presence of such symbionts may slow down the evolution of resistance. Here we investigated this idea by exposing Drosophila melanogaster populations to infection with the pathogenic Drosophila C virus (DCV) in the presence or absence of Wolbachia, a heritable symbiont of arthropods that confers protection against viruses. After nine generations of selection, we found that resistance to DCV had increased in all populations. However, in the presence of Wolbachia the resistant allele of pastrel-a gene that has a major effect on resistance to DCV-was at a lower frequency than in the symbiont-free populations. This finding suggests that defensive symbionts have the potential to hamper the evolution of insect resistance genes, potentially leading to a state of evolutionary addiction where the genetically susceptible insect host mostly relies on its symbiont to fight pathogens.",2016,"Julien Martinez, Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Sophie Smith, Christopher J R Illingworth, Francis M Jiggins, Julien Martinez, Rodrigo Cogni, Chuan Cao, Sophie Smith, Christopher J R Illingworth, Francis M Jiggins"
Discrete Mesh Approach in Morphogenesis Modelling: the Example of Gastrulation,27853896,10.1007/s10441-016-9301-4,"Morphogenesis is a general concept in biology including all the processes which generate tissue shapes and cellular organizations in a living organism. Many hybrid formalizations (i.e., with both discrete and continuous parts) have been proposed for modelling morphogenesis in embryonic or adult animals, like gastrulation. We propose first to study the ventral furrow invagination as the initial step of gastrulation, early stage of embryogenesis. We focus on the study of the connection between the apical constriction of the ventral cells and the initiation of the invagination. For that, we have created a 3D biomechanical model of the embryo of the Drosophila melanogaster based on the finite element method. Each cell is modelled by an elastic hexahedron contour and is firmly attached to its neighbouring cells. A uniform initial distribution of elastic and contractile forces is applied to cells along the model. Numerical simulations show that invagination starts at ventral curved extremities of the embryo and then propagates to the ventral medial layer. Then, this observation already made in some experiments can be attributed uniquely to the specific shape of the embryo and we provide mechanical evidence to support it. Results of the simulations of the ""pill-shaped"" geometry of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo are compared with those of a spherical geometry corresponding to the Xenopus lævis embryo. Eventually, we propose to study the influence of cell proliferation on the end of the process of invagination represented by the closure of the ventral furrow.",2016,"J Demongeot, A Lontos, E Promayon, J Demongeot, A Lontos, E Promayon"
Hydrogen Sulfide--Mechanisms of Toxicity and Development of an Antidote,26877209,10.1038/srep20831,"Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic gas-second only to carbon monoxide as a cause of inhalational deaths. Its mechanism of toxicity is only partially known, and no specific therapy exists for sulfide poisoning. We show in several cell types, including human inducible pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons, that sulfide inhibited complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and induced apoptosis. Sulfide increased hydroxyl radical production in isolated mouse heart mitochondria and F2-isoprostanes in brains and hearts of mice. The vitamin B12 analog cobinamide reversed the cellular toxicity of sulfide, and rescued Drosophila melanogaster and mice from lethal exposures of hydrogen sulfide gas. Cobinamide worked through two distinct mechanisms: direct reversal of complex IV inhibition and neutralization of sulfide-generated reactive oxygen species. We conclude that sulfide produces a high degree of oxidative stress in cells and tissues, and that cobinamide has promise as a first specific treatment for sulfide poisoning.",2016,"Jingjing Jiang, Adriano Chan, Sameh Ali, Arindam Saha, Kristofer J Haushalter, Wai-Ling Macrina Lam, Megan Glasheen, James Parker, Matthew Brenner, Sari B Mahon, Hemal H Patel, Rajesh Ambasudhan, Stuart A Lipton, Renate B Pilz, Gerry R Boss, Jingjing Jiang, Adriano Chan, Sameh Ali, Arindam Saha, Kristofer J Haushalter, Wai-Ling Macrina Lam, Megan Glasheen, James Parker, Matthew Brenner, Sari B Mahon, Hemal H Patel, Rajesh Ambasudhan, Stuart A Lipton, Renate B Pilz, Gerry R Boss"
Dominance from the perspective of gene-gene and gene-chemical interactions,26613610,10.1007/s10709-015-9875-9,"In this study, we used genetic interaction (GI) and gene-chemical interaction (GCI) data to compare mutations with different dominance phenotypes. Our analysis focused primarily on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where haploinsufficient genes (HI; genes with dominant loss-of-function mutations) were found to be participating in gene expression processes, namely, the translation and regulation of gene transcription. Non-ribosomal HI genes (mainly regulators of gene transcription) were found to have more GIs and GCIs than haplosufficient (HS) genes. Several properties seem to lead to the enrichment of interactions, most notably, the following: importance, pleiotropy, gene expression level and gene expression variation. Importantly, after these properties were appropriately considered in the analysis, the correlation between dominance and GI/GCI degrees was still observed. Strikingly, for the GCIs of heterozygous strains, haploinsufficiency was the only property significantly correlated with the number of GCIs. We found ribosomal HI genes to be depleted in GIs/GCIs. This finding can be explained by their high variation in gene expression under different genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions. We observed the same distributions of GIs among non-ribosomal HI, ribosomal HI and HS genes in three other species: Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens. One potentially interesting exception was the lack of significant differences in the degree of GIs between non-ribosomal HI and HS genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.",2016,"Arkadiusz Gladki, Piotr Zielenkiewicz, Szymon Kaczanowski, Arkadiusz Gladki, Piotr Zielenkiewicz, Szymon Kaczanowski"
Bioinformatic analyses of sense and antisense expression from terminal inverted repeat transposons in Drosophila somatic cells,26986720,10.1080/19336934.2016.1165372,"Understanding regulation of transposon movement in somatic cells is important as mobile elements can cause detrimental genomic rearrangements. Generally, transposons move via one of 2 mechanisms; retrotransposons utilize an RNA intermediate, therefore copying themselves and amplifying throughout the genome, while terminal inverted repeat transposons (TIR Tns) excise DNA sequences from the genome and integrate into a new location. Our recently published work indicates that retrotransposons in Drosophila tissue culture cells are actively transcribed in the antisense direction. Our data support a model in which convergent transcription of retrotransposons from intra element transcription start sites results in complementary RNAs that hybridize to form substrates for Dicer-2, the endogenous small interfering (esi)RNA generating enzyme. Here, we extend our previous analysis to TIR Tns. In contrast to retrotransposons, our data show that antisense TIR Tn RNAs result from transcription of intronic TIR Tns oriented antisense to their host genes. Also, disproportionately less esiRNAs are generated from TIR transcripts than from retrotransposons and transcription of very few individual TIR Tns could be confirmed. Collectively, these data support a model in which TIR Tns are regulated at the level of Transposase production while retrotransposons are regulated with esiRNA post-transcriptional mechanisms in Drosophila somatic cells.",2016,"Andrew W Harrington, Mindy Steiniger, Andrew W Harrington, Mindy Steiniger"
The Genetic Basis of Pigmentation Differences Within and Between Drosophila Species,27282023,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2016.03.004,"In Drosophila, as well as in many other plants and animals, pigmentation is highly variable both within and between species. This variability, combined with powerful genetic and transgenic tools as well as knowledge of how pigment patterns are formed biochemically and developmentally, has made Drosophila pigmentation a premier system for investigating the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for phenotypic evolution. In this chapter, we review and synthesize findings from a rapidly growing body of case studies examining the genetic basis of pigmentation differences in the abdomen, thorax, wings, and pupal cases within and between Drosophila species. A core set of genes, including genes required for pigment synthesis (eg, yellow, ebony, tan, Dat) as well as developmental regulators of these genes (eg, bab1, bab2, omb, Dll, and wg), emerge as the primary sources of this variation, with most genes having been shown to contribute to pigmentation differences both within and between species. In cases where specific genetic changes contributing to pigmentation divergence were identified in these genes, the changes were always located in noncoding sequences and affected cis-regulatory activity. We conclude this chapter by discussing these and other lessons learned from evolutionary genetic studies of Drosophila pigmentation and identify topics we think should be the focus of future work with this model system.",2016,"J H Massey, P J Wittkopp, J H Massey, P J Wittkopp"
The POU/Oct Transcription Factor Pdm1/nub Is Necessary for a Beneficial Gut Microbiota and Normal Lifespan of Drosophila,27231014,10.1159/000446368,"Maintenance of a stable gut microbial community relies on a delicate balance between immune defense and immune tolerance. We have used Drosophila to study how the microbial gut flora is affected by changes in host genetic factors and immunity. Flies with a constitutively active gut immune system, due to a mutation in the POU transcriptional regulator Pdm1/nubbin (nub) gene, had higher loads of bacteria and a more diverse taxonomic composition than controls. In addition, the microbial composition shifted considerably during the short lifespan of the nub1 mutants. This shift was characterized by a loss of relatively few OTUs (operational taxonomic units) and a remarkable increase in a large number of Acetobacter spp. and Leuconostoc spp. Treating nub1 mutant flies with antibiotics prolonged their lifetime survival by more than 100%. Immune gene expression was also persistently high in the presence of antibiotics, indicating that the early death was not a direct consequence of an overactive immune defense but rather an indirect consequence of the microbial load and composition. Thus, changes in host genotype and an inability to regulate the normal growth and composition of the gut microbiota leads to a shift in the microbial community, dysbiosis and early death.",2016,"Widad Dantoft, Daniel Lundin, Shiva Seyedoleslami Esfahani, Ylva Engström, Widad Dantoft, Daniel Lundin, Shiva Seyedoleslami Esfahani, Ylva Engström"
Dynamics of memory-guided choice behavior in Drosophila,27725473,10.2183/pjab.92.346,"Memory retrieval requires both accuracy and speed. Olfactory learning of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful model system to identify molecular and neuronal substrates of memory and memory-guided behavior. The behavioral expression of olfactory memory has traditionally been tested as a conditioned odor response in a simple T-maze, which measures the result, but not the speed, of odor choice. Here, we developed multiplexed T-mazes that allow video recording of the choice behavior. Automatic fly counting in each arm of the maze visualizes choice dynamics. Using this setup, we show that the transient blockade of serotonergic neurons slows down the choice, while leaving the eventual choice intact. In contrast, activation of the same neurons impairs the eventual performance leaving the choice speed unchanged. Our new apparatus contributes to elucidating how the speed and the accuracy of memory retrieval are implemented in the fly brain.",2016,"Toshiharu Ichinose, Hiromu Tanimoto, Toshiharu Ichinose, Hiromu Tanimoto"
Integrating Display and Delivery Functionality with a Cell Penetrating Peptide Mimic as a Scaffold for Intracellular Multivalent Multitargeting,27355522,10.1021/jacs.6b03697,"The construction of a multivalent ligand is an effective way to increase affinity and selectivity toward biomolecular targets with multiple-ligand binding sites.

By assembling this polyvalent construct, the hydrophobic ligands are solubilized and delivered into cell nuclei, and their enhanced binding affinity leads to the inhibition of ribonuclear foci formation and a reversal of splicing defects, all at low concentrations. Some of the multivalent ligands are shown to inhibit selectively the in vitro transcription of (CTG·CAG)74, to reduce the concentration of the toxic CUG RNA in DM1 model cells, and to show phenotypic improvement in vivo in a Drosophila model of DM1.

The Genetic Architecture of Natural Variation in Recombination Rate in Drosophila melanogaster,27035832,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005951,"Meiotic recombination ensures proper chromosome segregation in many sexually reproducing organisms. Despite this crucial function, rates of recombination are highly variable within and between taxa, and the genetic basis of this variation remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit natural variation in the inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to map genetic variants affecting recombination rate. We used a two-step crossing scheme and visible markers to measure rates of recombination in a 33 cM interval on the X chromosome and in a 20.4 cM interval on chromosome 3R for 205 DGRP lines. Though we cannot exclude that some biases exist due to viability effects associated with the visible markers used in this study, we find ~2-fold variation in recombination rate among lines. Interestingly, we further find that recombination rates are uncorrelated between the two chromosomal intervals. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with recombination rate in each of the two intervals surveyed. We refined our list of candidate variants and genes associated with recombination rate variation and selected twenty genes for functional assessment. We present strong evidence that five genes are likely to contribute to natural variation in recombination rate in D. melanogaster; these genes lie outside the canonical meiotic recombination pathway. We also find a weak effect of Wolbachia infection on recombination rate and we confirm the interchromosomal effect. Our results highlight the magnitude of population variation in recombination rate present in D. melanogaster and implicate new genetic factors mediating natural variation in this quantitative trait.",2016,"Chad M Hunter, Wen Huang, Trudy F C Mackay, Nadia D Singh, Chad M Hunter, Wen Huang, Trudy F C Mackay, Nadia D Singh"

Modification of host population structure has potential applications for control of pest species, particularly if Wolbachia can be maintained, manipulated, and genetically engineered in vitro. Although Wolbachia maintains an obligate mutualism with genome stability in nematodes, arthropods can be co-infected with distinct Wolbachia strains, and horizontal gene transfer between strains is potentially mediated by WO phages encoded within Wolbachia genomes. Proteomic analysis of a robust, persistent infection of a mosquito cell line with wStr from the planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus, revealed expression of a full array of WO phage genes, as well as nine of ten non-phage genes that occur between two distinct clusters of WOMelB genes in the genome of wMel, which infects Drosophila melanogaster. These non-phage genes encode potential host-adaptive proteins and are expressed in wStr at higher levels than phage structural proteins. A subset of seven of the non-phage genes is flanked by highly conserved non-coding sequences, including a putative promoter element, that are not present in a syntenically arranged array of homologs in plasmids from three tick-associated Rickettsia spp. These studies expand our understanding of wStr in a host cell line derived from the mosquito, Aedes albopictus, and provide a basis for investigating conditions that favor the lytic phase of the WO phage life cycle and recovery of infectious phage particles.",2016,"Gerald D Baldridge, Todd W Markowski, Bruce A Witthuhn, LeeAnn Higgins, Abigail S Baldridge, Ann M Fallon, Gerald D Baldridge, Todd W Markowski, Bruce A Witthuhn, LeeAnn Higgins, Abigail S Baldridge, Ann M Fallon"
Behavioral Analysis of Bitter Taste Perception in Drosophila Larvae,26512069,10.1093/chemse/bjv061,"Insect larvae, which recognize food sources through chemosensory cues, are a major source of global agricultural loss. Gustation is an important factor that determines feeding behavior, and the gustatory receptors (Grs) act as molecular receptors that recognize diverse chemicals in gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs). The behavior of Drosophila larvae is relatively simpler than the adult fly, and a gustatory receptor-to-neuron map was established in a previous study of the major external larval head sensory organs. Here, we extensively study the bitter taste responses of larvae using 2-choice behavioral assays. First, we tested a panel of 23 candidate bitter compounds to compare the behavioral responses of larvae and adults. We define 9 bitter compounds which elicit aversive behavior in a dose-dependent manner. A functional map of the larval GRNs was constructed with the use of Gr-GAL4 lines that drive expression of UAS-tetanus toxin and UAS-VR1 in specific gustatory neurons to identify bitter tastants-GRN combinations by suppressing and activating discrete subsets of taste neurons, respectively.

Putative transmembrane transporter modulates higher-level aggression in Drosophila,28193893,10.1073/pnas.1618354114,"By selection of winners of dyadic fights for 35 generations, we have generated a hyperaggressive Bully line of flies that almost always win fights against the parental wild-type Canton-S stock. Maintenance of the Bully phenotype is temperature dependent during development, with the phenotype lost when flies are reared at 19 °C. No similar effect is seen with the parent line. This difference allowed us to carry out RNA-seq experiments and identify a limited number of genes that are differentially expressed by twofold or greater in the Bullies; one of these was a putative transmembrane transporter, CG13646, which showed consistent and reproducible twofold down-regulation in Bullies. We examined the causal effect of this gene on the phenotype with a mutant line for CG13646, and with an RNAi approach. In all cases, reduction in expression of CG13646 by approximately half led to a hyperaggressive phenotype partially resembling that seen in the Bully flies.

We observed the emergence of numerous D. suzukii, but no D. melanogaster flies, from bunches that started showing mild sour rot symptoms days after field collection. However, bunches that already showed severe rot symptoms in the field mostly contained D. melanogaster. In the laboratory, oviposition by D. suzukii triggered sour rot development. An independent assay showed the disease increased grape attractiveness to ovipositing D. melanogaster females.

In silico evolution of the Drosophila gap gene regulatory sequence under elevated mutational pressure,28251865,10.1186/s12862-016-0866-y,"Background:
        
      
      Cis-regulatory sequences are often composed of many low-affinity transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Determining the evolutionary and functional importance of regulatory sequence composition is impeded without a detailed knowledge of the genotype-phenotype map.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We simulate the evolution of regulatory sequences involved in Drosophila melanogaster embryo segmentation during early development. Natural selection evaluates gene expression dynamics produced by a computational model of the developmental network. We observe a dramatic decrease in the total number of transcription factor binding sites through the course of evolution. Despite a decrease in average sequence binding energies through time, the regulatory sequences tend towards organisations containing increased high affinity transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, the binding energies of separate sequence segments demonstrate ubiquitous mutual correlations through time. Fewer than 10% of initial TFBSs are maintained throughout the entire simulation, deemed 'core' sites. These sites have increased functional importance as assessed under wild-type conditions and their binding energy distributions are highly conserved. Furthermore, TFBSs within close proximity of core sites exhibit increased longevity, reflecting functional regulatory interactions with core sites.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      In response to elevated mutational pressure, evolution tends to sample regulatory sequence organisations with fewer, albeit on average, stronger functional transcription factor binding sites.

Estimating the parameters of background selection and selective sweeps in Drosophila in the presence of gene conversion,28559322,10.1073/pnas.1619434114,"We used whole-genome resequencing data from a population of Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the causes of the negative correlation between the within-population synonymous nucleotide site diversity (πS ) of a gene and its degree of divergence from related species at nonsynonymous nucleotide sites (KA ). By using the estimated distributions of mutational effects on fitness at nonsynonymous and UTR sites, we predicted the effects of background selection at sites within a gene on πS and found that these could account for only part of the observed correlation between πS and KA We developed a model of the effects of selective sweeps that included gene conversion as well as crossing over. We used this model to estimate the average strength of selection on positively selected mutations in coding sequences and in UTRs, as well as the proportions of new mutations that are selectively advantageous. Genes with high levels of selective constraint on nonsynonymous sites were found to have lower strengths of positive selection and lower proportions of advantageous mutations than genes with low levels of constraint. Overall, background selection and selective sweeps within a typical gene reduce its synonymous diversity to ∼75% of its value in the absence of selection, with larger reductions for genes with high KA Gene conversion has a major effect on the estimates of the parameters of positive selection, such that the estimated strength of selection on favorable mutations is greatly reduced if it is ignored.",2017,"José Luis Campos, Lei Zhao, Brian Charlesworth, José Luis Campos, Lei Zhao, Brian Charlesworth"

Embryos (newly fertilized eggs) were exposed to two atrazine concentrations (10μM and 100μM) in the diet until the adult fly emerged. Negative geotaxis assay, as well as exploratory behaviour, immobility time and number of grooming episodes in an open field system were assessed.

All analyzed parameters in male flies were not significantly affected by atrazine exposure. However female flies exposed to atrazine at 10μM presented an increase in immobility time and a reduction in exploratory activity in the open field test, which was offset by an increase in the number of grooming episodes. Also, female flies exposed to 100μM of atrazine presented an increase in immobility time. Gene expression of DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine (DA) receptors were also increased only in females.

The KIF5B-RET-transformed human bronchial cell line showed similar aspects of transformation, including invadopodia-like processes. Through a combination of genetic and biochemical studies, we demonstrate that the kinesin and kinase domains of KIF5B-RET act together to establish an emergent microtubule and RAB-vesicle-dependent RET-SRC-EGFR-FGFR signaling hub.

However, combining the RET inhibitor sorafenib with drugs that target EGFR, microtubules, or FGFR led to strong efficacy in both Drosophila and human cell line KIF5B-RET models. This work demonstrates the utility of exploring the full biology of fusions to identify rational therapeutic strategies.",2017,"Tirtha Kamal Das, Ross Leigh Cagan, Tirtha Kamal Das, Ross Leigh Cagan"
Polycomb and Trithorax Group Genes in Drosophila,28778878,10.1534/genetics.115.185116,"Polycomb group (PcG) and Trithorax group (TrxG) genes encode important regulators of development and differentiation in metazoans.

PcG genes collectively behave as genetic repressors of Hox genes, while the TrxG genes are necessary for HOX gene expression or function. Biochemical studies showed that many PcG proteins are present in two protein complexes, Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2, which repress transcription via chromatin modifications. TrxG proteins activate transcription via a variety of mechanisms.

Functional screening of Alzheimer risk loci identifies PTK2B as an in vivo modulator and early marker of Tau pathology,27113998,10.1038/mp.2016.59,"A recent genome-wide association meta-analysis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) identified 19 risk loci (in addition to APOE) in which the functional genes are unknown. Using Drosophila, we screened 296 constructs targeting orthologs of 54 candidate risk genes within these loci for their ability to modify Tau neurotoxicity by quantifying the size of >6000 eyes. Besides Drosophila Amph (ortholog of BIN1), which we previously implicated in Tau pathology, we identified p130CAS (CASS4), Eph (EPHA1), Fak (PTK2B) and Rab3-GEF (MADD) as Tau toxicity modulators. Of these, the focal adhesion kinase Fak behaved as a strong Tau toxicity suppressor in both the eye and an independent focal adhesion-related wing blister assay. Accordingly, the human Tau and PTK2B proteins biochemically interacted in vitro and PTK2B co-localized with hyperphosphorylated and oligomeric Tau in progressive pathological stages in the brains of AD patients and transgenic Tau mice.

Molecular population genetics of the Polycomb genes in Drosophila subobscura,28910411,10.1371/journal.pone.0185005,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are important regulatory factors that modulate the chromatin state. They form protein complexes that repress gene expression by the introduction of posttranslational histone modifications. The study of PcG proteins divergence in Drosophila revealed signals of coevolution among them and an acceleration of the nonsynonymous evolutionary rate in the lineage ancestral to the obscura group species, mainly in subunits of the Pcl-PRC2 complex. Herein, we have studied the nucleotide polymorphism of PcG genes in a natural population of D. subobscura to detect whether natural selection has also modulated the evolution of these important regulatory genes in a more recent time scale. Results show that most genes are under the action of purifying selection and present a level and pattern of polymorphism consistent with predictions of the neutral model, the exceptions being Su(z)12 and Pho. MK tests indicate an accumulation of adaptive changes in the SU(Z)12 protein during the divergence of D. subobscura and D. guanche. In contrast, the HKA test shows a deficit of polymorphism at Pho. The most likely explanation for this reduced variation is the location of this gene in the dot-like chromosome and would indicate that this chromosome also has null or very low recombination in D. subobscura, as reported in D. melanogaster.",2017,"Juan M Calvo-Martín, Montserrat Papaceit, Carmen Segarra, Juan M Calvo-Martín, Montserrat Papaceit, Carmen Segarra"
Neuronal cell fate specification by the molecular convergence of different spatio-temporal cues on a common initiator terminal selector gene,28414802,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006729,"The extensive genetic regulatory flows underlying specification of different neuronal subtypes are not well understood at the molecular level. The Nplp1 neuropeptide neurons in the developing Drosophila nerve cord belong to two sub-classes; Tv1 and dAp neurons, generated by two distinct progenitors. Nplp1 neurons are specified by spatial cues; the Hox homeotic network and GATA factor grn, and temporal cues; the hb -> Kr -> Pdm -> cas -> grh temporal cascade. These spatio-temporal cues combine into two distinct codes; one for Tv1 and one for dAp neurons that activate a common terminal selector feedforward cascade of col -> ap/eya -> dimm -> Nplp1. Here, we molecularly decode the specification of Nplp1 neurons, and find that the cis-regulatory organization of col functions as an integratory node for the different spatio-temporal combinatorial codes.

The Toll pathway underlies host sexual dimorphism in resistance to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in mated Drosophila,29268741,10.1186/s12915-017-0466-3,"Background:
        
      
      Host sexual dimorphism is being increasingly recognized to generate strong differences in the outcome of infectious disease, but the mechanisms underlying immunological differences between males and females remain poorly characterized. Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to assess and dissect sexual dimorphism in the innate response to systemic bacterial infection.
    


          Results:
        
      
      We demonstrated sexual dimorphism in susceptibility to infection by a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We found that both virgin and mated females are more susceptible than mated males to most, but not all, infections. We investigated in more detail the lower resistance of females to infection with Providencia rettgeri, a Gram-negative bacterium that naturally infects D. melanogaster. We found that females have a higher number of phagocytes than males and that ablation of hemocytes does not eliminate the dimorphism in resistance to P. rettgeri, so the observed dimorphism does not stem from differences in the cellular response. The Imd pathway is critical for the production of antimicrobial peptides in response to Gram-negative bacteria, but mutants for Imd signaling continued to exhibit dimorphism even though both sexes showed strongly reduced resistance. Instead, we found that the Toll pathway is responsible for the dimorphism in resistance. The Toll pathway is dimorphic in genome-wide constitutive gene expression and in induced response to infection. Toll signaling is dimorphic in both constitutive signaling and in induced activation in response to P. rettgeri infection. The dimorphism in pathway activation can be specifically attributed to Persephone-mediated immune stimulation, by which the Toll pathway is triggered in response to pathogen-derived virulence factors. We additionally found that, in absence of Toll signaling, males become more susceptible than females to the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. This reversal in susceptibility between male and female Toll pathway mutants compared to wildtype hosts highlights the key role of the Toll pathway in D. melanogaster sexual dimorphism in resistance to infection.
    


          Conclusion:

"Modulation of neuronal activity in the Drosophila mushroom body by DopEcR, a unique dual receptor for ecdysone and dopamine",28554773,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2017.05.015,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for steroid hormones mediate unconventional steroid signaling and play a significant role in the rapid actions of steroids in a variety of biological processes, including those in the nervous system. However, the effects of these GPCRs on overall neuronal activity remain largely elusive. Drosophila DopEcR is a GPCR that responds to both ecdysone (the major steroid hormone in insects) and dopamine, regulating multiple second messenger systems. Recent studies have revealed that DopEcR is preferentially expressed in the nervous system and involved in behavioral regulation. Here we utilized the bioluminescent Ca2+-indicator GFP-aequorin to monitor the nicotine-induced Ca2+-response within the mushroom bodies (MB), a higher-order brain center in flies, and examined how DopEcR modulates these Ca2+-dynamics. Our results show that in DopEcR knockdown flies, the nicotine-induced Ca2+-response in the MB was significantly enhanced selectively in the medial lobes. We then reveal that application of DopEcR's ligands, ecdysone and dopamine, had different effects on nicotine-induced Ca2+-responses in the MB: ecdysone enhanced activity in the calyx and cell body region in a DopEcR-dependent manner, whereas dopamine reduced activity in the medial lobes independently of DopEcR. Finally, we show that flies with reduced DopEcR function in the MB display decreased locomotor activity. This behavioral phenotype of DopEcR-deficient flies may be partly due to their enhanced MB activity, since the MB have been implicated in the suppression of locomotor activity. Overall, these data suggest that DopEcR is involved in region-specific modulation of Ca2+ dynamics within the MB, which may play a role in behavioral modulation.",2017,"Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Jean-René Martin, Arianna Lark, Toshihiro Kitamoto, Jean-René Martin"

All traits (wing length, wing width, thorax length, wing loading and wing aspect) showed significant variation for each environmental factor considered in both Drosophila species. The phenotypic plasticity pattern observed for each trait was different within and between these cactophilic Drosophila species depending on the environmental factor analyzed suggesting that body size-related traits respond almost independently to environmental heterogeneity.

The Brahma-associated protein (BAP) complex has been reported to serve as a Yki-binding cofactor to support Yki target expression. However, we observed that depletion of BAP leads to ectopic expression of Yki targets both autonomously and non-autonomously, suggesting additional indirect effects.

Mechanical Control of Whole Body Shape by a Single Cuticular Protein Obstructor-E in Drosophila melanogaster,28076349,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006548,"Body shapes are much more variable than body plans. One way to alter body shapes independently of body plans would be to mechanically deform bodies. To what extent body shapes are regulated physically, or molecules involved in physical control of morphogenesis, remain elusive. During fly metamorphosis, the cuticle (exoskeleton) covering the larval body contracts longitudinally and expands laterally to become the ellipsoidal pupal case (puparium). Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster Obstructor-E (Obst-E) is a protein constituent of the larval cuticle that confers the oriented contractility/expandability. In the absence of obst-E function, the larval cuticle fails to undergo metamorphic shape change and finally becomes a twiggy puparium. We present results indicating that Obst-E regulates the arrangement of chitin, a long-chain polysaccharide and a central component of the insect cuticle, and directs the formation of supracellular ridges on the larval cuticle. We further show that Obst-E is locally required for the oriented shape change of the cuticle during metamorphosis, which is associated with changes in the morphology of those ridges. Thus, Obst-E dramatically affects the body shape in a direct, physical manner by controlling the mechanical property of the exoskeleton.",2017,"Reiko Tajiri, Nobuhiro Ogawa, Haruhiko Fujiwara, Tetsuya Kojima, Reiko Tajiri, Nobuhiro Ogawa, Haruhiko Fujiwara, Tetsuya Kojima"
"Behavioral Changes and Survival in Drosophila melanogaster: Effects of Ascorbic Acid, Taurine, and Caffeine",29093334,10.1248/bpb.b17-00321,"In this study, we used Drosophila as a model species to examine the effects of vitamin or energy-drink and theses ingredients on behavioral activity, life-span, and survivorship. Behavioral assays were performed to analyze total activity during the subjective daytime and nighttime and the lifespan assay was performed to investigate the influence of the drink ingredients. Quantitative RT-PCR and enzyme activity analyses were applied to analyze the mutual relationship of neural pathways and anti-oxidant activities. Caffeine and taurine treatments resulted in significant differences between the control and ascorbic acid groups with respect to subjective daytime and nighttime activity (p<0.05). Additionally, the lifespan and survival on individual flies significantly decreased with 1.6% taurine, and 0.025 and 0.05% caffeine treatment compared to the normal group (p<0.05). These results are related to the transcript levels of neuromodulator (p<0.05). In addition, ascorbic acid treatments significantly increased the activity of antioxidant-related enzymes (p<0.05). We successfully demonstrated that 0.5 and 1.0% ascorbic acid increases the lifespan of fruit flies to a greater extent than 1.6% taurine, and 0.025 and 0.05% caffeine, and that this effect is driven by changes in gene expression and the activity of oxidative stress-related enzyme.

Geometry can provide long-range mechanical guidance for embryogenesis,28346461,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005443,"Downstream of gene expression, effectors such as the actomyosin contractile machinery drive embryo morphogenesis. During Drosophila embryonic axis extension, actomyosin has a specific planar-polarised organisation, which is responsible for oriented cell intercalation. In addition to these cell rearrangements, cell shape changes also contribute to tissue deformation. While cell-autonomous dynamics are well described, understanding the tissue-scale behaviour challenges us to solve the corresponding mechanical problem at the scale of the whole embryo, since mechanical resistance of all neighbouring epithelia will feedback on individual cells. Here we propose a novel numerical approach to compute the whole-embryo dynamics of the actomyosin-rich apical epithelial surface. We input in the model specific patterns of actomyosin contractility, such as the planar-polarisation of actomyosin in defined ventro-lateral regions of the embryo. Tissue strain rates and displacements are then predicted over the whole embryo surface according to the global balance of stresses and the material behaviour of the epithelium. Epithelia are modelled using a rheological law that relates the rate of deformation to the local stresses and actomyosin anisotropic contractility. Predicted flow patterns are consistent with the cell flows observed when imaging Drosophila axis extension in toto, using light sheet microscopy. The agreement between model and experimental data indicates that the anisotropic contractility of planar-polarised actomyosin in the ventro-lateral germband tissue can directly cause the tissue-scale deformations of the whole embryo. The three-dimensional mechanical balance is dependent on the geometry of the embryo, whose curved surface is taken into account in the simulations. Importantly, we find that to reproduce experimental flows, the model requires the presence of the cephalic furrow, a fold located anteriorly of the extending tissues. The presence of this geometric feature, through the global mechanical balance, guides the flow and orients extension towards the posterior end.",2017,"Mahamar Dicko, Pierre Saramito, Guy B Blanchard, Claire M Lye, Bénédicte Sanson, Jocelyn Étienne, Mahamar Dicko, Pierre Saramito, Guy B Blanchard, Claire M Lye, Bénédicte Sanson, Jocelyn Étienne"

Here we compare pheromone-processing pathways in D. melanogaster and D. simulans males to define how these sister species endow 7,11-heptacosadiene with the opposite behavioural valence to underlie species discrimination. We show that males of both species detect 7,11-heptacosadiene using homologous peripheral sensory neurons, but this signal is differentially propagated to P1 neurons, which control courtship behaviour. A change in the balance of excitation and inhibition onto courtship-promoting neurons transforms an excitatory pheromonal cue in D. melanogaster into an inhibitory cue in D. simulans.

RhoGAPp190: A potential player in tbph-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila,29652933,10.1371/journal.pone.0195845,"TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, Drosophila melanogaster is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein in vivo. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3'-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of Drosophila RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing.

Adipokinetic hormone and adenosine interfere with nematobacterial infection and locomotion in Drosophila melanogaster,29627353,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.04.002,"This study examined how adipokinetic hormone (AKH) and adenosine affect defense responses in Drosophila melanogaster larvae infected with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN, Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora). Three loss-of-function mutant larvae were tested: Akh1, AdoR1 (adenosine receptor), and Akh1 AdoR1. Mortality decreased in all mutants post-EPN infection compared with the control (w1118). Additionally, co-application of external AKH with EPN significantly increased mortality beyond rates observed in EPN-only treatment, while also elevating carbon dioxide production, a measure of metabolism. Furthermore trehalose levels increased in both w1118 and Akh1 larvae post-EPN infection, but the latter group exhibited a lower increase and total trehalose levels. Interestingly, baseline trehalose was relatively high in untreated AdoR1 and Akh1 AdoR1 mutants, with levels remaining unaffected by infection. Infection also elevated haemolymph lipid content overall, but the different mutations did not substantially influence this change. In contrast, haemolymph protein content dropped after EPN infection in all tested groups, but this decline was more intense among Akh1. In uninfected larvae mutations decreased antioxidative capacity in Akh1 and increased in AdoR1, however, its post-infection increases were similar in all mutants, suggesting that antioxidant response in Drosophila involves mechanisms also beyond AKH and adenosine. Furthermore, AKH application in w1118 larvae significantly increased movement distance and percentage of larval activity, but reduced velocity.

An inversion supergene in Drosophila underpins latitudinal clines in survival traits,29904977,10.1111/jeb.13310,"Chromosomal inversions often contribute to local adaptation across latitudinal clines, but the underlying selective mechanisms remain poorly understood. We and others have previously shown that a clinal inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster, In(3R)Payne, underpins body size clines along the North American and Australian east coasts. Here, we ask whether this polymorphism also contributes to clinal variation in other fitness-related traits, namely survival traits (lifespan, survival upon starvation and survival upon cold shock). We generated homokaryon lines, either carrying the inverted or standard chromosomal arrangement, isolated from populations approximating the endpoints of the North American cline (Florida, Maine) and phenotyped the flies at two growth temperatures (18 °C, 25 °C). Across both temperatures, high-latitude flies from Maine lived longer and were more stress resistant than low-latitude flies from Florida, as previously observed. Interestingly, we find that this latitudinal pattern is partly explained by the clinal distribution of the In(3R)P polymorphism, which is at ~ 50% frequency in Florida but absent in Maine: inverted karyotypes tended to be shorter-lived and less stress resistant than uninverted karyotypes. We also detected an interaction between karyotype and temperature on survival traits. As In(3R)P influences body size and multiple survival traits, it can be viewed as a 'supergene', a cluster of tightly linked loci affecting multiple complex phenotypes. We conjecture that the inversion cline is maintained by fitness trade-offs and balancing selection across geography; elucidating the mechanisms whereby this inversion affects alternative, locally adapted phenotypes across the cline is an important task for future work.",2018,"Esra Durmaz, Clare Benson, Martin Kapun, Paul Schmidt, Thomas Flatt, Esra Durmaz, Clare Benson, Martin Kapun, Paul Schmidt, Thomas Flatt"
A Targeted RNAi Screen Reveals Drosophila Female-Sterile Genes That Control the Size of Germline Stem Cell Niche During Development,29764959,10.1534/g3.118.200355,"Adult stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis. This unique capability largely depends on the stem cell niche, a specialized microenvironment, which preserves stem cell identity through physical contacts and secreted factors. In many cancers, latent tumor cell niches are thought to house stem cells and aid tumor initiation. However, in developing tissue and cancer it is unclear how the niche is established. The well-characterized germline stem cells (GSCs) and niches in the Drosophila melanogaster ovary provide an excellent model to address this fundamental issue. As such, we conducted a small-scale RNAi screen of 560 individually expressed UAS-RNAi lines with targets implicated in female fertility. RNAi was expressed in the soma of larval gonads, and screening for reduced egg production and abnormal ovarian morphology was performed in adults. Twenty candidates that affect ovarian development were identified and subsequently knocked down in the soma only during niche formation.

Our goal was to study chemical insect attractants produced by yeasts that span more than 250 million years of evolutionary history and vastly differ in their metabolism and lifestyle. We bioassayed attraction of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster to odors of phylogenetically and ecologically distinct yeasts grown under controlled conditions. Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the insect-associated species Candida californica, Pichia kluyveri and Metschnikowia andauensis, wine yeast Dekkera bruxellensis, milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, the vertebrate pathogens Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and oleophilic Yarrowia lipolytica were screened for fly attraction in a wind tunnel. Yeast headspace was chemically analyzed, and co-occurrence of insect attractants in yeasts and flowering plants was investigated through a database search. In yeasts with known genomes, we investigated the occurrence of genes involved in the synthesis of key aroma compounds. Flies were attracted to all nine yeasts studied. The behavioral response to baker's yeast was independent of its growth stage. In addition to Drosophila, we tested the basal hexapod Folsomia candida (Collembola) in a Y-tube assay to the most ancient yeast, Y. lipolytica, which proved that early yeast signals also function on clades older than neopteran insects. Behavioral and chemical data and a search for selected genes of volatile metabolites underline that biosynthesis of chemical signals is found throughout the yeast clade and has been conserved during the evolution of yeast lifestyles. Literature and database reviews corroborate that yeast signals mediate mutualistic interactions between insects and yeasts. Moreover, volatiles emitted by yeasts are commonly found also in flowers and attract many insect species. The collective evidence suggests that the release of volatile signals by yeasts is a widespread and phylogenetically ancient trait, and that insect-yeast communication evolved prior to the emergence of flowering plants. Co-occurrence of the same attractant signals in yeast and flowers suggests that yeast-insect communication may have contributed to the evolution of insect-mediated pollination in flowers.",2018,"Paul G Becher, Arne Hagman, Vasiliki Verschut, Amrita Chakraborty, Elżbieta Rozpędowska, Sébastien Lebreton, Marie Bengtsson, Gerhard Flick, Peter Witzgall, Jure Piškur, Paul G Becher, Arne Hagman, Vasiliki Verschut, Amrita Chakraborty, Elżbieta Rozpędowska, Sébastien Lebreton, Marie Bengtsson, Gerhard Flick, Peter Witzgall, Jure Piškur"
Overexpression of histone methyltransferase NSD in Drosophila induces apoptotic cell death via the Jun-N-terminal kinase pathway,29410178,10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.01.156,"The nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein gene (NSD) family encodes a group of highly conserved SET domain-containing histone lysine methyltransferases that are important in multiple aspects of development in various organisms. The association of NSD1 duplications has been reported with growth retardation diseases in humans. In this study, to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which the overexpression of NSD1 influences the disease progression, we analyzed the gain-of-function mutant phenotypes of the Drosophila NSD using the GAL4/UAS system. Ubiquitous overexpression of NSD in the fly caused developmental delay and reduced body size at the larval stage, resulting in pupal lethality. Moreover, targeted overexpression in various developing tissues led to significant phenotype alterations, and the gain-of-function phenotypes were rescued by NSD RNAi knockdown. We also demonstrated that NSD overexpression not only enhanced the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes but also activated caspase. The atrophied phenotype of NSD-overexpressing wing was strongly suppressed by a loss-of-function mutation in hemipterous, which encodes a Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase. Taken together, our findings suggest that NSD induces apoptosis via the activation of JNK, and thus contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in NSD1-related diseases in humans.",2018,"Yuji Jeong, Taejoon Kim, Suyeun Kim, Yoon-Ki Hong, Kyoung Sang Cho, Im-Soon Lee, Yuji Jeong, Taejoon Kim, Suyeun Kim, Yoon-Ki Hong, Kyoung Sang Cho, Im-Soon Lee"
Sex-specific phenotypes of histone H4 point mutants establish dosage compensation as the critical function of H4K16 acetylation in Drosophila,30530664,10.1073/pnas.1817274115,"Acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16) modulates nucleosome-nucleosome interactions and directly affects nucleosome binding by certain proteins. In Drosophila, H4K16 acetylation by the dosage compensation complex subunit Mof is linked to increased transcription of genes on the single X chromosome in males. Here, we analyzed Drosophila containing different H4K16 mutations or lacking Mof protein. An H4K16A mutation causes embryonic lethality in both sexes, whereas an H4K16R mutation permits females to develop into adults but causes lethality in males. The acetyl-mimic mutation H4K16Q permits both females and males to develop into adults. Complementary analyses reveal that males lacking maternally deposited and zygotically expressed Mof protein arrest development during gastrulation, whereas females of the same genotype develop into adults. Together, this demonstrates the causative role of H4K16 acetylation by Mof for dosage compensation in Drosophila and uncovers a previously unrecognized requirement for this process already during the onset of zygotic gene transcription.",2018,"Ömer Copur, Andrey Gorchakov, Katja Finkl, Mitzi I Kuroda, Jürg Müller, Ömer Copur, Andrey Gorchakov, Katja Finkl, Mitzi I Kuroda, Jürg Müller"
Diverse Spatial Expression Patterns Emerge from Unified Kinetics of Transcriptional Bursting,30340044,10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.056,"How transcriptional bursting relates to gene regulation is a central question that has persisted for more than a decade. Here, we measure nascent transcriptional activity in early Drosophila embryos and characterize the variability in absolute activity levels across expression boundaries. We demonstrate that boundary formation follows a common transcription principle: a single control parameter determines the distribution of transcriptional activity, regardless of gene identity, boundary position, or enhancer-promoter architecture. We infer the underlying bursting kinetics and identify the key regulatory parameter as the fraction of time a gene is in a transcriptionally active state. Unexpectedly, both the rate of polymerase initiation and the switching rates are tightly constrained across all expression levels, predicting synchronous patterning outcomes at all positions in the embryo. These results point to a shared simplicity underlying the apparently complex transcriptional processes of early embryonic patterning and indicate a path to general rules in transcriptional regulation.",2018,"Benjamin Zoller, Shawn C Little, Thomas Gregor, Benjamin Zoller, Shawn C Little, Thomas Gregor"
An expanded toolkit for gene tagging based on MiMIC and scarless CRISPR tagging in Drosophila,30091705,10.7554/eLife.38709,"We generated two new genetic tools to efficiently tag genes in Drosophila. The first, Double Header (DH) utilizes intronic MiMIC/CRIMIC insertions to generate artificial exons for GFP mediated protein trapping or T2A-GAL4 gene trapping in vivo based on Cre recombinase to avoid embryo injections. DH significantly increases integration efficiency compared to previous strategies and faithfully reports the expression pattern of genes and proteins. The second technique targets genes lacking coding introns using a two-step cassette exchange. First, we replace the endogenous gene with an excisable compact dominant marker using CRISPR making a null allele. Second, the insertion is replaced with a protein::tag cassette. This sequential manipulation allows the generation of numerous tagged alleles or insertion of other DNA fragments that facilitates multiple downstream applications. Both techniques allow precise gene manipulation and facilitate detection of gene expression, protein localization and assessment of protein function, as well as numerous other applications.",2018,"David Li-Kroeger, Oguz Kanca, Pei-Tseng Lee, Sierra Cowan, Michael T Lee, Manish Jaiswal, Jose Luis Salazar, Yuchun He, Zhongyuan Zuo, Hugo J Bellen, David Li-Kroeger, Oguz Kanca, Pei-Tseng Lee, Sierra Cowan, Michael T Lee, Manish Jaiswal, Jose Luis Salazar, Yuchun He, Zhongyuan Zuo, Hugo J Bellen"

The small molecule, 2H-4-Ru, binds to r(CUG)exp and converts guanosine residues to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine upon photochemical irradiation. We demonstrate targeted modification upon irradiation in cell culture and in Drosophila larvae provided a diet containing 2H-4-Ru.

Parallel clinal variation in the mid-day siesta of Drosophila melanogaster implicates continent-specific targets of natural selection,30180162,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007612,"Similar to many diurnal animals, Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a mid-day siesta that is more robust as ambient temperature rises, an adaptive response aimed at minimizing exposure to heat. Mid-day siesta levels are partly regulated by the thermosensitive splicing of a small intron (termed dmpi8) found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the circadian clock gene period (per). Using the well-studied D. melanogaster latitudinal cline along the eastern coast of Australia, we show that flies from temperate populations sleep less during the day compared to those from tropical regions. We identified combinations of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' UTR of per that yield several different haplotypes. The two most abundant of these haplotypes exhibit a reciprocal tropical-temperate distribution in relative frequency. Intriguingly, transgenic flies with the major tropical isoform manifest increased daytime sleep and reduced dmpi8 splicing compared to those carrying the temperate variant. Our results strongly suggest that for a major portion of D. melanogaster in Australia, thermal adaptation of daily sleep behavior included spatially varying selection on ancestrally derived polymorphisms in the per 3' UTR that differentially control dmpi8 splicing efficiency. Prior work showed that African flies from high altitudes manifest reduced mid-day siesta levels, indicative of parallel latitudinal and altitudinal adaptation across continents. However, geographical variation in per 3' UTR haplotypes was not observed for African flies, providing a compelling case for inter-continental variation in factors targeted by natural selection in attaining a parallel adaptation. We propose that the ability to calibrate mid-day siesta levels to better match local temperature ranges is a key adaptation contributing to the successful colonization of D. melanogaster beyond its ancestral range in the lowlands of Sub-Saharan Africa.",2018,"Yong Yang, Isaac Edery, Yong Yang, Isaac Edery"

The impact of SPARC on age-related cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis in Drosophila,29032244,10.1016/j.exger.2017.10.011,"Tissue fibrosis, an accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen, accompanies cardiac ageing in humans and this is linked to an increased risk of cardiac failure. The mechanisms driving age-related tissue fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction are unclear, yet clinically important. Drosophila is amenable to the study of cardiac ageing as well as collagen deposition; however it is unclear whether collagen accumulates in the ageing Drosophila heart. This work examined collagen deposition and cardiac function in ageing Drosophila, in the context of reduced expression of collagen-interacting protein SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) an evolutionarily conserved protein linked with fibrosis. Heart function was measured using high frame rate videomicroscopy. Collagen deposition was monitored using a fluorescently-tagged collagen IV reporter (encoded by the Viking gene) and staining of the cardiac collagen, Pericardin. The Drosophila heart accumulated collagen IV and Pericardin as flies aged. Associated with this was a decline in cardiac function. SPARC heterozygous flies lived longer than controls and showed little to no age-related cardiac dysfunction. As flies of both genotypes aged, cardiac levels of collagen IV (Viking) and Pericardin increased similarly. Over-expression of SPARC caused cardiomyopathy and increased Pericardin deposition. The findings demonstrate that, like humans, the Drosophila heart develops a fibrosis-like phenotype as it ages. Although having no gross impact on collagen accumulation, reduced SPARC expression extended Drosophila lifespan and cardiac health span. It is proposed that cardiac fibrosis in humans may develop due to the activation of conserved mechanisms and that SPARC may mediate cardiac ageing by mechanisms more subtle than gross accumulation of collagen.",2018,"Leigh Vaughan, Richard Marley, Sara Miellet, Paul S Hartley, Leigh Vaughan, Richard Marley, Sara Miellet, Paul S Hartley"
Drosophila tsRNAs preferentially suppress general translation machinery via antisense pairing and participate in cellular starvation response,29548011,10.1093/nar/gky189,"Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) are an emerging class of small RNAs, yet their regulatory roles have not been well understood. Here we studied the molecular mechanisms and consequences of tsRNA-mediated regulation in Drosophila. By analyzing 495 public small RNA libraries, we demonstrate that most tsRNAs are conserved, prevalent and abundant in Drosophila. By carrying out mRNA sequencing and ribosome profiling of S2 cells transfected with single-stranded tsRNA mimics and mocks, we show that tsRNAs recognize target mRNAs through conserved complementary sequence matching and suppress target genes by translational inhibition. The target prediction suggests that tsRNAs preferentially suppress translation of the key components of the general translation machinery, which explains how tsRNAs inhibit the global mRNA translation. Serum starvation experiments confirm tsRNAs participate in cellular starvation responses by preferential targeting the ribosomal proteins and translational initiation or elongation factors. Knock-down of AGO2 in S2 cells under normal and starved conditions reveals a dependence of the tsRNA-mediated regulation on AGO2. We also validated the repressive effects of representative tsRNAs on cellular global translation and specific targets with luciferase reporter assays. Our study suggests the tsRNA-mediated regulation might be crucial for the energy homeostasis and the metabolic adaptation in the cellular systems.",2018,"Shiqi Luo, Feng He, Junjie Luo, Shengqian Dou, Yirong Wang, Annan Guo, Jian Lu, Shiqi Luo, Feng He, Junjie Luo, Shengqian Dou, Yirong Wang, Annan Guo, Jian Lu"

Multiple examples implicate differential activity of p53 in cell competition in mammals, but p53 has not been found to have the same role in Drosophila, where the phenomenon of cell competition was first recognized. Recent studies now show that Drosophila cells harboring mutations in Ribosomal protein (Rp) genes, which are eliminated by cell competition with wild type cells, activate a p53 target gene, Xrp1. In Diamond Blackfan Anemia, human Rp mutants activate p53 itself, through a nucleolar stress pathway.

Differentiation of follicular epithelium in polytrophic ovaries of Pieris napi (Lepidoptera: Pieridae)-how far to Drosophila model,31134405,10.1007/s00709-019-01391-1,"Lepidoptera together with its sister group Trichoptera belongs to the superorder Amphiesmenoptera, which is closely related to the Antliophora, comprising Diptera, Siphonaptera, and Mecoptera. In the lepidopteran Pieris napi, a representative of the family Pieridae, the ovaries typical of butterflies are polytrophic and consist of structural ovarian units termed ovarioles. Each ovariole is composed of a terminal filament, germarium, vitellarium, and ovariole stalk. The germarium houses developing germ cell clusters and somatic prefollicular and follicular cells. The significantly elongated vitellarium contains linearly arranged ovarian follicles in successive stages of oogenesis (previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, and choriogenesis). Each follicle consists of an oocyte and seven nurse cells surrounded by follicular epithelium. During oogenesis, follicular cells diversify into five morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulations: (1) main body follicular cells (mbFC), (2) stretched cells (stFC), (3) posterior terminal cells (pFC), (4) centripetal cells (cpFC), and (5) interfollicular stalk cells (IFS). Centripetal cells are migratorily active and finally form the micropyle. Interfollicular stalk cells derive from mbFC as a result of mbFC intercalation.

The microbiota of Drosophila suzukii influences the larval development of Drosophila melanogaster,31763075,10.7717/peerj.8097,"Microorganisms play a central role in the biology of vinegar flies such as Drosophila suzukii and Drosophila melanogaster: serving as a food source to both adults and larvae, and influencing a range of traits including nutrition, behavior, and development. The niches utilized by the fly species partially overlap, as do the microbiota that sustain them, and interactions among these players may drive the development of crop diseases. To learn more about how the microbiota of one species may affect the other, we isolated and identified microbes from field-caught D. suzukii, and then characterized their effects on D. melanogaster larval development time in the laboratory. We found that the D. suzukii microbiota consistently included both yeasts and bacteria. It was dominated by yeasts of the genus Hanseniaspora, and bacteria from the families Acetobacteraceae and Enterobacteriaceae. Raising D. melanogaster under gnotobiotic conditions with each microbial isolate individually, we found that some bacteria promoted larval development relative to axenic conditions, but most did not have a significant effect. In contrast, nearly all the yeasts tested significantly accelerated larval development. The one exception was Starmerella bacillaris, which had the opposite effect: significantly slowing larval developmental rate. We investigated the basis for this effect by examining whether S. bacillaris cells could sustain larval growth, and measuring the survival of S. bacillaris and other yeasts in the larval gut. Our results suggest S. bacillaris is not digested by D. melanogaster and therefore cannot serve as a source of nutrition. These findings have interesting implications for possible interactions between the two Drosophilia species and their microbiota in nature. Overall, we found that microbes isolated from D. suzukii promote D. melanogaster larval development, which is consistent with the model that infestation of fruit by D. suzukii can open up habitat for D. melanogaster. We propose that the microbiome is an important dimension of the ecological interactions between Drosophila species.",2019,"Gabrielle M Solomon, Hiruni Dodangoda, Tylea McCarthy-Walker, Rita Ntim-Gyakari, Peter D Newell, Gabrielle M Solomon, Hiruni Dodangoda, Tylea McCarthy-Walker, Rita Ntim-Gyakari, Peter D Newell"
Live applications of norbormide-based fluorescent probes in Drosophila melanogaster,30958824,10.1371/journal.pone.0211169,"In this study we investigated the performance of two norbormide (NRB)-derived fluorescent probes, NRBMC009 (green) and NRBZLW0047 (red), on dissected, living larvae of Drosophila, to verify their potential application in live cell imaging confocal microscopy.

Both probes were rapidly internalized by most tissues (except the central nervous system) allowing each organ in the microscope field to be readily distinguished at low magnification. At the cellular level, the probes showed a very similar distribution (except for fat bodies), defined by loss of signal in the nucleus and plasma membrane, and a preferential localization to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. They also recognized ER and mitochondrial phenotypes in the skeletal muscles of fruit fly models that had loss of function mutations in the atlastin and mitofusin genes, suggesting NRBMC009 and NRBZLW0047 as potentially useful screening tools for characterizing ER and mitochondria morphological alterations. Feeding of larvae and adult Drosophilae with the NRB-derived dyes led to staining of the gut and its epithelial cells, revealing a potential role in food intake assays. In addition, when flies were exposed to either dye over their entire life cycle no apparent functional or morphological abnormalities were detected.

Genetic and Molecular Analysis of Essential Genes in Centromeric Heterochromatin of the Left Arm of Chromosome 3 in Drosophila melanogaster,30948422,10.1534/g3.119.0003,"A large portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome is contained within heterochromatic regions of chromosomes, predominantly at centromeres and telomeres.

When lipid proportion was examined, we observed higher levels in flies fed the high protein diet with stearic acid diet and the high carbohydrate diet.

Accurate Allele Frequencies from Ultra-low Coverage Pool-Seq Samples in Evolve-and-Resequence Experiments,31636085,10.1534/g3.119.400755,"Evolve-and-resequence (E+R) experiments leverage next-generation sequencing technology to track the allele frequency dynamics of populations as they evolve. While previous work has shown that adaptive alleles can be detected by comparing frequency trajectories from many replicate populations, this power comes at the expense of high-coverage (>100x) sequencing of many pooled samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. Here, we show that accurate estimates of allele frequencies can be achieved with very shallow sequencing depths (<5x) via inference of known founder haplotypes in small genomic windows. This technique can be used to efficiently estimate frequencies for any number of bi-allelic SNPs in populations of any model organism founded with sequenced homozygous strains. Using both experimentally-pooled and simulated samples of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that haplotype inference can improve allele frequency accuracy by orders of magnitude for up to 50 generations of recombination, and is robust to moderate levels of missing data, as well as different selection regimes. Finally, we show that a simple linear model generated from these simulations can predict the accuracy of haplotype-derived allele frequencies in other model organisms and experimental designs. To make these results broadly accessible for use in E+R experiments, we introduce HAF-pipe, an open-source software tool for calculating haplotype-derived allele frequencies from raw sequencing data. Ultimately, by reducing sequencing costs without sacrificing accuracy, our method facilitates E+R designs with higher replication and resolution, and thereby, increased power to detect adaptive alleles.",2019,"Susanne Tilk, Alan Bergland, Aaron Goodman, Paul Schmidt, Dmitri Petrov, Sharon Greenblum, Susanne Tilk, Alan Bergland, Aaron Goodman, Paul Schmidt, Dmitri Petrov, Sharon Greenblum"
The novel gene apnoia regulates Drosophila tracheal tube size,30892787,10.1002/dvdy.29,"Background:
        
      
      Distinct tube size is critical for the function of human tubular organs such as the lung, vascular system, and kidney. Aberrant tube sizes can lead to devastating human illnesses, including polycystic kidney disease. The Drosophila trachea provides a premier genetic system to investigate the fundamental mechanisms that regulate tube size.
    


          Results:
        
      
      Here we describe the function of a novel gene, apnoia, in tube-size regulation. apn encodes an apical membrane protein, Apnoia (Apn), with three helical transmembrane domains. Loss-of-function apn mutants show shorter-tube and air-filling defects in larval trachea, whereas there are no obvious defects in embryonic trachea. Conversely, overexpression of apn in trachea leads to significant tube over-elongation. We analyzed apical luminal matrix and cell polarity in these longer tubes. It is interesting to note that we observed normal establishment of cell polarity, whereas all luminal matrix components are significantly reduced. In addition, we observed that some matrix components are localized in cytoplasmic vesicles, suggesting secretion defects in apn overexpressing trachea.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      Taken together, these results strongly suggest the possibility that apn is directly or indirectly involved in vesicular trafficking to regulate tube size.",2019,"Aaron Scholl, Michael J O'Brien, Rachana R Chandran, Lan Jiang, Aaron Scholl, Michael J O'Brien, Rachana R Chandran, Lan Jiang"
Computational identification of tissue-specific transcription factor cooperation in ten cattle tissues,31095599,10.1371/journal.pone.0216475,"Transcription factors (TFs) are a special class of DNA-binding proteins that orchestrate gene transcription by recruiting other TFs, co-activators or co-repressors. Their combinatorial interplay in higher organisms maintains homeostasis and governs cell identity by finely controlling and regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Despite the rich literature on the importance of cooperative TFs for deciphering the mechanisms of individual regulatory programs that control tissue specificity in several organisms such as human, mouse, or Drosophila melanogaster, to date, there is still need for a comprehensive study to detect specific TF cooperations in regulatory processes of cattle tissues. To address the needs of knowledge about specific combinatorial gene regulation in cattle tissues, we made use of three publicly available RNA-seq datasets and obtained tissue-specific gene (TSG) sets for ten tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, duodenum, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, colon, spleen and testis). By analyzing these TSG-sets, tissue-specific TF cooperations of each tissue have been identified. The results reveal that similar to the combinatorial regulatory events of model organisms, TFs change their partners depending on their biological functions in different tissues. Particularly with regard to preferential partner choice of the transcription factors STAT3 and NR2C2, this phenomenon has been highlighted with their five different specific cooperation partners in multiple tissues. The information about cooperative TFs could be promising: i) to understand the molecular mechanisms of regulating processes; and ii) to extend the existing knowledge on the importance of single TFs in cattle tissues.",2019,"Lukas Steuernagel, Cornelia Meckbach, Felix Heinrich, Sebastian Zeidler, Armin O Schmitt, Mehmet Gültas, Lukas Steuernagel, Cornelia Meckbach, Felix Heinrich, Sebastian Zeidler, Armin O Schmitt, Mehmet Gültas"
Amplification of Drosophila Olfactory Responses by a DEG/ENaC Channel,31629603,10.1016/j.neuron.2019.08.041,"Insect olfactory receptors operate as ligand-gated ion channels that directly transduce odor stimuli into electrical signals. However, in the absence of any known intermediate transduction steps, it remains unclear whether and how these ionotropic inputs are amplified in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Here, we find that amplification occurs in the Drosophila courtship-promoting ORNs through Pickpocket 25 (PPK25), a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family (DEG/ENaC). Pharmacological and genetic manipulations indicate that, in Or47b and Ir84a ORNs, PPK25 mediates Ca2+-dependent signal amplification via an intracellular calmodulin-binding motif. Additionally, hormonal signaling upregulates PPK25 expression to determine the degree of amplification, with striking effects on male courtship. Together, these findings advance our understanding of sensory neurobiology by identifying an amplification mechanism compatible with ionotropic signaling. Moreover, this study offers new insights into DEG/ENaC activation by highlighting a novel means of regulation that is likely conserved across species.",2019,"Renny Ng, Secilia S Salem, Shiuan-Tze Wu, Meilin Wu, Hui-Hao Lin, Andrew K Shepherd, William J Joiner, Jing W Wang, Chih-Ying Su, Renny Ng, Secilia S Salem, Shiuan-Tze Wu, Meilin Wu, Hui-Hao Lin, Andrew K Shepherd, William J Joiner, Jing W Wang, Chih-Ying Su"
Matrix metalloproteinase 1 modulates invasive behavior of tracheal branches during entry into Drosophila flight muscles,31577228,10.7554/eLife.48857,"Tubular networks like the vasculature extend branches throughout animal bodies, but how developing vessels interact with and invade tissues is not well understood. We investigated the underlying mechanisms using the developing tracheal tube network of Drosophila indirect flight muscles (IFMs) as a model. Live imaging revealed that tracheal sprouts invade IFMs directionally with growth-cone-like structures at branch tips. Ramification inside IFMs proceeds until tracheal branches fill the myotube. However, individual tracheal cells occupy largely separate territories, possibly mediated by cell-cell repulsion. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) is required in tracheal cells for normal invasion speed and for the dynamic organization of growth-cone-like branch tips. MMP1 remodels the CollagenIV-containing matrix around branch tips, which show differential matrix composition with low CollagenIV levels, while Laminin is present along tracheal branches. Thus, tracheal-derived MMP1 sustains branch invasion by modulating the dynamic behavior of sprouting branches as well as properties of the surrounding matrix.",2019,"Julia Sauerwald, Wilko Backer, Till Matzat, Frank Schnorrer, Stefan Luschnig, Julia Sauerwald, Wilko Backer, Till Matzat, Frank Schnorrer, Stefan Luschnig"
Cul3 and insomniac are required for rapid ubiquitination of postsynaptic targets and retrograde homeostatic signaling,31278365,10.1038/s41467-019-10992-6,"At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors activates retrograde signaling that precisely increases presynaptic neurotransmitter release to restore baseline synaptic strength. However, the nature of the underlying postsynaptic induction process remains enigmatic. Here, we design a forward genetic screen to discover factors in the postsynaptic compartment necessary to generate retrograde homeostatic signaling. This approach identified insomniac (inc), a putative adaptor for the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex, which together with Cul3 is essential for normal sleep regulation. Interestingly, we find that Inc and Cul3 rapidly accumulate at postsynaptic compartments following acute receptor inhibition and are required for a local increase in mono-ubiquitination. Finally, we show that Peflin, a Ca2+-regulated Cul3 co-adaptor, is necessary for homeostatic communication, suggesting a relationship between Ca2+ signaling and control of Cul3/Inc activity in the postsynaptic compartment. Our study suggests that Cul3/Inc-dependent mono-ubiquitination, compartmentalized at postsynaptic densities, gates retrograde signaling and provides an intriguing molecular link between the control of sleep and homeostatic plasticity at synapses.",2019,"Koto Kikuma, Xiling Li, Sarah Perry, Qiuling Li, Pragya Goel, Catherine Chen, Daniel Kim, Nicholas Stavropoulos, Dion Dickman, Koto Kikuma, Xiling Li, Sarah Perry, Qiuling Li, Pragya Goel, Catherine Chen, Daniel Kim, Nicholas Stavropoulos, Dion Dickman"
Inhibition of fatty acid desaturation impairs cuticle differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster,30672604,10.1002/arch.21535,"Previously, we showed that inhibition of the activity of fatty acid desaturases (Desat) perturbs signalling of the developmental timing hormone ecdysone in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. To understand the impact of this effect on cuticle differentiation, a process regulated by ecdysone, we analysed the cuticle of D. melanogaster larvae fed with the Desat inhibitor CA10556. In these larvae, the expression of most of the key cuticle genes is normal or slightly elevated at day one of CA10556 feeding. As an exception, expression of twdlM coding for a yet uncharacterised cuticle protein is completely suppressed. The cuticle of these larvae appears to be normal at the morphological level. However, these animals are sensitive to desiccation, a trait that according to our data, among others, may be associated with reduced TwdlM amounts. At day two of CA10556 feeding, expression of most of the cuticle genes tested including twdlM is suppressed. Expression of cpr47Eb coding for a chitin-binding protein is, by contrast, highly elevated suggesting that Cpr47Eb participates at a specific compensation program. Overall, the cuticle of these larvae is thinner than the cuticle of control larvae. Taken together, lipid desaturation is necessary for a coordinated deployment of a normal cuticle differentiation program.",2019,"Yiwen Wang, Annette Maier, Nicole Gehring, Bernard Moussian, Yiwen Wang, Annette Maier, Nicole Gehring, Bernard Moussian"
Multiple functions of DYRK2 in cancer and tissue development,31505048,10.1002/1873-3468.13601,"Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Accumulating studies have revealed that DYRKs have important roles in regulation of the cell cycle and survival. DYRK2, a member of the class II DYRK family protein, is a key regulator of p53, and phosphorylates it at Ser46 to induce apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Moreover, recent studies have uncovered that DYRK2 regulates G1/S transition, epithelial-mesenchymal-transition, and stemness in human cancer cells. DYRK2 also appears to have roles in tissue development in lower eukaryotes. Thus, the elucidation of mechanisms for DYRK2 during mammalian tissue development will promote the understanding of cell differentiation, tissue homeostasis, and congenital diseases as well as cancer.

Venom Atypical Extracellular Vesicles as Interspecies Vehicles of Virulence Factors Involved in Host Specificity: The Case of a Drosophila Parasitoid Wasp,31379874,10.3389/fimmu.2019.01688,"Endoparasitoid wasps, which lay eggs inside the bodies of other insects, use various strategies to protect their offspring from the host immune response. The hymenopteran species of the genus Leptopilina, parasites of Drosophila, rely on the injection of a venom which contains proteins and peculiar vesicles (hereafter venosomes). We show here that the injection of purified L. boulardi venosomes is sufficient to impair the function of the Drosophila melanogaster lamellocytes, a hemocyte type specialized in the defense against wasp eggs, and thus the parasitic success of the wasp. These venosomes seem to have a unique extracellular biogenesis in the wasp venom apparatus where they acquire specific secreted proteins/virulence factors and act as a transport system to deliver these compounds into host lamellocytes. The level of venosomes entry into lamellocytes of different Drosophila species was correlated with the rate of parasitism success of the wasp, suggesting that this venosome-cell interaction may represent a new evolutionary level of host-parasitoid specificity.",2019,"Bin Wan, Emilie Goguet, Marc Ravallec, Olivier Pierre, Séverine Lemauf, Anne-Nathalie Volkoff, Jean-Luc Gatti, Marylène Poirié, Bin Wan, Emilie Goguet, Marc Ravallec, Olivier Pierre, Séverine Lemauf, Anne-Nathalie Volkoff, Jean-Luc Gatti, Marylène Poirié"
Integrating Gene Expression Data Into Genomic Prediction,30858865,10.3389/fgene.2019.00126,"Gene expression profiles potentially hold valuable information for the prediction of breeding values and phenotypes. In this study, the utility of transcriptome data for phenotype prediction was tested with 185 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster for nine traits in two sexes. We incorporated the transcriptome data into genomic prediction via two methods: GTBLUP and GRBLUP, both combining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and transcriptome data. The genotypic data was used to construct the common additive genomic relationship, which was used in genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) or jointly in a linear mixed model with a transcriptome-based linear kernel (GTBLUP), or with a transcriptome-based Gaussian kernel (GRBLUP). We studied the predictive ability of the models and discuss a concept of ""omics-augmented broad sense heritability"" for the multi-omics era. For most traits, GRBLUP and GBLUP provided similar predictive abilities, but GRBLUP explained more of the phenotypic variance. There was only one trait (olfactory perception to Ethyl Butyrate in females) in which the predictive ability of GRBLUP (0.23) was significantly higher than the predictive ability of GBLUP (0.21). Our results suggest that accounting for transcriptome data has the potential to improve genomic predictions if transcriptome data can be included on a larger scale.",2019,"Zhengcao Li, Ning Gao, Johannes W R Martini, Henner Simianer, Zhengcao Li, Ning Gao, Johannes W R Martini, Henner Simianer"

Glycine-alanine dipeptide repeats spread rapidly in a repeat length- and age-dependent manner in the fly brain,31843021,10.1186/s40478-019-0860-x,"Hexanucleotide repeat expansions of variable size in C9orf72 are the most prevalent genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Sense and antisense transcripts of the expansions are translated by repeat-associated non-AUG translation into five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Of these, the polyGR, polyPR and, to a lesser extent, polyGA DPRs are neurotoxic, with polyGA the most abundantly detected DPR in patient tissue. Trans-cellular transmission of protein aggregates has recently emerged as a major driver of toxicity in various neurodegenerative diseases. In vitro evidence suggests that the C9 DPRs can spread. However, whether this phenomenon occurs under more complex in vivo conditions remains unexplored. Here, we used the adult fly brain to investigate whether the C9 DPRs can spread in vivo upon expression in a subset of neurons. We found that only polyGA can progressively spread throughout the brain, which accumulates in the shape of aggregate-like puncta inside recipient cells. Interestingly, GA transmission occurred as early as 3 days after expression induction. By comparing the spread of 36, 100 and 200 polyGA repeats, we found that polyGA spread is enhanced upon expression of longer GA DPRs. Transmission of polyGA is greater in older flies, indicating that age-associated factors exacerbate the spread. These data highlight a unique propensity of polyGA to spread throughout the brain, which could contribute to the greater abundance of polyGA in patient tissue. In addition, we present a model of early GA transmission that is suitable for genetic screens to identify mechanisms of spread and its consequences in vivo.",2019,"Javier Morón-Oset, Tessa Supèr, Jacqueline Esser, Adrian M Isaacs, Sebastian Grönke, Linda Partridge, Javier Morón-Oset, Tessa Supèr, Jacqueline Esser, Adrian M Isaacs, Sebastian Grönke, Linda Partridge"
Microtubules Stabilization by Mutant Spastin Affects ER Morphology and Ca 2+ Handling,31920731,10.3389/fphys.2019.01544,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extends as a network of interconnected tubules and sheet-like structures in eukaryotic cells. ER tubules dynamically change their morphology and position within the cells in response to physiological stimuli and these network rearrangements depend on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) relies on the repositioning of ER tubules to form specific ER-plasma membrane junctions. Indeed, the tips of polymerizing MTs are supposed to provide the anchor for ER tubules to move toward the plasma membrane, however the precise role of the cytoskeleton during SOCE has not been conclusively clarified. Here we exploit an in vivo approach involving the manipulation of MT dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster by neuronal expression of a dominant-negative variant of the MT-severing protein spastin to induce MT hyper-stabilization. We show that MT stabilization alters ER morphology, favoring an enrichment in ER sheets at the expense of tubules. Stabilizing MTs has a negative impact on the process of SOCE and results in a reduced ER Ca2+ content, affecting the flight ability of the flies. Restoring proper MT organization by administering the MT-destabilizing drug vinblastine, chronically or acutely, rescues ER morphology, SOCE and flight ability, indicating that MT dynamics impairment is responsible for all the phenotypes observed.",2019,"Nicola Vajente, Rosa Norante, Nelly Redolfi, Andrea Daga, Paola Pizzo, Diana Pendin, Nicola Vajente, Rosa Norante, Nelly Redolfi, Andrea Daga, Paola Pizzo, Diana Pendin"

Loss of expression of its ortholog, melted, in Drosophila results in a severe neural phenotype and impacts TOR, FoxO, and Hippo signaling. Studies in mammals indicate a role for VEPH1 in modulating TGFβ signaling and AKT activation, while numerous studies indicate VEPH1 expression is altered in several pathological conditions, including cancer.

Sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 couples mechanical cues and lipid metabolism,30902980,10.1038/s41467-019-09152-7,"Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate lipid biosynthesis and adipogenesis by controlling the expression of several enzymes required for cholesterol, fatty acid, triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. In vertebrates, SREBP activation is mainly controlled by a complex and well-characterized feedback mechanism mediated by cholesterol, a crucial bio-product of the SREBP-activated mevalonate pathway. In this work, we identified acto-myosin contractility and mechanical forces imposed by the extracellular matrix (ECM) as SREBP1 regulators. SREBP1 control by mechanical cues depends on geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, another key bio-product of the mevalonate pathway, and impacts on stem cell fate in mouse and on fat storage in Drosophila. Mechanistically, we show that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by ECM stiffening and geranylgeranylated RhoA-dependent acto-myosin contraction inhibits SREBP1 activation.

Transient localization of the Arp2/3 complex initiates neuronal dendrite branching in vivo,30910826,10.1242/dev.171397,"The formation of neuronal dendrite branches is fundamental for the wiring and function of the nervous system. Indeed, dendrite branching enhances the coverage of the neuron's receptive field and modulates the initial processing of incoming stimuli. Complex dendrite patterns are achieved in vivo through a dynamic process of de novo branch formation, branch extension and retraction. The first step towards branch formation is the generation of a dynamic filopodium-like branchlet. The mechanisms underlying the initiation of dendrite branchlets are therefore crucial to the shaping of dendrites. Through in vivo time-lapse imaging of the subcellular localization of actin during the process of branching of Drosophila larva sensory neurons, combined with genetic analysis and electron tomography, we have identified the Actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex as the major actin nucleator involved in the initiation of dendrite branchlet formation, under the control of the activator WAVE and of the small GTPase Rac1.

Does Divergence in Habitat Breadth Associate with Species Differences in Decision Making in Drosophila Sechellia and Drosophila Simulans?,32397481,10.3390/genes11050528,"Decision making is involved in many behaviors contributing to fitness, such as habitat choice, mate selection, and foraging. Because of this, high decision-making accuracy (i.e., selecting the option most beneficial for fitness) should be under strong selection. However, decision making is energetically costly, often involving substantial time and energy to survey the environment to obtain high-quality information. Thus, for high decision making accuracy to evolve, its benefits should outweigh its costs. Inconsistency in the net benefits of decision making across environments is hypothesized to be an important means for maintaining variation in this trait. However, very little is known about how environmental factors influence the evolution of decision making to produce variation among individuals, genotypes, and species. Here, we compared two recently diverged species of Drosophila differing substantially in habitat breadth and degree of environmental predictability and variability: Drosophila sechellia and Drosophila simulans.

We provide evidence of two naturally occurring types of balance between mitosis and enterocyte nucleus growth: one based mostly on stem cell mitosis producing new cells and the other based mostly on the degree of young enterocyte nucleus size increase. Mitosis promotes intestinal host defense to infection, but predisposes for dysplasia in the form of stem cell-like clusters. Enterocyte nucleus growth also promotes host defense, without the drawback of promoting dysplasia. Through quantitative genetics, we identified eiger as an autocrine and paracrine inducer of stem cell mitosis. eiger expression in immature epithelial cells tilts the balance towards mitosis and dysplasia via a positive-feedback loop of highly mitotic stem cells sustaining more small nucleus enterocytes, which in turn supply more Eiger.",2020,"Vasilia Tamamouna, Myrofora Panagi, Andria Theophanous, Maria Demosthenous, Maria Michail, Markella Papadopoulou, Savvas Teloni, Chrysoula Pitsouli, Yiorgos Apidianakis, Vasilia Tamamouna, Myrofora Panagi, Andria Theophanous, Maria Demosthenous, Maria Michail, Markella Papadopoulou, Savvas Teloni, Chrysoula Pitsouli, Yiorgos Apidianakis"

Insect V-ATPases are required in nearly all epithelial tissues to regulate a multiplicity of processes including receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein degradation, fluid secretion, and neurotransmission. Composed of fourteen different subunits, several V-ATPase subunits exist in distinct isoforms to perform cell type specific functions. The 100 kD a subunit (Vha100) of V-ATPases are encoded by a family of five genes in Drosophila, but their assignments are not fully understood. Here we report an experimental survey of the Vha100 gene family during Drosophila wing development. A combination of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, somatic clonal analysis and in vivo RNAi assays is used to characterize the requirement of Vha100 isoforms, and mutants of Vha100-2, Vha100-3, Vha100-4, and Vha100-5 genes were generated. We show that Vha100-3 and Vha100-5 are dispensable for fly development, while Vha100-1 is not critically required in the wing. As for the other two isoforms, we find that Vha100-2 regulates wing cuticle maturation, while Vha100-4 is the single isoform involved in developmental patterning.

The role of DNA repair genes in radiation-induced adaptive response in Drosophila melanogaster is differential and conditional,31624983,10.1007/s10522-019-09842-1,"Studies in human and mammalian cell cultures have shown that induction of DNA repair mechanisms is required for the formation of stimulation effects of low doses of ionizing radiation, named ""hormesis"". Nevertheless, the role of cellular defense mechanisms in the formation of radiation-induced hormesis at the level of whole organism remains poorly studied. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of genes involved in different mechanisms and stages of DNA repair in radioadaptive response and radiation hormesis by lifespan parameters in Drosophila melanogaster. We studied genes that control DNA damage sensing (D-Gadd45, Hus1, mnk), nucleotide excision repair (mei-9, mus210, Mus209), base excision repair (Rrp1), DNA double-stranded break repair by homologous recombination (Brca2, spn-B, okr) and non-homologous end joining (Ku80, WRNexo), and the Mus309 gene that participates in several mechanisms of DNA repair. The obtained results demonstrate that in flies with mutations in studied genes radioadaptive response and radiation hormesis are absent or appear to a lesser extent than in wild-type Canton-S flies. Chronic exposure of γ-radiation in a low dose during pre-imaginal stages of development leads to an increase in expression of the studied DNA repair genes, which is maintained throughout the lifespan of flies. However, the activation of conditional ubiquitous overexpression of DNA repair genes does not induce resistance to an acute exposure to γ-radiation and reinforces its negative impact.",2020,"Liubov Koval, Ekaterina Proshkina, Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Alexey Moskalev, Liubov Koval, Ekaterina Proshkina, Mikhail Shaposhnikov, Alexey Moskalev"
