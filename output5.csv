Centrobin is essential for C-tubule assembly and flagellum development in Drosophila melanogaster spermatogenesis,29712734,10.1083/jcb.201801032,"Centrobin homologues identified in different species localize on daughter centrioles. In Drosophila melanogaster sensory neurons, Centrobin (referred to as CNB in Drosophila) inhibits basal body function. These data open the question of CNB's role in spermatocytes, where daughter and mother centrioles become basal bodies. In this study, we report that in these cells, CNB localizes equally to mother and daughter centrioles and is essential for C-tubules to attain the right position and remain attached to B-tubules as well as for centrioles to grow in length. CNB appears to be dispensable for meiosis, but flagellum development is severely compromised in Cnb mutant males. Remarkably, three N-terminal POLO phosphorylation sites that are critical for CNB function in neuroblasts are dispensable for spermatogenesis. Our results underpin the multifunctional nature of CNB that plays different roles in different cell types in Drosophila, and they identify CNB as an essential component for C-tubule assembly and flagellum development in Drosophila spermatogenesis.",2018,"Jose Reina, Marco Gottardo, Maria G Riparbelli, Salud Llamazares, Giuliano Callaini, Cayetano Gonzalez, Jose Reina, Marco Gottardo, Maria G Riparbelli, Salud Llamazares, Giuliano Callaini, Cayetano Gonzalez"
Citron kinase is an essential effector of the Pbl-activated Rho signalling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster,15459099,10.1242/dev.01382,"Pebble (Pbl)-activated RhoA signalling is essential for cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Here we report that the Drosophila citron gene encodes an essential effector kinase of Pbl-RhoA signalling in vivo. Drosophila citron is expressed in proliferating tissues but is downregulated in differentiating tissues. We find that Citron can bind RhoA and that localisation of Citron to the contractile ring is dependent on the cytokinesis-specific Pbl-RhoA signalling. Phenotypic analysis of mutants showed that citron is required for cytokinesis in every tissue examined, with mutant cells exhibiting multinucleate and hyperploid phenotypes. Strong genetic interactions were observed between citron and pbl alleles and constructs. Vertebrate studies implicate at least two Rho effector kinases, Citron and Rok, in cytokinesis. By contrast, we failed to find evidence for a role for the Drosophila ortholog of Rok in cell division. We conclude that Citron plays an essential, non-redundant role in the Rho signalling pathway during Drosophila cytokinesis.",2004,"Tetyana Shandala, Stephen L Gregory, Hazel E Dalton, Masha Smallhorn, Robert Saint, Tetyana Shandala, Stephen L Gregory, Hazel E Dalton, Masha Smallhorn, Robert Saint"
A mild cold stress that increases resistance to heat lowers FOXO translocation in Drosophila melanogaster,28677014,10.1007/s10522-017-9722-8,"Previous studies have shown that subjecting Drosophila melanogaster flies to a mild stress at young or middle age can increase lifespan and resistance to severe stresses throughout life and that the NF-κB-like transcription factor DIF, the 70 kDa heat-shock proteins, and the Drosophila Forkhead box class O (dFOXO) transcription factor could explain some of these effects. The present study showed that two dFOXO mutants do not survive longer heat if previously subjected to a mild cold stress, contrarily to wild-type flies. This cold pretreatment had nearly no effect on dFOXO nuclear translocation in wild-type males. Heat stress strongly increased dFOXO translocation, but this effect was lowered in cold-pretreated males. Because cold-pretreated wild-type males survived longer heat and had nevertheless a lower dFOXO translocation after this heat stress, one can conclude that dFOXO is required to resist heat but that the cold pretreatment makes that other mechanisms partly substitute to dFOXO translocation.",2017,"Cédric Polesello, Eric Le Bourg, Cédric Polesello, Eric Le Bourg"
Regulation of purine biosynthesis in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells: II/relationships between hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase and 5'-nucleotidase,6160879,10.1016/s0300-9084(80)80023-x,"All in vitro cell lines from Drosophila melanogaster do not possess measurable hypoxanthine - guanine - phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) and 5'-nucleotidase activities. Nevertheless these enzymatic activities could be detected by the modification of culture conditions or treatment of crude extracts from Drosophila cells (1). A Drosophila melanogaster hemocyte line enabled demonstration of a relationship between the activities of HGPRT and 5'-nucleotidase. Only the addition of azaserine to the culture medium allows detection of a measurable amount of HGPRT and 5'-nucleotidase in cells devoid of endogenous synthesis of purine nucleotides. This action of azaserine suggests that the simultaneous expression of both enzymes is first directed by the suppression of the 5'-nucleotidase inhibition by pyrimidine nucleotides, and later on by the 5'-nucleotidase activity hydrolyzing the mononucleotides which inhibited the HGPRT, resulting its expression. This regulation system is confirmed by the simultaneous recovery of HGPRT and 5'-nucleotidase activities after heating cell cultures or cell extracts. Under such experimental conditions, 5'-nucleotidase is desensitized towards its negative effectors, while HGPRT regulation remains unchanged.",1980,"J L Becker, J L Becker"

Native microbial colonization of Drosophila melanogaster and its use as a model of Enterococcus faecalis pathogenesis,17220307,10.1128/IAI.01496-06,"Enterococci are commensal organisms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of a broad range of mammalian and insect hosts, but they are also leading causes of nosocomial infection. Little is known about the ecological role of enterococci in the GI tract consortia. To develop a tractable model for studying the roles of these organisms as commensals and pathogens, we characterized the Drosophila melanogaster microflora and examined the occurrence of enterococci in the gastrointestinal consortium of Drosophila. In a survey of laboratory-reared Drosophila and wild-captured flies, we found that Drosophila was naturally colonized by representatives of five bacterial phyla. Among these organisms were several species of enterococci, including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinaraum, and Enterococcus durans, as well as a previously detected but uncultured Enterococcus species. Drosophila could be cured of enterococcal carriage by antibiotic treatment and could be reassociated with laboratory strains. High-level colonization by a well-characterized strain expressing the enterococcal cytolysin was found to be detrimental to Drosophila compared to the effect of an isogenic, noncytolytic control. The anatomical distribution of enterococci in the Drosophila GI tract was determined by immunohistochemical staining of thin sections of naturally colonized and reassociated flies.",2007,"Christopher R Cox, Michael S Gilmore, Christopher R Cox, Michael S Gilmore"
Characterization and expression of collagen-like genes in Drosophila melanogaster,3017484,10.1111/j.1768-322x.1986.tb00453.x,"We have used a cloned chicken collagen cDNA sequence to help identify hypothetic members of the collagen gene family from Drosophila melanogaster. Several experimental evidences have been obtained which indicate that the Drosophila genome contains numerous collagen-like sequences. We have characterized in more detail ten distinct DNA sequences that hybridized strongly to the heterologous collagen probe. By in situ hybridization we have shown that these sequences are dispersed throughout the Drosophila genome. Two of them are shown to originate from the previously described DCg 1 and DCg 2 collagen genes. In other respects, we show that in addition to DCg 1 and DCg 2, at least five putative collagen genes are expressed during the Drosophila lifetime. These genes are unique, and some of them are seen to be transcribed into different size classes of mRNAs. Additionally, the data presented so far demonstrate that the expression of these genes is regulated temporally and/or quantitatively during the Drosophila life cycle.",1986,"Y Le Parco, J P Cecchini, B Knibiehler, C Mirre, Y Le Parco, J P Cecchini, B Knibiehler, C Mirre"

Interaction of casein kinase II with ribosomal protein L22 of Drosophila melanogaster,12379220,10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02396-3,"The ubiquitous eukaryotic protein kinase CKII (casein kinase II) has been found to interact with a number of cellular proteins, either through the catalytic subunit or the regulatory subunit. Using the yeast two-hybrid screening method, we found that the catalytic subunit of Drosophila melanogaster CKII (DmCKII) interacts with Drosophila ribosomal protein L22 (rpL22). This interaction was also observed in vitro with a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-rpL22 fusion protein. The predicted full-length Drosophila rpL22 protein has an N-terminal extension rich in alanine, lysine, and proline that appears to be unique to Drosophila. Deletion mapping revealed that the conserved core of rpL22 is responsible for the interaction with CKII. Moreover, purified DmCKII can phosphorylate a GST-L22 fusion protein at the C-terminal end, suggesting that this protein may be a substrate of CKII in Drosophila.",2002,"Wenfan Zhao, Ashok P Bidwai, Claiborne V C Glover, Wenfan Zhao, Ashok P Bidwai, Claiborne V C Glover"
Molecular characterization of Drosophila melanogaster myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase,11121586,10.1016/s0167-4781(00)00085-3,"We have isolated and characterized a cDNA encoding Drosophila melanogaster myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (INOS). The deduced Drosophila INOS protein is 50% identical to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO1 gene. The putative active site residues are well conserved in Drosophila INOS protein. Southern blot analysis shows that Drosophila INOS gene is a single copy gene. Northern blot analysis reveals that Drosophila INOS gene expresses a 2.0-kb transcript that is more abundant in the head than the body, suggesting that it may be involved in brain function. The recombinant Drosophila INOS protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified protein has proved to have a myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase activity.",2000,"D Park, S Jeong, S Lee, S Park, J I Kim, J Yim, D Park, S Jeong, S Lee, S Park, J I Kim, J Yim"
Expression and translocation of Drosophila nuclear encoded cytochrome b(5) proteins to mitochondria,10899459,10.1016/s0965-1748(00)00064-3,DNA sequence studies of cytochrome b(5) (Cyt-b) genes from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis predict that the Drosophila Cyt-b proteins are extremely hydrophobic and have at least eight potential transmembrane spanning domains. Primary protein sequence analysis also predicts that the Cyt-b proteins have mitochondrial targeting sequences and they contain sites for potential post-translational modification similar to other cytochrome proteins. We report the characterization of the cytochrome b(5) proteins from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. We have used a Drosophila cytochrome b(5) specific antibody to demonstrate that cytochrome b(5) proteins are expressed in muscle-containing tissues in the fly. We also provide evidence that the nuclear encoded cytochrome b(5) protein that contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence is translocated to mitochondria.,2000,"M E Kula, C E Rozek, M E Kula, C E Rozek"

Oxidative stress resistance as a factor in aging: evidence from an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster,31054025,10.1007/s10522-019-09812-7,"Longevity of a species is a multifactorial quantitative trait influenced by genetic background, sex, age and environment of the organism. Extended longevity phenotypes (ELP) from experimental evolution in the laboratory can be used as model systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. ELPs of Drosophila are correlated with various life history attributes such as resistance to environmental stressors (starvation, desiccation, cold and paraquat), developmental time, biochemical defenses, etc. The association between oxidative stress resistance and longevity is not clear and ELPs offer an opportunity to examine the role of oxidative stress resistance in longevity. Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress resistance and elevated antioxidant defense system play a positive role in longevity using an ELP of Drosophila melanogaster. An ELP of D. melanogaster isolated and characterized in our laboratory through artificial selection (inbred laboratory strain of Oregon K) is employed in this study. Our ELP, named as long lifespan (LLS) flies, shows marked extension in lifespan when compared to the progenitor population (normal lifespan, NLS) and makes a suitable model to study the role of mitochondrial genome in longevity because of its least heterogeneity. In this study, sensitivity to ethanol with age was employed as a measure of resistance to oxidative stress in NLS and LLS flies. Effect of age and oxidative stress on longevity was examined by employing NLS and LLS flies of different age groups against ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Results show that the lower mortality against ethanol was associated with enhanced oxidative stress resistance, higher antioxidant defenses, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activity and better locomotor ability attributes of LLS flies. In addition, age-related changes like locomotor impairments, decreased antioxidant defenses, higher ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidative stress were delayed in LLS flies when compared to NLS. Our study supports the hypothesis that higher oxidative stress resistance and enhanced antioxidant defenses are significant factors in extending longevity.",2019,"S Deepashree, S Niveditha, T Shivanandappa, S R Ramesh, S Deepashree, S Niveditha, T Shivanandappa, S R Ramesh"
Digital gene expression profiling (DGE) of cadmium-treated Drosophila melanogaster,25543212,10.1016/j.etap.2014.11.024,"Cadmium is highly toxic and can cause oxidative damage, metabolic disorders, and reduced lifespan and fertility in animals. In this study, we investigated the effects of cadmium in Drosophila melanogaster, performing transcriptome analysis by using tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) profiling. Among 1970 candidate genes, 1443 were up-regulated and 527 were down-regulated following cadmium exposure. Using Gene Ontology analysis, we found that cadmium stress affects three processes: transferase activity, stress response, and the cell cycle. Furthermore, we identified five differentially expressed genes (confirmed by real-time PCR) involved in all three processes: Ald, Cdc2, skpA, tefu, and Pvr. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were involved in the cell cycle pathway and fat digestion and absorption pathway. This study reveals the gene expression response to cadmium stress in Drosophila, it provides insights into the mechanisms of this response, and it could contribute to our understanding of cadmium toxicity in humans.",2015,"Delong Guan, Fei Mo, Yan Han, Wei Gu, Min Zhang, Delong Guan, Fei Mo, Yan Han, Wei Gu, Min Zhang"
"[Symbiotic bacteria, which modify reproduction processes of Drosophila melanogaster]",21598659,,"Cytoplasmic bacteria-symbionts are actively investigated all over the world for the last ten years. The scale of their spreading in natural and laboratory populations of invertebrates, especially arthropods, is impressing scientists' imagination. Ways of their intraspecific and interspecific transmission are various. The nature and mechanisms of their interaction both between themselves and with their hosts are extremely diverse. Cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, male-killing, feminization, tissue degeneration and others are those phenotypic effects, which intracellular bacteria can cause in their hosts. Moreover, the same bacterium can have diverse influences on different hosts. So it is possible to talk about many-sidedness of endosymbiont interaction with a host, which is determined both by bacterium and host biology. However, majority of phenotypic effects is directed to the successful colonization of hosts' populations by increasing the number of infected females. Alas, the mechanisms of interaction are still not enough investigated. Besides, intracellular bacteria-symbionts can be one of the factors of the so-called ""infectious species formation"". In any investigation, model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster belonging to them, take a special place. Among drosophila's endosymbionts, only bacteria from genera Wolbachia, Spiroplasma and Cardinium were broadly investigated: their spreading in Drosophila melanogaster populations all over the world, the infecting level and those phenotypic effects, which they can cause. So this review is dedicated to analysis of these studies.",2011,"A O Belousov, I A Kozeretskaia, A O Belousov, I A Kozeretskaia"

In melanogaster, the relative efficiency of selection was inversely related to the initial level. In simulans, whose natural tolerance is particularly low, only a small increase was obtained. In all cases, tolerance increased progressively and could be considered as a quantitative character. These results are probably due to modifier genes of the alcohol dehydrogenase locus.",1977,"J David, C Bocquet, P Fouillet, M F Arens, J David, C Bocquet, P Fouillet, M F Arens"
Sex-specific effects of mitochondrial haplotype on metabolic rate in Drosophila melanogaster support predictions of the Mother's Curse hypothesis,31787038,10.1098/rstb.2019.0178,"Evolutionary theory proposes that maternal inheritance of mitochondria will facilitate the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that are harmful to males but benign or beneficial to females. Furthermore, mtDNA haplotypes sampled from across a given species distribution are expected to differ in the number and identity of these 'male-harming' mutations they accumulate. Consequently, it is predicted that the genetic variation which delineates distinct mtDNA haplotypes of a given species should confer larger phenotypic effects on males than females (reflecting mtDNA mutations that are male-harming, but female-benign), or sexually antagonistic effects (reflecting mutations that are male-harming, but female-benefitting). These predictions have received support from recent work examining mitochondrial haplotypic effects on adult life-history traits in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we explore whether similar signatures of male-bias or sexual antagonism extend to a key physiological trait-metabolic rate. We measured the effects of mitochondrial haplotypes on the amount of carbon dioxide produced by individual flies, controlling for mass and activity, across 13 strains of D. melanogaster that differed only in their mtDNA haplotype. The effects of mtDNA haplotype on metabolic rate were larger in males than females. Furthermore, we observed a negative intersexual correlation across the haplotypes for metabolic rate. Finally, we uncovered a male-specific negative correlation, across haplotypes, between metabolic rate and longevity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal mitochondrial inheritance has led to the accumulation of a sex-specific genetic load within the mitochondrial genome, which affects metabolic rate and that may have consequences for the evolution of sex differences in life history. This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking the mitochondrial genotype to phenotype: a complex endeavour'.",2020,"Venkatesh Nagarajan-Radha, Ian Aitkenhead, David J Clancy, Steven L Chown, Damian K Dowling, Venkatesh Nagarajan-Radha, Ian Aitkenhead, David J Clancy, Steven L Chown, Damian K Dowling"
The effect of mating history on male reproductive ageing in Drosophila melanogaster,30312587,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.10.003,"Mating bears costs, but how these costs affect the senescence of reproductive traits in males has received relatively little attention. Males of many species show reduced benefits from pre- and post-copulatory reproductive traits during ageing. Senescence of post-copulatory reproductive traits is often linked to a reduction in sperm quantity and quality, but can also be a consequence of changes in seminal fluid proteins that are transferred alongside sperm during mating. Here we investigated how mating history affects male reproductive ageing, especially at the post-copulatory level, using Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which links between seminal fluid proteins and male reproductive traits are well established. Besides a male cohort kept virgin until the start of the experiment we also included a cohort of males kept together with females allowing for ample mating opportunities. With these males we conducted a series of behavioral experiments covering several aspects of male reproductive success with males ranging in age from 4 days to 6 weeks after eclosion. Additionally, we investigated the storage capacity of male accessory glands (AG), the production site of the majority of seminal fluid proteins. We found male reproductive success to decline with increasing male age and, most importantly, males with prior matings showed a reduced performance in pre-copulatory success. However, our data suggest a constant short-term cost of mating rather than an accelerated senescence of pre-copulatory traits. In contrast, senescence of post-copulatory reproductive traits differed between mated and virgin males, hinting at mating costs in males altering the ageing process. We could not find any differences in the capacity of the AG to store seminal fluid proteins, however, our data suggest that old males transfer fewer seminal fluid proteins in a single mating. We conclude that a variety of traits is affected by male reproductive ageing in D. melanogaster with the cost of mating varying in its impact on senescence in these traits.",2018,"Mareike Koppik, Hanna Ruhmann, Claudia Fricke, Mareike Koppik, Hanna Ruhmann, Claudia Fricke"
Long-chain dietary fatty acids affect the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to tolerate ethanol,8421221,10.1093/jn/123.1.106,"Four-day post-hatch larvae (mid-third instar) of Drosophila melanogaster were fed an intermediate diet with or without supplement of an individual fatty acid for 2 d and then transferred to a diet with a growth-limiting level of 0.94 mol/L ethanol (5.5%, v/v) or an ethanol-free diet. The ethanol stress decreased survival and larval development rate but increased the weight of surviving adult males. Dietary long-chain fatty acids altered the fatty acid composition of tissue lipids of larvae. When an unsaturated fatty acid was fed, except for 18:2(n-6), the tissue level of total unsaturated fatty acids was markedly increased. Both saturated and unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids shortened larval development time. Linoleic acid [18:2(n-6)] and linolenic acid [18:3(n-3)] enhanced survival overall and, together with stearic acid (18:0), gave marked protection from ethanol stress in terms of survival. Correlation analysis across the different fatty acid diets indicated a strong positive association between tissue 18-carbon fatty acid levels and ethanol tolerance and between 18-carbon fatty acid levels and development rate. No major differences were observed in the effects of the fatty acids on the Canton-S and OD4 (Tahbilk) wild-type strains. Thus, the fatty acid content of D. melanogaster larvae is important for growth and survival in ethanol-rich habitats.",1993,"S W McKechnie, B W Geer, S W McKechnie, B W Geer"

This is the first finding of mucin-type glycoprotein in insects. Using high-affinity monoclonal antibodies against a carbohydrate epitope, we demonstrated that the accumulation of this glycoprotein in the culture fluid of Drosophila cell line and cultured cells of other insects was inhibited by secretion inhibitors. 20-hydroxyecdysone, a hormone responsible for molting and metamorphosis in insects, inhibits the accumulation of this glycoprotein in the culture fluid, as well as in cells of Drosophila Dm cell line. In another cell line (Schneider-2), where there was practically no secretion of this glycoprotein, the hormone induced its increased accumulation in the cells. Mucin glycoproteins recognized by monoclonal antibodies have been found in embryos, imaginal disc, fat body, testicles, and ovaries, but not in salivary glands or muscles of Drosophila.",1997,"A A Kramerov, E A Mikhaleva, T V Pochechueva, Ia M Rozovskiĭ, N A Baĭkova, V A Gvozdev, A A Kramerov, E A Mikhaleva, T V Pochechueva, Ia M Rozovskiĭ, N A Baĭkova, V A Gvozdev"
Exposure to Spectracide® causes behavioral deficits in Drosophila melanogaster: Insights from locomotor analysis and molecular modeling,32018111,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126037,"This study was focused on gaining insights into the mechanism by which the herbicide- Spectracide®, induces oxidative stress and alters behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. Exposure to Spectracide® (50%) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the negative geotaxis response, jumping behavior and dampened locomotor activity rhythm in adult flies compared to non-exposed flies. Protein carbonyl levels indicative of oxidative damage increased significantly coupled with down-regulation of Sniffer gene expression encoding carbonyl reductase (CR) and its activity in Spectracide®-exposed flies. In silico modeling analysis revealed that the active ingredients of Spectracide® (atrazine, diquat dibromide, fluazifop-p-butyl, and dicamba) have significant binding affinity to the active site of CR enzyme, with atrazine having comparatively greater affinity. Our results suggest a mechanism by which ingredients in Spectracide® induce oxidative damage by competitive binding to the active site of a protective enzyme and impair its ability to prevent damage to proteins thereby leading to deficits in locomotor behavior in Drosophila.",2020,"Ankur Chaudhuri, Roishinique Johnson, Kuntol Rakshit, Andrea Bedná?ová, Kimberly Lackey, Sibani Sen Chakraborty, Natraj Krishnan, Anathbandhu Chaudhuri, Ankur Chaudhuri, Roishinique Johnson, Kuntol Rakshit, Andrea Bedná?ová, Kimberly Lackey, Sibani Sen Chakraborty, Natraj Krishnan, Anathbandhu Chaudhuri"
"Roundup ®, but Not Roundup-Ready ® Corn, Increases Mortality of Drosophila melanogaster",31370250,10.3390/toxics7030038,"Genetically modified foods have become pervasive in diets of people living in the US. By far the most common genetically modified foods either tolerate herbicide application (HT) or produce endogenous insecticide (Bt). To determine whether these toxicological effects result from genetic modification per se, or from the increase in herbicide or insecticide residues present on the food, we exposed fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, to food containing HT corn that had been sprayed with the glyphosate-based herbicide Roundup®, HT corn that had not been sprayed with Roundup®, or Roundup® in a variety of known glyphosate concentrations and formulations. While neither lifespan nor reproductive behaviors were affected by HT corn, addition of Roundup® increased mortality with an LC50 of 7.1 g/L for males and 11.4 g/L for females after 2 days of exposure. Given the many genetic tools available, Drosophila are an excellent model system for future studies about genetic and biochemical mechanisms of glyphosate toxicity.",2019,"Becky Talyn, Rachael Lemon, Maryam Badoella, Darwin Melchiorre, Maryori Villalobos, Raquel Elias, Kelly Muller, Maggie Santos, Erik Melchiorre, Becky Talyn, Rachael Lemon, Maryam Badoella, Darwin Melchiorre, Maryori Villalobos, Raquel Elias, Kelly Muller, Maggie Santos, Erik Melchiorre"
Genotoxicity of lapachol evaluated by wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster,21637432,10.1590/S1415-47572010005000070,"This study investigated the genotoxicity of Lapachol (LAP) evaluated by wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster in the descendants from standard (ST) and high bioactivation (HB) crosses. This assay detects the loss of heterozygosity of marker genes expressed phenotypically on the fly's wings. Drosophila has extensive genetic homology to mammals, which makes it a suitable model organism for genotoxic investigations. Three-day-old larvae from ST crosses (females flr(3)/TM3, Bd(s) x males mwh/mwh), with basal levels of the cytochrome P450 and larvae of high metabolic bioactivity capacity (HB cross) (females ORR; flr(3)/TM3, Bd(s) x males mwh/mwh), were used. The results showed that LAP is a promutagen, exhibiting genotoxic activity in larvae from the HB cross. In other words, an increase in the frequency of spots is exclusive of individuals with a high level of the cytochrome P450. The results also indicate that recombinogenicity is the main genotoxic event induced by LAP.",2010,"Wender Ferreira Costa, Alaide Braga de Oliveira, Júlio César Nepomuceno, Wender Ferreira Costa, Alaide Braga de Oliveira, Júlio César Nepomuceno"
Role of arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase in regulation of biogenic amines levels by gonadotropins in Drosophila,18038140,10.1007/s00360-007-0224-x,"The effect of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the juvenile hormone (JH) on the activity of the arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) was studied in young females of wild-type D. virilis and D. melanogaster. 20E feeding of the flies led to a decrease in AANAT activity in both species when dopamine (DA) was used as substrate, but did not affect the enzyme activity when octopamine (OA) was used as substrate. JH application increased AANAT activity with DA as substrate in both species, but did not change it with OA as substrate. AANAT activity was also measured in young females of a JH-deficient strain of D. melanogaster, apterous ( 56f ). A decrease in the enzyme activity was observed in the mutant females as compared to wild-type.

Intranuclear virus-like particles of a Drosophila hybrid,12117278,,"Intranuclear virus-like particles (VLPs) have been observed in different cell lines and adult tissues of Drosophila. In the present study, intranuclear VLPs have been found in larval tissues (salivary glands, midgut, fat body) as well as in adult tissues (midgut, genitals, fat body) of a rare interspecific hybrid (D. mauritiana x D. melanogaster) called 'mame'. The intranuclear VLPs were round or slightly elliptical with a diameter of 30 nm, and they were found mainly in highly organised clusters, forming large crystalline arrays, near the nucleolus and the polycene chromosomes. These particles were never observed in the cytoplasm of any mame's tissue. A few VLPs were also seen in the corresponding tissues of D. melanogaster, but they were never observed in any tissue of D. mauritiana. There is the intriguing possibility that these VLPs are related to transposable elements and probably contribute to the speciation process, in an unknown, so far, manner.",2002,"A Kosta, G N Thomopoulos, A Kosta, G N Thomopoulos"

Transgenerational impact of DEHP on body weight of Drosophila,30660905,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.12.193,"Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most typical plasticizer and an environmental endocrine disruptor (EDC). DEHP is known to influence offspring fertility, growth, and obesity. However, the role of the DEHP as a transgenerational obesogen is still controversial. In this study, we used fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to investigate where the exposure period, doses, and exposed parental sex are critical to change the body weight of the offspring. We found long-term but not short-term, and high-dose but low-dose exposure resulted in significant change. Moreover, we found DEHP treatment on the father or mother Drosophila resulted in increased or decreased body weight of the offspring respectively. Our results demonstrated the heterogeneity of transgenerational impact of DEHP and highlighted the involvement of parental endocrine system in its role as an obesogen.",2019,"Mei-Ying Chen, Hsin-Ping Liu, Jack Cheng, Su-Yin Chiang, Wing-Ping Liao, Wei-Yong Lin, Mei-Ying Chen, Hsin-Ping Liu, Jack Cheng, Su-Yin Chiang, Wing-Ping Liao, Wei-Yong Lin"
Drosophila melanogaster as a model system for the study of the function of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in synaptic plasticity,9783436,10.1007/BF02480364,"Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a biological model system for almost a century. In the last several decades, Drosophila has been used as a system to probe the molecular basis of behavior and discoveries in the fly have been at the forefront of the elucidation of important basic mechanisms. This review will outline the variety of approaches that make Drosophila an excellent model system with which to study the function of the enzyme calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in synaptic plasticity. CaMKII has a well documented role in behavior and synaptic plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The behavioral and genetic richness of Drosophila allow for a multi-level approach to understanding the physiological roles of this enzyme's function.",1997,"L C Griffith, L C Griffith"
Evaluation of mutagenic effect of the fungicide fenaminosulf in Drosophila melanogaster,6402695,10.1016/0165-7992(83)90175-6,"Fenaminosulf (p-dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate, CAS registry No. 140-56-7) which is an active ingredient in several commercial fungicides was reported to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium (McCann et al., 1975), Bacillus subtilis (Kada et al., 1974) and shown to cause chromosome aberrations in plants (Zutshi and Kaul, 1975). Since fenaminosulf has structural similarity to the potent carcinogen, butter yellow (p-dimethylaminoazobenzene, CAS registry No. 60-11-7), the present studies were undertaken to evaluate the mutagenic potential of this fungicide in Drosophila melanogaster. Fenaminosulf administered at 10 mg/100 ml food medium failed to induce sex-linked recessive mutations in Drosophila. Since Drosophila has drug-metabolizing enzymes similar to those of mammals (Vogel, 1975), it is suggested that the lack of mutagenic activity of fenaminosulf could be due to the conversion of fenaminosulf to non-mutagenic derivatives in Drosophila.",1983,"S B Pai, S B Pai"

Differentially expressed profiles in the larval testes of Wolbachia infected and uninfected Drosophila,22145623,10.1186/1471-2164-12-595,"Background:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia are endosymbiotic bacteria that are frequently found in arthropods and nematodes. These maternally inherited bacteria manipulate host reproduction by several mechanisms including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI is the most common phenotype induced by Wolbachia and results in the developmental arrest of embryos derived from crosses between Wolbachia-infected males and uninfected females. Although the molecular mechanisms of CI are currently unknown, several studies suggest that host sperm is modified by Wolbachia during spermatogenesis.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We compared the gene expression of Drosophila melanogaster larval testes with and without the wMel strain of Wolbachia to identify candidate genes that could be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and the insect host. Microarray, quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses were carried out on D. melanogaster larval testes to determine the effect of Wolbachia infection on host gene expression. A total of 296 genes were identified by microarray analysis to have at least a 1.5 fold change [q-value < 5%] in expression. When comparing Wolbachia-infected flies to uninfected flies, 167 genes were up-regulated and 129 genes down-regulated. Differential expression of genes related to metabolism, immunity, reproduction and other functions were observed. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed 12 genes are differentially expressed in the testes of the 3rd instar larvae of Wolbachia-infected and uninfected flies. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Wolbachia infection changes the expression of several genes putatively associated with spermatogenesis including JH induced protein-26 and Mst84Db, or involved in immune (kenny) or metabolism (CG4988-RA).
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Wolbachia change the gene expression of 296 genes in the larval testes of D. melanogaster including genes related to metabolism, immunity and reproduction. Interestingly, most of the genes putatively involved in immunity were up-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. In contrast, most of the genes putatively associated with reproduction (especially spermatogenesis) were down-regulated in the presence of Wolbachia. These results suggest Wolbachia may activate the immune pathway but inhibit spermatogenesis. Our data provide a significant panel of candidate genes that may be involved in the interaction between Wolbachia and their insect hosts. This forms a basis to help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of Wolbachia-induced CI in Drosophila and the influence of Wolbachia on spermatogenesis.",2011,"Ya Zheng, Jia-Lin Wang, Chen Liu, Cui-Ping Wang, Thomas Walker, Yu-Feng Wang, Ya Zheng, Jia-Lin Wang, Chen Liu, Cui-Ping Wang, Thomas Walker, Yu-Feng Wang"
Imaging cilia in Drosophila melanogaster,25837397,10.1016/bs.mcb.2014.12.009,"Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful genetic model organism to understand the function of proteins in specific cellular processes. Cilia have been extensively studied in Drosophila playing various sensory functions that are essential for fly survival. Indeed, flies defective in cilia formation cannot walk, fly, or feed properly. Drosophila harbors different types of cilia that can be motile or immotile or that can show compartimentalized (intraflagellar transport (IFT)-dependent) or cytoplasmic (IFT-independent) mode of assembly. Therefore, Drosophila represents an advantageous model organism to study the function of novel ciliary candidates and to address specific questions such as their requirement for IFT-dependent processes versus other aspects of cilia-associated functions. This chapter describes protocols to visualize cilia by direct or indirect fluorescent labeling and protocols to analyze ciliary ultrastructure by electron microscopy.",2015,"Jennifer Vieillard, Jean-Luc Duteyrat, Elisabeth Cortier, Bénédicte Durand, Jennifer Vieillard, Jean-Luc Duteyrat, Elisabeth Cortier, Bénédicte Durand"
Metallothionein genes in Drosophila melanogaster constitute a dual system,3106973,10.1073/pnas.84.9.2658,"We have selected a metallothionein (MT) cDNA clone from a cadmium-resistant Drosophila melanogaster cell line. This clone includes an open reading frame coding for a 43-amino acid protein whose characteristics are a high cysteine content (12 cysteines, 28% of all residues) and a lack of aromatic amino acids. This protein differs markedly from the Drosophila MT (Mtn gene) previously reported [Lastowski-Perry, D., Otto, E. & Maroni, G. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1527-1530). The MT system of Drosophila thus consists of at least two distantly related genes, in sharp contrast with vertebrate MT systems, in which the different members of MT gene families display high similarity. The gene corresponding to our MT cDNA (Mto) is inducible in Drosophila cell lines and in both larval and adult flies.",1987,"R Mokdad, A Debec, M Wegnez, R Mokdad, A Debec, M Wegnez"
Genome engineering: Drosophila melanogaster and beyond,26447401,10.1002/wdev.214,"A central challenge in investigating biological phenomena is the development of techniques to modify genomic DNA with nucleotide precision that can be transmitted through the germ line. Recent years have brought a boon in these technologies, now collectively known as genome engineering. Defined genomic manipulations at the nucleotide level enable a variety of reverse engineering paradigms, providing new opportunities to interrogate diverse biological functions. These genetic modifications include controlled removal, insertion, and substitution of genetic fragments, both small and large. Small fragments up to a few kilobases (e.g., single nucleotide mutations, small deletions, or gene tagging at single or multiple gene loci) to large fragments up to megabase resolution can be manipulated at single loci to create deletions, duplications, inversions, or translocations of substantial sections of whole chromosome arms. A specialized substitution of chromosomal portions that presumably are functionally orthologous between different organisms through syntenic replacement, can provide proof of evolutionary conservation between regulatory sequences. Large transgenes containing endogenous or synthetic DNA can be integrated at defined genomic locations, permitting an alternative proof of evolutionary conservation, and sophisticated transgenes can be used to interrogate biological phenomena. Precision engineering can additionally be used to manipulate the genomes of organelles (e.g., mitochondria). Novel genome engineering paradigms are often accelerated in existing, easily genetically tractable model organisms, primarily because these paradigms can be integrated in a rigorous, existing technology foundation. The Drosophila melanogaster fly model is ideal for these types of studies. Due to its small genome size, having just four chromosomes, the vast amount of cutting-edge genetic technologies, and its short life-cycle and inexpensive maintenance requirements, the fly is exceptionally amenable to complex genetic analysis using advanced genome engineering. Thus, highly sophisticated methods developed in the fly model can be used in nearly any sequenced organism. Here, we summarize different ways to perform precise inheritable genome engineering using integrases, recombinases, and DNA nucleases in the D. melanogaster.

A fragmented alignment method detects a putative phosphorylation site and a putative BRC repeat in the Drosophila melanogaster BRCA2 protein,24627786,10.12688/f1000research.2-143.v2,"Mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein leave individuals susceptible to breast, ovarian and other cancers. The BRCA2 protein is a critical component of the DNA repair pathways in eukaryotes, and also plays an integral role in fostering genomic variability through meiotic recombination. Although present in many eukaryotes, as a whole the BRCA2 gene is weakly conserved. Conserved fragments of 30 amino acids (BRC repeats), which mediate interactions with the recombinase RAD51, helped detect orthologs of this protein in other organisms. The carboxy-terminal of the human BRCA2 has been shown to be phosphorylated by checkpoint kinases (Chk1/Chk2) at T3387, which regulate the sequestration of RAD51 on DNA damage. However, apart from three BRC repeats, the Drosophila melanogaster gene has not been annotated and associated with other functionally relevant sequence fragments in human BRCA2. In the current work, the carboxy-terminal phosphorylation threonine site (E=9.1e-4) and a new BRC repeat (E=17e-4) in D. melanogaster has been identified, using a fragmented alignment methodology (FRAGAL). In a similar study, FRAGAL has also identified a novel half-a- tetratricopeptide (HAT) motif (E=11e-4), a helical repeat motif implicated in various aspects of RNA metabolism, in Utp6 from yeast. The characteristic three aromatic residues with conserved spacing are observed in this new HAT repeat, further strengthening my claim. The reference and target sequences are sliced into overlapping fragments of equal parameterized lengths. All pairs of fragments in the reference and target proteins are aligned, and the gap penalties are adjusted to discourage gaps in the middle of the alignment. The results of the best matches are sorted based on differing criteria to aid the detection of known and putative sequences. The source code for FRAGAL results on these sequences is available at https://github.com/sanchak/FragalCode, while the database can be accessed at www.sanchak.com/fragal.html.",2013,"Sandeep Chakraborty, Sandeep Chakraborty"
Responses of Drosophila melanogaster to atypical oxygen atmospheres,21241703,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.01.005,"We examined physiological phenotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in hypoxic to hyperoxic atmospheres. We performed measurements on life span or behavioural function in 5, 21, 40, 60, and 80% O(2), and combined this with literature data for 2% and 100% O(2). O(2) incubation resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of life span in both hypoxia and hyperoxia, though different measures of life span were affected differently. We also examined how behavioural and metabolic functions were affected by exposure to hyperoxia (up to 60% O(2)). Climbing behaviour was measured as a fast (4 s) and slow (55 s) response in a negative geotaxis assay. In normoxia, both measures of climbing response declined exponentially until disappearing completely. Interestingly, survivorship was very high until the loss of climbing ability, after which it dropped rapidly. This pattern appeared accelerated in 40% O(2). However, while flies in 60% O(2) also apparently lost their fast climbing ability immediately prior to the drop in survivorship, they maintained considerable climbing ability over the longer trial. Metabolism, measured by CO(2) release, did not change with age in normoxic flies, but was significantly lower in flies exposed to hyperoxia, particularly as the flies aged. There was, however, a slight increase in water loss rate with age in normoxia, while in hyperoxia, water loss was reduced. Uniquely, the water loss rates of flies in 60% O(2) doubled immediately prior to the end of their life span. Because ageing results in generally irreversible functional declines, we examined if functional declines in hyperoxia (60% O(2)) were also irreversible, or whether some functioning could recover after a return to normoxia. After 7 days of recovery, water loss rates decreased, CO(2) exhalation slightly increased, and climbing ability was partially recovered. Therefore, the effect of O(2) on D. melanogaster function is non-linear, may be reversible, and may include unique phenotypes that arise at some O(2) concentrations, and not others.",2011,"Dimitri A Skandalis, Jeffrey A Stuart, Glenn J Tattersall, Dimitri A Skandalis, Jeffrey A Stuart, Glenn J Tattersall"
Functional characterization of a second porin isoform in Drosophila melanogaster. DmPorin2 forms voltage-independent cation-selective pores,15054101,10.1074/jbc.M310572200,"Mitochondrial porins or voltage-dependent anion-selective channels are channel-forming proteins mainly found in the mitochondrial outer membrane. Genome sequencing of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster revealed the presence of three additional porin-like genes. No functional information was available for the different gene products. In this work we have studied the function of the gene product closest to the known Porin gene (CG17137 coding for DmPorin2). Its coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant DmPorin2 protein is able to form channels similar to those formed by DmPorin1 reconstituted in artificial membranes. Furthermore, DmPorin2 is clearly voltage-independent and cation-selective, whereas its counterpart isoform 1 is voltage-dependent and anion-selective. Sequence comparison of the two porin isoforms indicates the exchange of four lysines in DmPorin1 for four glutamic acids in DmPorin2. We have mutated two of them (Glu-66 and Glu-163) to lysines to investigate their role in the functional features of the pore. The mutants E163K and E66K/E163K are endowed with an almost full inversion of the ion selectivity. Both single mutations partially restore the voltage dependence of the pore. We found that an additional effect with the double mutant E66K/E163K was the restoration of voltage dependence. Protein structure predictions highlight a 16 beta-strand pattern, typical for porins. In a three-dimensional model of DmPorin2, Glu-66 and Glu-163 are close to the rim of the channel, on two opposite sides. DmPorin2 is expressed in all the fly tissues and in all the developmental stages tested. Our main conclusions are as follows. 1) The CG17137 gene may express a porin with a functional role in D. melanogaster. 2) We have identified two amino acids of major relevance for the voltage dependence of the porin pore.",2004,"Rita Aiello, Angela Messina, Bettina Schiffler, Roland Benz, Gianluca Tasco, Rita Casadio, Vito De Pinto, Rita Aiello, Angela Messina, Bettina Schiffler, Roland Benz, Gianluca Tasco, Rita Casadio, Vito De Pinto"
The relationship between dipeptidase activity variation and larval viability in Drosophila melanogaster,3121435,,"The enzyme dipeptidase-A (DIP-A) in Drosophila melanogaster is coded by a second chromosome locus that is polymorphic for three allozymes in natural populations. DIP-A appears to be the only enzyme in D. melanogaster capable of hydrolyzing the dipeptide glycyl-L-isoleucine, since flies homozygous for null alleles at this locus have no detectable glycyl-L-isoleucine-ase activity. DIP-A activity occurs in many tissues and throughout development, but is particularly high in the larval midgut, suggesting an important role in protein digestion. These observations suggested an experimental design for investigating the adaptive significance of genetic variation in DIP-A activity. Fitness components of DIP-A variants could be estimated and compared under two environmental conditions (defined diets under axenic conditions). In the restrictive environment, the essential amino acid L-isoleucine is provided only in the form of glycyl-L-isoleucine, whereas in the permissive environment, L-isoleucine is provided in free form. We predicted that DIP-A activity would be essential in the restrictive, but not in the permissive environment. The results reported here clearly contradict this prediction. Two stocks homozygous for DIP-A null alleles from different geographic locations are each viable on the restrictive diet. Furthermore, relative viability experiments in which null allele larvae compete with larvae having DIP-A activity provide no evidence for even a partial reduction in egg to adult survival on the restrictive diet. Apparently, the null allele larvae have some alternative mechanism for obtaining L-isoleucine from the dipeptide, even though no glycyl-L-isoleucine-ase activity can be detected in vitro. These results, along with the viability of null alleles for many other enzymes, support the idea that eukaryotes have an intricate network of alternative biochemical pathways through which the same necessary function may be achieved. Such ""buffering capacity"" makes it very difficult to analyze the effects of enzyme variants on fitness components.",1987,"K Hiraizumi, C C Laurie, K Hiraizumi, C C Laurie"
A family of oligo-adenylate-terminated transposable sequences in Drosophila melanogaster,6310126,10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80071-0,"Five members of the F family of transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster have been characterized. Together with earlier work, these experiments lead to the following conclusions. There are about 50 copies of F elements in the genome located at about 25 euchromatic sites and in the chromocenter. Three of the cloned F elements have a length of 4.7 X 10(3) bases, the other two are truncated at their left ends by 0.4 X 10(3) and 1.3 X 10(3) bases, the other two are truncated at their left ends by 0.4 X 10(3) and 1.3 X 10(3) bases. The shortest F element has been found in a recently arisen revertant of the white ivory mutation. All F elements terminate at their right ends in a stretch of 12 to 30 A residues. A polyadenylation signal (A-A-T-A-A-A) precedes this terminus. Analysis of homologous DNA regions derived from two different strains of D. melanogaster containing F elements (filled sites) or lacking F elements (empty sites) showed that F insertions lead to the generation of target site duplications of 8 to 13 base-pairs. The five target sites analyzed differ in sequence but show a low level of homology. F elements do not contain internal repeats and, in particular, they lack the terminal redundancy characteristic of many other transposable elements. We compare F elements with other oligo(A)-terminated sequences, specifically the Alu sequences and processed pseudogenes of mammals. The presence of an oligo(A) stretch and of a polyadenylation signal raises the possibility that F elements transpose by a mechanism that involves transcription and reverse transcription followed by reinsertion into the genome.",1983,"P P Di Nocera, M E Digan, I B Dawid, P P Di Nocera, M E Digan, I B Dawid"

Characterization of a cdc14 null allele in Drosophila melanogaster,29945873,10.1242/bio.035394,"Cdc14 is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine phosphatase. Originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a cell cycle regulator, its role in other eukaryotic organisms remains unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, Cdc14 is encoded by a single gene, thus facilitating its study. We found that Cdc14 expression is highest in the testis of adult flies and that cdc14 null flies are viable. cdc14 null female and male flies do not display altered fertility. cdc14 null males, however, exhibit decreased sperm competitiveness. Previous studies have shown that Cdc14 plays a role in ciliogenesis during zebrafish development. In Drosophila, sensory neurons are ciliated. We found that the Drosophila cdc14 null mutants have defects in chemosensation and mechanosensation as indicated by decreased avoidance of repellant substances and decreased response to touch. In addition, we show that cdc14 null mutants have defects in lipid metabolism and resistance to starvation.

In this study, the presence and distribution of this protein, in comparison with that of paramyosin and myosin, has been examined in the striated muscle (tergal depressor of trochanter) of Drosophila melanogaster, and the obliquely striated muscle (body wall) and the smooth muscle (outer layer of the pseudoheart) of the earthworm Eisenia foetida by means of immunocytochemical electron microscopic study and Western blot analysis miniparamyosin paramyosin and myosin antibodies from Drosophila. In the striated muscle of D. melanogaster, the three proteins were immunolocalized along the length of the thick filaments (A-bands). The distribution of immunogold particles along these filaments was uniform. The relative proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin (calculated by counting the number of immunogold particles) were: 1/10/68. In the obliquely striated muscle of E. foetida, immunoreactions to the three proteins were also found in the thick filaments, and the relative proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin were 1/2.4/6.9. However, whereas the distribution of both myosin and miniparamyosin along the thick filament length was uniform, paramyosin immunolabelling was more abundant in the extremes of thick filaments (the outer zones of A-bands in the obliquely striated muscle), where the thick filaments become thinner than in the centre (the central zone of A-bands), where these filaments are thicker. The relative proportions of paramyosin in the outer and of paramyosin in the central zones of A-bands were 4/1. This irregular distribution of paramyosin along the thick filament length might be actual but it may also be explained by the fusiform shape of thick filaments in the earthworm: assuming that paramyosin is covered by myosin, paramyosin antigens would be more exposed in the tips than in the centre of thick filaments. If miniparamyosin is, in turn, covered by paramyosin, the exposure of miniparamyosin antigens would be low even in the tips of thick filaments, and this might explain the scanty immunoreaction observed for this protein and the absence of a higher number of immunogold particles in the extremes of thick filaments. The distribution of the three proteins in the earthworm smooth muscle was as in the obliquely striated muscle, although the proportions miniparamyosin/paramyosin/myosin were 1/1.5/5.2; this is, immunoreactions to paramyosin and miniparamyosin were lower than in the obliquely striated muscle.",1997,"M Royuela, B Fraile, M Cervera, R Paniagua, M Royuela, B Fraile, M Cervera, R Paniagua"

The Global Transcription Factor Lrp Is both Essential for and Inhibitory to Xenorhabdus nematophila Insecticidal Activity,28411220,10.1128/AEM.00185-17,"In the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila, cell-to-cell variation in the abundance of the Lrp transcription factor leads to virulence modulation; low Lrp levels are associated with a virulent phenotype and suppression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in Manduca sexta insects, while cells that lack lrp or express high Lrp levels are virulence attenuated and elicit AMP expression. To better understand the basis of these phenotypes, we examined X. nematophila strains expressing fixed Lrp levels. Unlike the lrp-null mutant, the high-lrp strain is fully virulent in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that these two strains have distinct underlying causes of virulence attenuation in M. sexta Indeed, the lrp-null mutant was defective in cytotoxicity against M. sexta hemocytes relative to that in the high-lrp and low-lrp strains. Further, supernatant derived from the lrp-null mutant but not from the high-lrp strain was defective in inhibiting weight gain when fed to 1st instar M. sexta These data suggest that contributors to the lrp-null mutant virulence attenuation phenotype are the lack of Lrp-dependent cytotoxic and extracellular oral growth inhibitory activities, which may be particularly important for virulence in D. melanogaster In contrast, the high-Lrp strain was sensitive to the antimicrobial peptide cecropin, had a transient survival defect in M. sexta, and had reduced extracellular levels of insecticidal activity, measured by injection of supernatant into 4th instar M. sexta Thus, high-lrp strain virulence attenuation may be explained by its hypersensitivity to M. sexta host immunity and its inability to secrete one or more insecticidal factors.IMPORTANCE Adaptation of a bacterial pathogen to host environments can be achieved through the coordinated regulation of virulence factors that can optimize success under prevailing conditions. In the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila, the global transcription factor Lrp is necessary for virulence when injected into Manduca sexta or Drosophila melanogaster insect hosts. However, high levels of Lrp, either naturally occurring or artificially induced, cause attenuation of X. nematophila virulence in M. sexta but not D. melanogaster Here, we present evidence suggesting that the underlying cause of high-Lrp-dependent virulence attenuation in M. sexta is hypersensitivity to host immune responses and decreased insecticidal activity and that high-Lrp virulence phenotypes are insect host specific. This knowledge suggests that X. nematophila faces varied challenges depending on the type of insect host it infects and that its success in these environments depends on Lrp-dependent control of a multifactorial virulence repertoire.",2017,"?ngel M Casanova-Torres, Upasana Shokal, Neta Morag, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Heidi Goodrich-Blair, ?ngel M Casanova-Torres, Upasana Shokal, Neta Morag, Ioannis Eleftherianos, Heidi Goodrich-Blair"

The Role of Lipid Competition for Endosymbiont-Mediated Protection against Parasitoid Wasps in Drosophila,27406568,10.1128/mBio.01006-16,"Insects commonly harbor facultative bacterial endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia and Spiroplasma species, that are vertically transmitted from mothers to their offspring. These endosymbiontic bacteria increase their propagation by manipulating host reproduction or by protecting their hosts against natural enemies. While an increasing number of studies have reported endosymbiont-mediated protection, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this protection. Here, we analyze the mechanisms underlying protection from parasitoid wasps in Drosophila melanogaster mediated by its facultative endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii Our results indicate that S. poulsonii exerts protection against two distantly related wasp species, Leptopilina boulardi and Asobara tabida S. poulsonii-mediated protection against parasitoid wasps takes place at the pupal stage and is not associated with an increased cellular immune response. In this work, we provide three important observations that support the notion that S. poulsonii bacteria and wasp larvae compete for host lipids and that this competition underlies symbiont-mediated protection. First, lipid quantification shows that both S. poulsonii and parasitoid wasps deplete D. melanogaster hemolymph lipids. Second, the depletion of hemolymphatic lipids using the Lpp RNA interference (Lpp RNAi) construct reduces wasp success in larvae that are not infected with S. poulsonii and blocks S. poulsonii growth. Third, we show that the growth of S. poulsonii bacteria is not affected by the presence of the wasps, indicating that when S. poulsonii is present, larval wasps will develop in a lipid-depleted environment. We propose that competition for host lipids may be relevant to endosymbiont-mediated protection in other systems and could explain the broad spectrum of protection provided.

      Virtually all insects, including crop pests and disease vectors, harbor facultative bacterial endosymbionts. They are vertically transmitted from mothers to their offspring, and some protect their host against pathogens. Here, we studied the mechanism of protection against parasitoid wasps mediated by the Drosophila melanogaster endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii Using genetic manipulation of the host, we provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that competition for host lipids underlies S. poulsonii-mediated protection against parasitoid wasps. We propose that lipid competition-based protection may not be restricted to Spiroplasma bacteria but could also apply other endosymbionts, notably Wolbachia bacteria, which can suppress human disease-causing viruses in insect hosts.",2016,"Juan C Paredes, Jeremy K Herren, Fanny Schüpfer, Bruno Lemaitre, Juan C Paredes, Jeremy K Herren, Fanny Schüpfer, Bruno Lemaitre"
The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of an insect calcitonin-like diuretic peptide stimulates V-ATPase activity in fruit fly Malpighian tubules,11316500,,"The Drosophila melanogaster homologue of an insect calcitonin-like diuretic hormone was identified in a BLAST search of the Drosophila genome database. The predicted 31-residue amidated peptide (D. melanogaster DH31; Drome-DH31) was synthesised and tested for activity on fruit fly Malpighian tubules. It increases tubule secretion by approximately 35 % of the response obtained with a myokinin from the housefly Musca domestica (muscakinin; Musdo-K) and has an EC50 of 4.3 nmol x l(-1). The diuretic activities of Drome-DH31 and Musdo-K were additive when tested at threshold and supra-maximal concentrations, which suggests that they target different transport processes. In support of this, Drome-DH31 increased the rate of secretion by tubules held in bathing fluid with a reduced Cl- concentration, whereas Musdo-K did so only in the presence of Drome-DH31. Stimulation with Drome-DH31 increased the lumen-positive transepithelial potential in the main secretory segment of the tubule. This was attributed to activation of an apical electrogenic proton-translocating V-ATPase in principal cells, since it was associated with hyperpolarisation of the apical membrane potential and acidification of secreted urine by 0.25 pH units. Exogenous 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased tubule secretion to the same extent as Drome-DH31 and, when tested together with the diuretic peptide, their activities were not additive. Stimulation with Drome-DH31 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cyclic AMP production by tubules incubated in saline containing 0.5 mmol x l(-1) 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, whereas cyclic GMP production was unchanged. Taken together, the data are consistent with Drome-DH31 activating an apical membrane V-ATPase via cyclic AMP. Since the K+ concentration of the secreted urine was unchanged, it is likely that Drome-DH31 has an equal effect on K+ and Na+ entry across the basolateral membrane.",2001,"G M Coast, S G Webster, K M Schegg, S S Tobe, D A Schooley, G M Coast, S G Webster, K M Schegg, S S Tobe, D A Schooley"
Transcription of the Drosophila melanogaster 5S RNA gene requires an upstream promoter and four intragenic sequence elements,3130565,10.1128/mcb.8.3.1266,"Linker-scanning (LS) mutations were constructed spanning the length of the Drosophila melanogaster 5S RNA gene. In vitro transcription analysis of the LS 5S DNAs revealed five transcription control regions. One control region essential for transcription initiation was identified in the 5'-flanking sequence. The major sequence determinants of this upstream promoter region were located between coordinates -39 and -26 (-30 region), but important sequences extended to the transcription start site at position 1. Since mutations in the upstream promoter did not alter the ability of 5S DNA to sequester transcription factors into a stable transcription complex, it appears that this control region involved the interaction of RNA polymerase III. Active 5S DNA transcription additionally required the four intragenic control regions (ICRs) located between coordinates 3 and 18 (ICR I), 37 and 44 (ICR II), 48 and 61 (ICR III), and 78 and 98 (ICR IV). LS mutations in each ICR decreased the ability of 5S DNA to sequester transcription factors. ICR III, ICR IV, and the spacer sequence between were similar in sequence and position to the determinant elements of the multipartite ICR of Xenopus 5S DNA. The importance of ICR III and ICR IV in transcription initiation and in sequestering transcription factors suggests the presence of an activity in D. melanogaster similar to transcription factor TFIIIA of Xenopus laevis and HeLa cells. Transcription initiation of Drosophila 5S DNA was not eliminated by LS mutations in the spacer region even though these mutations reduced the ability of the TFIIIA-like activity to bind. The previously unidentified control regions ICR I and ICR II appear to be important for the interaction of a transcription factor activity, or multiple-factor activities, distinct from the TFIIIA-like activity. The interaction of this activity with ICR I directed the selection of the transcription start site.",1988,"S J Sharp, A D Garcia, S J Sharp, A D Garcia"

Quantifying Drosophila adults with the use of a smartphone,32917765,10.1242/bio.054452,"A method for automation of imago quantifying and fecundity assessment in Drosophila with the use of mobile devices running Android operating system is proposed. The traditional manual method of counting the progeny takes a long time and limits the opportunity of making large-scale experiments. Thus, the development of computerized methods that would allow us to automatically make a quantitative estimate of D. melanogaster fecundity is an urgent requirement. We offer a modification of the mobile application SeedCounter that analyzes images of objects placed on a standard sheet of paper for an automatic calculation of D. melanogaster offspring or quantification of adult flies in any other kind of experiment. The relative average error in estimates of the number of flies by mobile app is about 2% in comparison with the manual counting and the processing time is 6 times shorter. Study of the effects of imaging conditions on accuracy of flies counting showed that lighting conditions do not significantly affect this parameter, and higher accuracy can be achieved using high-resolution smartphone cameras (8 Mpx and more).

Polyglutamine expansion in Drosophila: thermal stress and Hsp70 as selective agents,17536173,10.1007/s12038-007-0053-9,"Repetitive DNA sequences that encode polyglutamine tracts are prone to expansion and cause highly deleterious phenotypes of neurodegeneration. Despite this tendency,polyglutamine tracts (""polyQs"") are conserved features of eukaryotic genomes. PolyQs are the most frequent protein-coding homotypic repeat in insect genomes, and are found predominantly in genes encoding transcription factors conserved from Drosophila through human. Although highly conserved across species, polyQ lengths vary widely within species. In D. melanogaster, polyQs in 25 genes have more alleles and higher heterozygosity than all other poly-amino acid tracts. The heat shock protein Hsp70 is a principal suppressor of polyQ expansions and may play a key role in modulating the phenotypes of the alleles that encode them. Hsp70 also promotes tolerance of natural thermal stress in Drosophila and diverse organisms,a role which may deplete the chaperone from buffering against polyQ toxicity. Thus in stressful environments, natural selection against long polyQ alleles more prone to expansion and deleterious phenotypes may be more effective. This hypothesis can be tested by measuring the phenotypic interactions between Hsp70 and polyQ transgenes in D. melanogaster undergoing natural thermal stress, an approach which integrates comparative genomics with experimental and ecological genetics.",2007,"Brian R Bettencourt, Catherine C Hogan, Mario Nimali, Brian R Bettencourt, Catherine C Hogan, Mario Nimali"
Alpha-ketoglutarate reduces ethanol toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster by enhancing alcohol dehydrogenase activity and antioxidant capacity,27788775,10.1016/j.alcohol.2016.07.009,"Ethanol at low concentrations (<4%) can serve as a food source for fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, whereas at higher concentrations it may be toxic. In this work, protective effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) against ethanol toxicity were studied. Food supplementation with 10-mM AKG alleviated toxic effects of 8% ethanol added to food, and improved fly development. Two-day-old adult flies, reared on diet containing both AKG and ethanol, possessed higher alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity as compared with those reared on control diet or diet with ethanol only. Native gel electrophoresis data suggested that this combination diet might promote post-translational modifications of ADH protein with the formation of a highly active ADH form. The ethanol-containing diet led to significantly higher levels of triacylglycerides stored in adult flies, and this parameter was not altered by AKG supplement. The influence of diet on antioxidant defenses was also assessed. In ethanol-fed flies, catalase activity was higher in males and the levels of low molecular mass thiols were unchanged in both sexes compared to control values. Feeding on a mixture of AKG and ethanol did not affect catalase activity but caused a higher level of low molecular mass thiols compared to ethanol-fed flies. It can be concluded that both a stimulation of some components of antioxidant defense and the increase in ADH activity may be responsible for the protective effects of AKG diet supplementation in combination with ethanol. The results suggest that AKG might be useful as a treatment option to neutralize toxic effects of excessive ethanol intake and to improve the physiological state of D. melanogaster and other animals, potentially including humans.",2016,"Maria M Bayliak, Halyna V Shmihel, Maria P Lylyk, Kenneth B Storey, Volodymyr I Lushchak, Maria M Bayliak, Halyna V Shmihel, Maria P Lylyk, Kenneth B Storey, Volodymyr I Lushchak"
Evaluation of antioxidant and mutagenic activities of honey-sweetened cashew apple nectar,23973191,10.1016/j.fct.2013.08.026,"In vitro chemical properties and antioxidant potential and in vivo mutagenic activity of honey-sweetened cashew apple nectar (HSCAN), a beverage produced from the cashew pseudo-fruit (Anacardium occidentale L.) and of its constituents were assessed. Analytical procedures were carried out to investigate the honey used in the HSCAN preparation, and the results observed are in accordance with Brazilian legal regulations, except for diastase number. HSCAN and pulp were investigated for ascorbic acid, carotenoid, anthocyanin and total phenolic contents, and both showed high acid ascorbic concentrations. Antioxidant capacity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and/or β-carotene/linoleic acid systems were applied and demonstrated a weak antioxidant capacity of honey and HSCAN, but cashew apple pulp demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. A weakly positive mutagenic effect of cashew pulp 20% was observed using the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster only in the high-bioactivation (HB) cross. On the contrary, HSCAN was not mutagenic in both standard and high bioactivation crosses. HSCAN exhibited slight antioxidant activity, which could be associated with the high amount of ascorbic acid found in the samples evaluated. The beverage prepared did not induce DNA damage in somatic cells of D. melanogaster, which means that it is neither mutagenic nor recombinagenic in this test system.",2013,"Robson Alves da Silva, Rafael Rodrigues Dihl, Débora Nascimento e Santos, Bianca Regina Ribas de Abreu, Alessandro de Lima, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade, Mauricio Lehmann, Robson Alves da Silva, Rafael Rodrigues Dihl, Débora Nascimento e Santos, Bianca Regina Ribas de Abreu, Alessandro de Lima, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues de Andrade, Mauricio Lehmann"
Response to selection for rapid chill-coma recovery in Drosophila melanogaster: physiology and life-history traits,16089033,10.1017/s0016672304007281,"Resistance to low temperatures can vary markedly among invertebrate species and is directly related to their distribution. Despite the ecological importance of cold resistance this trait has rarely been studied genetically, mainly because low and variable fitness of offspring from cold-stressed mothers makes it difficult to undertake selection experiments and compare cold resistance of parents and offspring. One measure of cold resistance that varies geographically in Drosophila melanogaster and that is amenable to genetic analysis is chill-coma recovery. Three replicate lines of D. melanogaster were selected every second generation, for over 30 generations, for decreased recovery time following exposure to 0 degrees C. Correlated responses were scored to characterize underlying physiological traits and to investigate interactions with other traits. Lines responded rapidly to the intermittent selection regime with realized heritabilities varying from 33% to 46%. Selected lines showed decreased recovery time after exposure to a broad range of low temperatures and also had a lower mortality following a more severe cold shock, indicating that a general mechanism underlying cold resistance had been selected. The selection response was independent of plastic changes in cold resistance because the selected lines maintained their ability to harden (i.e. a short-term exposure to cool temperature resulted in decreased recovery time in subsequent chill-coma assays). Changes in cold resistance were not associated with changes in resistance to high temperature exposure, and selected lines showed no changes in wing size, development time or viability. However, there was a decrease in longevity in the selected lines due to an earlier onset of ageing. These results indicate that chill-coma recovery can be rapidly altered by selection, as long as selection is undertaken every second generation to avoid carry-over effects, and suggest that lower thermal limits can be shifted towards increased cold resistance independently of upper thermal limits and without tradeoffs in many life-history traits.",2005,"Alisha R Anderson, Ary A Hoffmann, Stephen W McKechnie, Alisha R Anderson, Ary A Hoffmann, Stephen W McKechnie"
Cellularization in Drosophila melanogaster is disrupted by the inhibition of rho activity and the activation of Cdc42 function,9851849,10.1006/dbio.1998.9061,"Regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics is essential for cell shape change and morphogenesis. Drosophila melanogaster embryos offer a well-defined system for observing alterations in the cytoskeleton during the process of cellularization, a specialized form of cytokinesis. During cellularization, the actomyosin cytoskeleton forms a hexagonal array and drives invagination of the plasma membrane between the nuclei located at the cortex of the syncytial blastoderm. Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins are members of the Rho subfamily of Ras-related G proteins that are involved in the formation and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton throughout phylogeny and in D. melanogaster. To investigate how Rho subfamily activity affects the cytoskeleton during cellularization stages, embryos were microinjected with C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum or with wild-type, constitutively active, or dominant negative versions of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins. C3 exoenzyme ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho with high specificity, whereas constitutively active dominant mutations remain in the activated GTP-bound state to activate downstream effectors. Dominant negative mutations likely inhibit endogenous small G protein activity by sequestering exchange factors. Of the 10 agents microinjected, C3 exoenzyme, constitutively active Cdc42, and dominant negative Rho have a specific and indistinguishable effect: the actomyosin cytoskeleton is disrupted, cellularization halts, and embryogenesis arrests. Time-lapse video records of DIC imaged embryos show that nuclei in injected regions move away from the cortex of the embryo, thereby phenocopying injections of cytochalasin or antimyosin. Rhodamine phalloidin staining reveals that the actin-based hexagonal array normally seen during cellularization is disrupted in a dose-dependent fashion. Additionally, DNA stain reveals that nuclei in the microinjected embryos aggregate in regions that correspond to actin disruption. These embryos halt in cellularization and do not proceed to gastrulation. We conclude that Rho activity and Cdc42 regulation are required for cytoskeletal function in actomyosin-driven furrow canal formation and nuclear positioning.",1998,"J M Crawford, N Harden, T Leung, L Lim, D P Kiehart, J M Crawford, N Harden, T Leung, L Lim, D P Kiehart"
THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW MUTATIONS TO GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION FOR FITNESS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28565671,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03619.x,"Many studies have documented the existence of genotype-environment interaction (GEI) for traits closely related to fitness in natural populations. A type of GEI that is commonly observed is changes in the fitness ranking of genetic groups (families, clones, or inbred lines) in different environments. We refer to such changes in ranking as crossing of reaction norms for fitness. A common interpretation of crossing of reaction norms for fitness is that selection favors different alleles in the different environments (i.e., that ""trade-offs"" exist). If this is the case, selection could maintain genetic variation, and even lead to reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different environments. Even if the same alleles are favored in every environment, however, deleterious mutations that vary in the magnitude of their effect depending on environment could cause reaction norms for fitness to cross. If deleterious mutations with environment-dependent effects are responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness in natural populations, it should be possible to observe crossing of reaction norms for fitness among otherwise genetically identical lines bearing newly arisen spontaneous mutations. We examined the contribution of new mutations to GEI for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. Eighteen lines were derived from a common, highly inbred base stock, and maintained at a population size of 10 pairs for over 200 generations, to allow them to accumulate spontaneous mutations. Because of the small population size of the lines, selection against mildly deleterious mutations should have been relatively ineffective. The lines were tested for productivity (number of surviving adult progeny from a standard number of parents) in five different environmental treatments, comprising different food media, temperatures, and levels of competition. The lines showed highly significant GEI for productivity, owing largely to considerable changes in ranking in the different environments. We conclude that mutations that are deleterious on average, but whose quantitative effects depend on environment, could be responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness that has been observed in samples of D. melanogaster from the wild.",1996,"James D Fry, Stefanie L Heinsohn, Trudy F C Mackay, James D Fry, Stefanie L Heinsohn, Trudy F C Mackay"
Mutational analysis of N-linked glycosylation of esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster,8813053,10.1007/BF02407020,"The primary sequence of the esterase 6 (EST6) enzyme of Drosophila melanogaster contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites, at residues 21, 399, 435, and 485. Here we determine the extent to which EST6 is glycosylated and how the glycosylation affects the biochemistry and physiology of the enzyme. We have abolished each of the four potential glycosylation sites by replacing the required Asn residues with Gln by in vitro mutagenesis. Five mutant genes were made, four containing mutations of each site individually and the fifth site containing all four mutations. Germline transformation was used to introduce the mutant genes into a strain of D. melanogaster null for EST6. Electrophoretic and Western blot comparisons of the mutant strains and wild-type controls showed that each of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the wild-type protein is glycosylated. However, the fourth site is not utilized on all EST6 molecules, resulting in two molecular forms of the enzyme. Digestion with specific endoglycosidases showed that the glycan attached at the second site is of the high-mannose type, while the other three sites carry more complex oligosaccharides. The thermostability of the enzyme is not affected by abolition of the first, third, or fourth glycosylation sites but is reduced by abolition of the second site. Anomalously, abolition of all four sites together does not reduce thermostability. Quantitative comparisons of EST6 activities showed that abolition of glycosylation does not affect the secretion of the enzyme into the male sperm ejaculatory duct, its transfer to the female vagina during mating, or its subsequent translocation into her hemolymph. However, the activity of the mutant enzymes does not persist in the female's hemolymph for as long as wild-type esterase 6. The latter effect may compromise the role of the transferred enzyme in stimulating egg-laying and delaying receptivity to remating.",1996,"M A Myers, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott, M A Myers, M J Healy, J G Oakeshott"
The genomic organization of the region containing the Drosophila melanogaster rpL7a (Surf-3) gene differs from those of the mammalian and avian Surfeit loci,7739520,10.1128/mcb.15.5.2367,"The Surf-3 gene of the unusually tight mouse Surfeit locus gene cluster has been identified as the highly conserved ribosomal protein gene L7a (rpL7a). The topography and juxtaposition of the Surfeit locus genes are conserved for the 600 million years of divergent evolution between mammals and birds. This suggests cis interaction and/or coregulation of the genes and suggests that, within this locus, gene organization plays an important role in gene expression. The further evolutionary conservation of the organization of the Surfeit locus was investigated. A cDNA encoding the Drosophila melanogaster homolog of the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was cloned, was shown to be present as a single copy, and was expressed constitutively at high levels throughout development. Genomic cosmid clones encompassing the gene and its surrounding DNA were isolated. The gene was determined to have five introns, of which two were located in the 5' untranslated region of the gene. The remaining three introns had splice sites at positions equivalent to those found in the Surf-3/rpL7a mammalian homologs. S1 analysis and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends both confirmed the start of transcription to occur in a polypyrimidine tract in the absence of a TATA box in the promoter. The genomic region around the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was analyzed by low-stringency hybridization with murine Surfeit gene probes, by partial sequence analysis, and by hybridization of fragments to Northern (RNA) blots. No homologs of other members of the Surfeit gene cluster were detected in close proximity to the D. melanogaster Surf-3/rpL7a gene. However, a gene which was detected directly 3' to the Surf-3/rpL7a gene was shown to encode a homolog of a mammalian serine-pyruvate aminotransferase.",1995,"N Armes, M Fried, N Armes, M Fried"
Age-dependent expression profiles of two adaptogenic systems and thermotolerance in Drosophila melanogaster,32040825,10.1007/s12192-020-01074-4,"Here, we monitored the expression of three genes (hsp70, hsp22, and hsf1) involved in heat shock response in Drosophila melanogaster in males and females of different age. Also, we investigated age- and sex-dependent expression of three major genes participating in the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (cse, cbs, and mst), implicated in stress resistance and aging. In addition to the control strain, we monitored the expression of all of these genes in a cbs knockout strain (cbs-/-) generated using the CRISPR technique. The tested strains differ in the induction capacities of the studied genes. Relative to the control strain, under normal conditions, the cbs-/- strain expresses all of the studied genes more abundantly, especially hsp22. In the control strain, aging leads to a dramatic increase in hsp22 synthesis, whereas in the cbs-/- strain, hsp22 induction is not pronounced. Furthermore, in 30-day-old cbs-/- flies, the constitutive expression of hsp70 and mst is decreased. Surprisingly, in the cbs-/- strain, we detected an upregulation of hsf1 transcription in the 30-day-old females. After heat shock in the control strain, hsp70 and hsp22 induction decreased with age in males and hsp22 decreased in females, while in the cbs-/- strain, a pronounced drop in the induction capacity of both hsp genes was seen in 30-day-old males and females. However, in most cases, the expression levels of hsf1 and H2S-producing genes do not exhibit pronounced changes depending on sex, age, or heat shock.

Genotoxic Assessment of the Dry Decoction of Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemão (Anacardiaceae) Leaves in Somatic Cells of Drosophila melanogaster by the Comet and SMART Assays,31489703,10.1002/em.22332,"Medicinal plants are worldwide used as an efficient treatment of many diseases. Myracrodruon urundeuva Allemão (Anacardiaceae) is widely used Brazilian folk medicine to treat inflammations and infections of the female genital tract, conditions of the stomach and throat, and to heal wounds on the skin and mucous membranes. Several pharmacological properties of extracts and compounds isolated from M. urundeuva are found in the literature, corroborating its uses as antiulcer and gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory and analgesic, as well as antimicrobial. Despite these many uses in traditional herbal medicine, there are few reports of its toxic-genetic effect. This work aimed to investigate the genotoxic and mutagenic potential in vivo of the dry decoction of M. urundeuva leaves on somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, through the Comet assay and somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART). Six concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 mg/mL) were studied after feeding individuals for 24 hr in culture medium hydrated with extracts of M. urundeuva. In the Comet assay, all concentrations showed a genotoxic effect significantly higher than the negative control group, treated with distilled water. The two highest concentrations were also superior to the positive control group, treated with cyclophosphamide (1 mg/mL). In the SMART, there was a mutagenic effect at all concentrations tested, with a clear dose-dependent relationship. Both recombination and mutation account for these mutagenic effects. The set of results indicate that the dry decoction of M. urundeuva leaves is genotoxic and mutagenic for D. melanogaster under the experimental conditions of this study. Environ. Mol.

Trichoderma atroviride from Predator to Prey: Role of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Tmk3 in Fungal Chemical Defense against Fungivory by Drosophila melanogaster Larvae,30389761,10.1128/AEM.01825-18,"The response to injury represents an important strategy for animals and plants to survive mechanical damage and predation. Plants respond to injury by activating a defense response that includes the production of an important variety of compounds that help them withstand predator attack and recover from mechanical injury (MI). Similarly, the filamentous fungus Trichoderma atroviride responds to MI by strongly modifying its transcriptional profile and producing asexual reproduction structures (conidia). Here, we analyzed whether the response to MI in T. atroviride is related to a possible predator defense mechanism from a metabolic perspective. We found that the production of specific groups of secondary metabolites increases in response to MI but is reduced after fungivory by Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We further show that fungivory results in repression of the expression of genes putatively involved in the regulation of secondary metabolite production in T. atroviride Activation of secondary metabolite production appears to depend on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Tmk3. Interestingly, D. melanogaster larvae preferred to feed on a tmk3 gene replacement mutant rather than on the wild-type strain. Consumption of the mutant strain, however, resulted in increased larval mortality.IMPORTANCE Fungi, like other organisms, have natural predators, including fungivorous nematodes and arthropods that use them as an important food source. Thus, they require mechanisms to detect and respond to injury. Trichoderma atroviride responds to mycelial injury by rapidly regenerating its hyphae and developing asexual reproduction structures. Whether this injury response is associated with attack by fungivorous insects is unknown. Therefore, determining the possible conservation of a defense mechanism to predation in T. atroviride and plants and elucidating the mechanisms involved in the establishment of this response is of major interest. Here, we describe the chemical response of T. atroviride to mechanical injury and fungivory and the role of a MAPK pathway in the regulation of this response.",2019,"Karina Atriztán-Hernández, Abigail Moreno-Pedraza, Robert Winkler, Therese Markow, Alfredo Herrera-Estrella, Karina Atriztán-Hernández, Abigail Moreno-Pedraza, Robert Winkler, Therese Markow, Alfredo Herrera-Estrella"

When analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-ion trap-time-of-flight (LCMS-IT-TOF), the gut contents of both crickets had nearly identical FAA composition, the major FAAs comprising N-linolenoyl-L-glutamic acid and N-linoleoyl-L-glutamic acid. There were also two previously uncharacterized FAAs that were thought to be hydroxylated derivatives of these glutamic acid conjugates, based on their observed fragmentation patterns. In addition to these four FAAs containing glutamic acid, N-linolenoyl-L-glutamine and a small amount of volicitin were detected. In D. melanogaster, N-linolenoyl-L-glutamic acid and N-linoleoyl-L-glutamic acid were the major FAAs found in larval extracts, while hydroxylated glutamic acid conjugates, volicitin and N-linolenoyl-L-glutamine, were detected as trace components. Although these FAAs were not found in ten of the insects studied here, their identification in two additional orders of insects suggests that FAAs are more common than previously reported and may have physiological roles in a wide range of insects besides caterpillars.",2007,"Naoko Yoshinaga, Takako Aboshi, Chihiro Ishikawa, Masao Fukui, Masami Shimoda, Ritsuo Nishida, Cameron G Lait, James H Tumlinson, Naoki Mori, Naoko Yoshinaga, Takako Aboshi, Chihiro Ishikawa, Masao Fukui, Masami Shimoda, Ritsuo Nishida, Cameron G Lait, James H Tumlinson, Naoki Mori"
Characterization of salicylate uptake across the basolateral membrane of the malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster,16934829,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.05.013,"The organic anion salicylate is a plant secondary metabolite that can protect plants against herbivores. Transport of salicylate across the basolateral membrane of the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster was studied using a radioisotope tracer technique. The uptake of [(14)C]salicylate by the Malpighian tubules was active, saturable and Na(+)-dependent; the maximum uptake rate (J(max)) and the half saturation concentration (K(t)) were 12.6 pmoltubule(-1)min(-1) and 30.7micromoll(-1), respectively. In contrast to organic anion transport by vertebrate renal tissues, salicylate uptake was not trans-stimulated by glutarate (0.01-1.0 mmoll(-1)) or cis-inhibited by high concentrations (5 mmoll(-1)) of various alpha-keto acids (glutaric acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, and citric acid). Changes in basolateral membrane potential or physiologically relevant changes in bathing saline pH did not affect the rate of [(14)C]salicylate uptake. Ring-structure monocarboxylic acids (benzoic acid, nicotinic acid, gentisic acid, unlabelled salicylic acid, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, probenecid, fluorescein, and P-aminohippuric acid) strongly inhibited [(14)C]salicylate uptake rate. In contrast, short-chain monocarboxylic acids had little (butyric acid) or no effect (lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and propionic acid). Our results suggest that salicylate uptake across the basolateral membrane of D. melanogaster Malpighian tubules is mediated by a non-electrogenic, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid-sensitive, Na(+):salicylate cotransport system.",2006,"Esau Ruiz-Sanchez, Michael J O'Donnell, Esau Ruiz-Sanchez, Michael J O'Donnell"
Genetic variability of sexual size dimorphism in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster: an isofemale-line approach,15133187,10.1007/BF02715810,"Most animal species exhibit sexual size dimorphism (SSD). SSD is a trait difficult to quantify for genetical purposes since it must be simultaneously measured on two kinds of individuals, and it is generally expressed either as a difference or as a ratio between sexes. Here we ask two related questions: What is the best way to describe SSD, and is it possible to conveniently demonstrate its genetic variability in a natural population? We show that a simple experimental design, the isofemale-line technique (full-sib families), may provide an estimate of genetic variability, using the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We consider two SSD indices, the female-male difference and the female/male ratio. For two size-related traits, wing and thorax length, we found that both SSD indices were normally distributed. Within each family, the variability of SSD was estimated by considering individual values in one sex (the female) with respect to the mean value in the other sex (the male). In a homogeneous sample of 30 lines of Drosophila melanogaster, both indices provided similar intraclass correlations, on average 0.21, significantly greater than zero but lower than those for the traits themselves: 0.50 and 0.36 for wing and thorax length respectively. Wing and thorax length were strongly positively correlated within each sex. SSD indices of wing and thorax length were also positively correlated, but to a lesser degree than for the traits themselves. For comparative evolutionary studies, the ratio between sexes seems a better index of SSD since it avoids scaling effects among populations or species, permits comparisons between different traits, and has an unambiguous biological significance. In the case of D. melanogaster grown at 25 degrees C, the average female/male ratios are very similar for the wing (1.16) and the thorax (1.15), and indicate that, on average, these size traits are 15-16% longer in females.",2003,"Jean R David, Patricia Gibert, Sandrine Mignon-Grasteau, Hélène Legout, Georges Pétavy, Catherine Beaumont, Brigitte Moreteau, Jean R David, Patricia Gibert, Sandrine Mignon-Grasteau, Hélène Legout, Georges Pétavy, Catherine Beaumont, Brigitte Moreteau"
Nucleotide variation of the Est-6 gene region in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster,14704175,,"We have investigated nucleotide polymorphism in the Est-6 gene region in four samples of Drosophila melanogaster derived from natural populations of East Africa (Zimbabwe), Europe (Spain), North America (California), and South America (Venezuela). There are two divergent sequence types in the North and South American samples, which are not perfectly (North America) or not at all (South America) associated with the Est-6 allozyme variation. Less pronounced or no sequence dimorphism occurs in the European and African samples, respectively. The level of nucleotide diversity is highest in the African sample, lower (and similar to each other) in the samples from Europe and North America, and lowest in the sample from South America. The extent of linkage disequilibrium is low in Africa (1.23% significant associations), but much higher in non-African populations (22.59, 21.45, and 37.68% in Europe, North America, and South America, respectively). Tests of neutrality with recombination are significant in non-African samples but not significant in the African sample. We propose that demographic history (bottleneck and admixture of genetically different populations) is the major factor shaping the nucleotide patterns in the Est-6 gene region. However, positive selection modifies the pattern: balanced selection creates elevated levels of nucleotide variation around functionally important (target) polymorphic sites (RsaI-/RsaI+ in the promoter region and F/S in the coding region) in both African and non-African samples; and directional selection, acting during the geographic expansion phase of D. melanogaster, creates an excess of very similar sequences (RsaI- and S allelic lineages, in the promoter and coding regions, respectively) in the non-African samples.",2003,"Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala, Evgeniy S Balakirev, Francisco J Ayala"
Separate control of anion and cation transport in malpighian tubules of Drosophila Melanogaster,8786336,,"Microelectrode measurements of basal, apical and transepithelial potentials in the Malpighian tubules of Drosophila melanogaster were obtained under a range of conditions in order to investigate whether each of the three main second messenger systems known to act in the tubules (cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and Ca2+) acted specifically on either cation or anion transport, or whether they activated both systems. Ion-selective microelectrode determinations of K+ concentration and pH of secreted fluid allowed the role of each signalling system to be analysed further. Stimulation with cyclic nucleotides markedly alters the potential profile across principal cells through the selective activation of an apical electrogenic V-ATPase. By contrast, manipulation of extracellular chloride levels, combined with stimulation with leucokinin, does not affect the potential profile across the principal cells, showing that chloride must pass through another route. The cell-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM was shown to suppress the action of leucokinins (insect peptides that induce rapid fluid secretion), but not those of cyclic AMP, the neuronally derived insect peptide cardioacceleratory peptide 2b (CAP2b) or its intracellular messenger cyclic GMP. This shows that leucokinins act through Ca2+ and not through cyclic nucleotides and that the cyclic nucleotide pathways do not co-activate the intracellular Ca2+ pathway to exert their effects. Taken together, these results show that leucokinin acts through intracellular Ca2+, independently of cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, to raise the chloride permeability of the epithelium. By contrast, either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP (upon CAP2b stimulation) acts on the electrogenic cation-transporting apical V-ATPase, with only a negligible effect on anion conductance and without perturbing intracellular [Ca2+]. There is thus a clear functional separation between the control pathways acting on cation and anion transport in the tubules. Given the evidence from D. melanogaster and other species that chloride does not pass through the principal cells, we speculate that these two pathways may also be physically separated within cell subtypes of the tubules.",1996,"M J O'Donnell, J A Dow, G R Huesmann, N J Tublitz, S H Maddrell, M J O'Donnell, J A Dow, G R Huesmann, N J Tublitz, S H Maddrell"
Osmometric behavior of Drosophila melanogaster embryos,2507227,10.1016/0011-2240(89)90070-9,"The osmometric behavior of Drosophila melanogaster embryos in permeabilized eggs was studied in a microscope diffusion chamber designed to impose a rapid change in osmotic environment at various temperatures. A numerical model of NaCl diffusion in the chamber predicted that radial variations in concentration arising from the presence of a thin film of solution at the top of the chamber were negligible. On the basis of transient electrical conductance measurements in the chamber, characteristic time constants for the change in concentration averaged over the chamber depth occupied by the eggs were 0.99, 0.77, and 0.60 min at 0, 10, and 20 degrees C, respectively. The chamber response was sufficiently rapid that the characteristic response of the embryo was not masked. Equilibrium volumetric behavior of the embryos indicated that they behaved as nearly ideal osmometers over the range of 0.256 to 2.000 osm, and followed the relation FVeq = 0.123C-1 + 0.541, where FVeq is equilibrium fractional volume and C is osmolality. Nonlinear regression of volumetric data during osmotic contraction yielded an average Lp of 0.722 micron/(min.atm) at 20 degrees C and an apparent activation energy delta E of 8.11 kcal/mol. The coefficients of variation in the Lp estimates among individual embryos were 38, 18, and 47% at 0, 10, and 20 degrees C, respectively. With the use of probability rules and a model for volumetric behavior during freezing, it was determined that the observed variability in Lp (assuming delta E is fixed) considerably broadens the transition range of cooling rates over which the predicted probability of intracellular ice formation goes from 0 to 1. However, experimental observations (21) show the actual transition range is even wider, indicating that there exist other important sources of variability which determine the event of ice formation in D. melanogaster embryos.",1989,"T T Lin, R E Pitt, P L Steponkus, T T Lin, R E Pitt, P L Steponkus"

Effect of bisphenol A on Drosophila melanogaster behavior--a new model for the studies on neurodevelopmental disorders,25660202,10.1016/j.bbr.2015.02.001,"Developmental disorders such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appear to have a complex etiology implicating both genetic and environmental factors. Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used chemical in the plastic containers and in the linings of food and beverage cans, has been suggested to play a possible causative role in some developmental disorders. Here, we report behavioral modifications in Drosophila melanogaster following early exposure to BPA, which may suggest BPA as an environmental risk factor for the behavioral impairments that are the basis of diagnosis of autism and ADHD. In an open field assay with perinatally BPA-exposed and vehicle-treated control Drosophila, different parameters of locomotion (distance traveled, walking speed, spatial movement, mobility, turn angle, angular velocity and meander) were analyzed using the ethovision software. We also examined the repetitive and social interaction behaviors in these flies. In an open field assay, we identified disturbances in the locomotion patterns of BPA-exposed Drosophila that may relate to the decision-making and the motivational state of the animal. An increase in repetitive behavior was observed as an increase in the grooming behavior of Drosophila following BPA exposure. Furthermore, we also observed abnormal social interaction by the BPA-exposed flies in a social setting. These results demonstrate the effect of the environmentally prevalent risk agent BPA on the behavior of Drosophila, and suggest the practicability and the ease of using Drosophila as a model in the studies of neurobehavioral developmental disorders.",2015,"Kulbir Kaur, Anne F Simon, Ved Chauhan, Abha Chauhan, Kulbir Kaur, Anne F Simon, Ved Chauhan, Abha Chauhan"

Role of MicroRNA Genes miR-1000 and miR-375 in Forming Olfactory Conditional Memory in Drosophila melanogaster,32013857,10.2174/2211536609666200204113403,"Background:
      
    

    
      Learning and memory are basic aspects in neurogenetics as most of the neurological disorders start with dementia or memory loss. Several genes associated with memory formation have been discovered. MicroRNA genes miR-1000 and miR-375 were reported to be associated with neural integration and glucose homeostasis in some insects and vertebrates. However, neuronal function of these genes is yet to be established in D. melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Objective:
      
    

    
      Possible role of miR-1000 and miR-375 in learning and memory formation in this fly has been explored in the present study.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Both appetitive and aversive olfactory conditional learning were tested in the miR-1000 and miR-375 knockout (KO) strains and compared with wild one. Five days old third instar larvae were trained by allowing them to be associated with an odor with reward (fructose) or punishment (salt). Then, the larvae were tested to calculate their preferences to the odor trained with. Learning index (LI) values and larval locomotion speed were calculated for all strains.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      No significant difference was observed for larval locomotion speed in mutant strains. Knockout strain of miR-1000 showed significant deficiency in both appetitive and aversive memory formation whereas miR-375 KO strain showed a significantly lower response only in appetitive one.

"Molecular characterizations of natalisin and its roles in modulating mating in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel)",27862548,10.1111/imb.12274,"Initially, natalisin (NTL) was identified from three holometabolous insect species, Drosophila melanogaster, Tribolium castaneum and Bombyx mori, and was documented to regulate reproductive behaviours in D. melanogaster and T. castaneum. In this study, we report the sequences of the NTL precursor and its receptor (NTLR) from an important agricultural pest, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). NTLR is a typical G-protein coupled receptor and phylogenetic analysis showed that B. dorsalis NTLR was closely related to insect natalisin receptors from other species. A functional assay of NTLR transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that it was activated by putative natalisin mature peptides in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50 ) at nanomolar or micromolar levels. As indicated by quantitative real-time PCR, both NTL and NTLR had the highest expression in the central nervous system of B. dorsalis compared with the other tested tissues. Three pairs of adult brain neurones of B. dorsalis were identified with immunohistochemical antibody staining against D. melanogaster NTL4, and in situ hybridization with specific DNA probes. Moreover, RNA interference mediated by double-stranded RNA injection in adults provided evidence for the important roles of NTL in regulating both male and female mating frequencies in this fly.",2017,"S-H Gui, H-B Jiang, X-Q Liu, L Xu, J-J Wang, S-H Gui, H-B Jiang, X-Q Liu, L Xu, J-J Wang"
The complete set of ribosomal proteins from the marine sponge Suberites domuncula,16229974,10.1016/j.gene.2005.08.015,"The siliceous marine sponge Suberites domuncula is a member of the most ancient and simplest extant phylum of multicellular animals-Porifera, which have branched off first from the common ancestor of all Metazoa. We have determined primary structures of 79 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) from S. domuncula: 32 proteins from the small ribosomal subunit and 47 proteins from the large ribosomal subunit. Only L39 and L41 polypeptides (51 and 25 residues long in rat, respectively) are missing. The sponge S. domuncula is, after nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and insect Drosophila melanogaster the third representative of invertebrates with known amino acid sequences of all r-proteins. The comparison of S. domuncula r-proteins with r-proteins from D. melanogaster, C. elegans, rat, Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed very interesting findings. The majority of the sponge r-proteins are more similar to their homologues from rat, than to those either from invertebrates C. elegans and D. melanogaster, or yeast and plant. With few exceptions, the overall sequence conservation between sponge and rat r-proteins is 80% or higher. The phylogenetic tree of concatenated r-proteins from 6 eukaryotic species (rooted with archaeal r-proteins) has the shortest branches connecting sponge and rat. Both model invertebrate organisms experienced recently accelerated evolution and therefore sponge r-proteins very probably better reflect structures of proteins in the ancestral metazoan ribosome, which changed only little during metazoan evolution.

Role of the male BmDSX protein in the sexual differentiation of Bombyx mori,15642090,10.1111/j.1525-142X.2005.05007.x,"The sex determination pathway is different between Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori in the initial signal. Here we show evidence that the sex determination pathway in B. mori is similar to that of D. melanogaster at the level of the terminal regulator, doublesex (dsx), which is essential for the proper differentiation of the sexually dimorphic somatic features of D. melanogaster. In B. mori, a homolog of dsx (Bmdsx) is expressed in various tissues, and its primary transcript is alternatively spliced in males and females to yield sex-specific mRNAs that encode male-specific (BmDSXM) and female-specific (BmDSXF) polypeptides. In the studies reported here, transgenic silkworms carrying a construct with a Bmdsx male cDNA placed under the control of either an hsp70 promoter or a Bombyx actin3 promoter were generated by piggyBac-mediated germline transformation. Ectopic expression of the male cDNA in females resulted in abnormal differentiation of certain female-specific genital organs and caused partial male differentiation in female genitalia. Transgenic analysis also revealed that the expression of BmDSXM in females caused repression of the female-specifically expressed gene, the vitellogenin gene, and also resulted in activation of the pheromone-binding protein gene that is dominantly expressed in males. These results provide evidence that the role of BmDSXM includes the activation of some aspects of male differentiation as well as the repression of female differentiation. Taken together with our previous data on the function of BmDSXF, we can conclude that Bmdsx is a double-switch gene at the final step in the sex-determination cascade of B. mori.",2005,"Masataka G Suzuki, Shunsuke Funaguma, Toshio Kanda, Toshiki Tamura, Toru Shimada, Masataka G Suzuki, Shunsuke Funaguma, Toshio Kanda, Toshiki Tamura, Toru Shimada"
A peritracheal neuropeptide system in insects: release of myomodulin-like peptides at ecdysis,9405303,,"We identified of a set of neuropeptide-expressing cells sited along the respiratory system of Drosophila melanogaster using an antibody to the molluscan neuropeptide myomodulin. The number and positions of these 'peritracheal' myomodulin (PM) cells were reminiscent of the epitracheal Inka cells in the moth Manduca sexta. These Inka cells release the peptide ecdysis-triggering hormone, which helps elicit ecdysial behavior at the molt, and we show that they are also recognized by the myomodulin (MM) antibody. In both D. melanogaster and M. sexta, the PM and Inka cells are the only MM-positive cells outside the central nervous system. In both insects, MM immunoreactivity disappears at the end of the molt. In D. melanogaster, we have monitored the PM cells throughout development using two enhancer trap lines; the PM cells persist throughout development, but at larval, pupal and adult ecdyses, they display a loss of MM immunoreactivity. This transient loss occurs at a predictable time, just prior to ecdysis. In contrast, MM-positive neurons in the central nervous system do not show these changes. The PM cells also reveal a concomitant loss of immunostaining for an enzyme contained in secretory granules. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the PM cells release MM-like peptides just prior to each ecdysis. In addition, we demonstrate that peritracheal cells of five widely divergent insect orders show a myomodulin phenotype.

"Global Proteomic Profiling of Drosophila Ovary: A High-resolution, Unbiased, Accurate and Multifaceted Analysis",26543083,,"Background:
      
    

    
      Drosophila melanogaster ovary serves as an attractive model system for the investigation of the cell cycle, death, signaling, migration, differentiation, development and stemness. By employing the 3750/+ heterozygote fly strain that carries specific functions in the follicle cell compartment, and a reliable control in GAL4/UAS-based transgenic technology, we herein characterized the protein-expression profiling of D. melanogaster ovary by applying high-resolution proteomic tools and bioinformatics programs.
    

    
  


        Materials and methods:
      
    

    
      Whole-cell total protein extracts derived from 3750/+ fly ovaries were prepared under highly denaturing conditions and after tryptic digestion, their cognate peptides were processed to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in a high-resolution LTQ Orbitrap Elite instrument. Obtained protein data were analyzed through use of UniProt, DAVID, KEGG and PANTHER bioinformatics platforms.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      The 7,583 unique peptides identified show that fly ovary contains at least 2,103 single proteins, which are distributed to all egg chamber compartments, in cytoplasm, membrane and nucleus, compartmentalized into major cellular organelles, and categorized into critical macromolecular assemblies. Among the recognized specific functions, nucleic acid binding, hydrolase, oxidoreductase, transporter and vesicle-mediated trafficking activities were the most prevalent. Determinants implicated in cellular metabolism and gene expression are represented by ~41% and ~17% of the ovarian proteome, respectively. Surprisingly, several proteins were found engaged in aging, immune response and neurogenesis. All major signaling pathways were detected, while apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death programs were also identified. Remarkably, proteins involved in tumor formation, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases were also recognized. The successful remodeling of the proteasome and nearly complete molecular reconstruction of the citrate cycle and fatty acid degradation pathways demonstrate the efficacy, accuracy and fidelity of our combined proteomics/bioinformatics approach.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:

Courtship behavior induced by appetitive olfactory memory,30955396,10.1080/01677063.2019.1593978,"Reinforcement signals such as food reward and noxious punishment can change diverse behaviors. This holds true in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, which can be conditioned by an odor and sugar reward or electric shock punishment. Despite a wide variety of behavior modulated by learning, conditioned responses have been traditionally measured by altered odor preference in a choice, and other memory-guided behaviors have been only scarcely investigated. Here, we analyzed detailed conditioned odor responses of flies after sugar associative learning by employing a video recording and semi-automated processing pipeline. Trajectory analyses revealed that multiple behavioral components were altered along with conditioned approach to the rewarded odor. Notably, we found that lateral wing extension, a hallmark of courtship behavior of D. melanogaster, was robustly increased specifically in the presence of the rewarded odor. Strikingly, genetic disruption of the mushroom body output did not impair conditioned courtship increase, while markedly weakening conditioned odor approach. Our results highlight the complexity of conditioned responses and their distinct regulatory mechanisms that may underlie coordinated yet complex memory-guided behaviors in flies.",2019,"Yuya Onodera, Rino Ichikawa, Kanta Terao, Hiromu Tanimoto, Nobuhiro Yamagata, Yuya Onodera, Rino Ichikawa, Kanta Terao, Hiromu Tanimoto, Nobuhiro Yamagata"
Mitochondria and Wolbachia titers are positively correlated during maternal transmission,29691935,10.1111/mec.14700,"Mothers provide their offspring with symbionts. Maternally transmitted, intracellular symbionts must disperse from mother to offspring with other cytoplasmic elements, like mitochondria. Here, we investigated how the intracellular symbiont Wolbachia interacts with mitochondria during maternal transmission. Mitochondria and Wolbachia may interact antagonistically and compete as each population tries to ensure its own evolutionary success. Alternatively, mitochondria and Wolbachia may cooperate as both benefit from ensuring the fitness of the mother. We characterized the relationship between mitochondria and Wolbachia titers in ovaries of Drosophila melanogaster. We found that mitochondria and Wolbachia titers are positively correlated in common laboratory genotypes of D. melanogaster. We attempted to perturb this covariation through the introduction of Wolbachia variants that colonize at different titers. We also attempted to perturb the covariation through manipulating the female reproductive tract to disrupt maternal transmission. Finally, we also attempted to disrupt the covariation by knocking down gene expression for two loci involved in mitochondrial metabolism: NADH dehydrogenase and a mitochondrial transporter. Overall, we find that mitochondria and Wolbachia titers are commonly positively correlated, but this positive covariation is disrupted at high titers of Wolbachia. Our results suggest that mitochondria and Wolbachia have likely evolved mechanisms to stably coexist, but the competitive dynamics change at high Wolbachia titers. We provide future directions to better understand how their interaction influences the maintenance of the symbiosis.",2018,"Lucas P Henry, Irene L G Newton, Lucas P Henry, Irene L G Newton"

Rexo5 is required for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and rRNA biogenesis and is essential in D. melanogaster. Loss-of-function mutants accumulate improperly 3' end-trimmed 28S rRNA, 5S rRNA, and snoRNA precursors in vivo. Rexo5 is ubiquitously expressed at low levels in somatic metazoan cells but extremely elevated in male and female germ cells. Loss of Rexo5 leads to increased nucleolar size, genomic instability, defective ribosome subunit export, and larval death.

RNAi reveals the key role of Nervana 1 in cockroach oogenesis and embryo development,23262289,10.1016/j.ibmb.2012.12.003,"Na(+), K(+)-ATPases is a heterodimer protein consisting of α- and β-subunits that control the ion transport through cell membranes. In insects the β-subunit of the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, known as Nervana, was characterized as a nervous system-specific glycoprotein antigen from adult Drosophila melanogaster heads. Nervana is expressed ubiquitously in all insect tissues, and in epithelial cells appeared located in a basolateral position as part of the septate junctions. Herein we study two Nervana isoforms from Blattella germanica, a cockroach species with panoistic ovaries. The sequencing and the phylogenetic analysis results suggest that these two isoforms are orthologs of D. melanogaster Nervana 1 and Nervana 2, respectively. Nervana 1 is highly expressed in the ovary of B. germanica, and depleting its expression results in changes in oocyte shape that do not impair oviposition. However, the resulting embryos show different defects and never hatch. These findings highlight the importance of this type of membrane pump in insect oogenesis as well as in embryo development, and its possible regulation by juvenile hormone.",2013,"Paula Irles, Fernanda A Silva-Torres, Maria-Dolors Piulachs, Paula Irles, Fernanda A Silva-Torres, Maria-Dolors Piulachs"
Determining rates of epithelial solute transport by optical measurement of fluorochrome concentration gradients in the unstirred layer,22875763,10.1242/jeb.070029,"We describe a method for calculating rates of fluorochrome transport from unstirred layer (USL) concentration gradients measured using confocal microscopy. Isolated Malpighian tubules or guts of Drosophila melanogaster were secured to depression slides and bathed in saline containing a fluorescent compound. By measuring the concentration gradient of fluorescent organic anions (fluorescein, Texas Red) or the P-glycoprotein substrate daunorubicin in the USL adjacent to the epithelium we were able to calculate the transepithelial flux of the fluorochrome using Fick's equation. Dose-response curves for fluorescein and Texas Red based on USL concentration gradients near the surface of the Malpighian tubule were comparable to those based on collection and analysis of secreted fluid droplets. Rates of Texas Red and daunorubicin secretion were also calculated for the gut of second instar D. melanogaster larvae, a tissue that is too small for measurement of transport rates by other in vitro techniques such as cannulation and perfusion. Our results suggest that measurement of USL concentration gradients by confocal microscopy may be applicable to any fluorescent indicator of rapidly transported compounds.",2012,"Sara Seabrooke, Michael J O'Donnell, Sara Seabrooke, Michael J O'Donnell"
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoter prediction using hybrid approach,21046474,10.1007/s12064-010-0114-8,"Promoters are modular DNA structures containing complex regulatory elements required for gene transcription initiation. Hence, the identification of promoters using machine learning approach is very important for improving genome annotation and understanding transcriptional regulation. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for the prediction of eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. However, the performances of these methods are still far from being satisfactory. In this article, we develop a hybrid approach (called IPMD) that combines position correlation score function and increment of diversity with modified Mahalanobis Discriminant to predict eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. By applying the proposed method to Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis promoter sequences, we achieve the sensitivities and specificities of 90.6 and 97.4% for D. melanogaster, 88.1 and 94.1% for H. sapiens, 83.3 and 95.2% for C. elegans, 84.9 and 91.4% for E. coli, as well as 80.4 and 91.3% for B. subtilis. The high accuracies indicate that the IPMD is an efficient method for the identification of eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. This approach can also be extended to predict other species promoters.",2011,"Hao Lin, Qian-Zhong Li, Hao Lin, Qian-Zhong Li"
"The occurrence, biodiversity and toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis strains isolated from the insect pest Lymantria dispar (Poland)",19824400,,"The aim of this investigation was to survey the occurrence, biodiversity, and toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis strains originating from dead caterpillars of the forest pest, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera). Morphological, biochemical, and microscopic identification of isolates from the insects showed the presence of five different Bacillus species, including 2% of B. thuringiensis. Based on the biochemical profiles, the B. thuringiensis were determined to be B. thuringiensis finitimus-like and B. thuringiensis alesti-like bacilli. Both produced spherical inclusions composed of three or five protoxins. The molecular weights of these proteins varied from 20 to ca. 64 kDa. Mixtures of spores/inclusions of the B. thuringiensis were tested for their toxicity against larvae of Drosophila melanogaster. The mortality levels of the larvae caused by these spores and crystalline inclusions varied from 5 to 15%. The lethal doses (LD50) of these isolates against D. melanogaster were 8.8 x 10(12) spores/ml for B. thuringiensis finitimus and 1.3 10(18) spores/ml for B. thuringiensis alesti.",2009,"Katarzyna Guz, Gabriela Bugla-P?osko?ska, W?odzimierz Doroszkiewicz, Katarzyna Guz, Gabriela Bugla-P?osko?ska, W?odzimierz Doroszkiewicz"
Fork head controls the timing and tissue selectivity of steroid-induced developmental cell death,17339378,10.1083/jcb.200611155,"Cell death during Drosophila melanogaster metamorphosis is controlled by the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Elements of the signaling pathway that triggers death are known, but it is not known why some tissues, and not others, die in response to a particular hormone pulse. We found that loss of the tissue-specific transcription factor Fork head (Fkh) is both required and sufficient to specify a death response to 20E in the larval salivary glands. Loss of fkh itself is a steroid-controlled event that is mediated by the 20E-induced BR-C gene, and that renders the key death regulators hid and reaper hormone responsive. These results implicate the D. melanogaster FOXA orthologue Fkh with a novel function as a competence factor for steroid-controlled cell death. They explain how a specific tissue is singled out for death, and why this tissue survives earlier hormone pulses. More generally, they suggest that cell identity factors like Fkh play a pivotal role in the normal control of developmental cell death.",2007,"Chike Cao, Yanling Liu, Michael Lehmann, Chike Cao, Yanling Liu, Michael Lehmann"
Study on genetic variation and DNA polymorphism for alpha-amylase gene of D. melanogaster in Korea,10340470,,"The restriction maps of the 20 kb Amy region of Drosophila melanogaster in Korean populations were surveyed from 27 isogenic second chromosome lines. A subset of these populations were also scored for isozyme type and adult enzyme activity of alpha-amylase. Among 34 kinds of restriction site variations that were observed in the 20 kb region surrounding the two transcriptional units of the duplicated Amy locus, nine were polymorphic (26.5%). The low frequencies at which each of the large insertions was found are consistent with earlier reports of variation in other loci. Restriction site variation in Korean populations provided an estimated heterozygosity per nucleotide pair of 0.007. Three pairwise comparisons showed relatively high levels of linkage disequilibria. The enzyme activity of the Chounan population showed no significant difference compared with that of the Pusan population, and the activity of heterozygotes was higher than that of Amy1. Lines bearing insertion/deletion exhibited relatively low enzyme activities. All lines examined showed the duplication of Amy transcriptional units that were highly conserved, and the manner of concerted evolution.",1999,"S J Kang, K H Park, K S Park, S J Kang, K H Park, K S Park"

Use of denaturing gradient electrophoresis to determine the distributions of polymorphisms in entire genes in natural populations,7841188,10.1016/0167-4781(94)00157-x,"We show here that the method of genomic denaturing gradient electrophoresis (gDGGE) can be used to examine any gene that has been previously cloned and sequenced, and to detect and approximately localize within the gene the majority of its polymorphisms. By using pooled-DNA gDGGE, many different samples can be scanned on a single gel. Further, the patterns on the gels and results from sequencing of some of the alleles shows that a variety of different kinds of polymorphism, ranging from single base changes to more substantial allelic differences, can be distinguished. The extramacrochaetae (emc) gene of Drosophila melanogaster exhibits no polymorphism in its ORF that can be detected by this method, although a rearrangement polymorphism was detected in the 3' downstream region of the gene. The suppressor-of-hairless (Su(H)) gene of D. melanogaster, however, exhibits a variety of polymorphisms in its ORF. Some are small deletions or insertions in a glutamine-rich part of the gene product that would not have been detectable by ordinary screening methods.

Yet little is known about how neurotransmitters regulate attractive and repulsive social cues. Using genetic and pharmacological manipulations in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that dopamine is contributing the response to others in a social group, specifically, social spacing, but not the avoidance of odours released by stressed flies (dSO). Interestingly, this dopamine-mediated behaviour is prominent only in the day-time, and its effect varies depending on tissue, sex and type of manipulation. Furthermore, alteration of dopamine levels has no effect on dSO avoidance regardless of sex, which suggests that a different neurotransmitter regulates this response.",2017,"Robert W Fernandez, Adesanya A Akinleye, Marat Nurilov, Omar Feliciano, Matthew Lollar, Rami R Aijuri, Janis M O'Donnell, Anne F Simon, Robert W Fernandez, Adesanya A Akinleye, Marat Nurilov, Omar Feliciano, Matthew Lollar, Rami R Aijuri, Janis M O'Donnell, Anne F Simon"

Fruit fly drosophila is a handy model system used to study this pathway since major components of the pathway are represented by unique factors. This article describes the usage of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells in studies of the pathway's target genes activation.

To explore this question in a tractable experimental system, we analyzed the impact of thymidine treatment on the synthesis of gypsy retroelement cDNA from Drosophila melanogaster during development through to hatching. The mutation frequency was enhanced approximately 16-fold over the levels seen in the experimental background. Due to the lack of proofreading, these gypsy elements represent hypervariable loci within the Drosophila genome, suggesting that dNTP pool imbalances in vivo are mutagenic.",2007,"Christophe Terzian, Michel Henry, Andreas Meyerhans, Simon Wain-Hobson, Jean-Pierre Vartanian, Christophe Terzian, Michel Henry, Andreas Meyerhans, Simon Wain-Hobson, Jean-Pierre Vartanian"

Malignant neoplasms of genetic origin in Drosophila melanogaster,96525,10.1126/science.96525,"Malignant neoplasms that develop in 12 recessive-lethal, larval mutants of Drosophila melanogaster are discussed. These mutations affect the adult optic neuroblasts and ganglion-mother cells in the larval brain, the imaginal discs, and the hematopoietic organs. The malignant neoplasms exhibit fast, autonomous growth, loss of the capacity for differentiation, increased mobility and invasiveness, lethality in situ and after transplantation, and histological, fine structural, and karyotypic abnormalities. Intermediate neoplasms are also found. These combine both benign and malignant qualities. They grow in a noninvasive, compact fashion, typical of benign tumors, yet they also exhibit malignant qualities such as fast, autonomous, and lethal growth, loss of differentiation capacity, changes in cellular morphology, and lethal growth after transplantation into wild-type hosts. Thus Drosophila and vertebrate neoplasms show striking similarities.",1978,"E Gateff, E Gateff"

Permeabilization of eggs of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae,8812094,10.1006/cryo.1996.0015,"Although Anopheles gambiae embryos that have developed for 15 h at 17 degrees C are slightly permeable to water, they are impermeable to ethylene glycol, the cryoprotectant used in the cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Success in cryopreservation requires that they be made permeable to protective solutes. Permeabilization of D. melanogaster was achieved by 1) dechorionation with 50% Clorox (household bleach) followed by 2) a water flush; 3) immersion in isopropyl alcohol to remove most extraembryonic water; 4) 2 min air drying to remove most isopropyl alcohol; 5) 90-s exposure to n-heptane containing 0.3% 1-butanol; and 6) 15-s exposure to pure n-heptane. The permeability of A. gambiae embryos was assessed by determining the times required for the initial dehydration of embryos in 1 M ethylene glycol in 260 mOsm Drosophila culture medium (permeability to water) and the times required for their return to normal volume (permeability to ethylene glycol). Based on these criteria, the above D. melanogaster procedure effectively permeabilizes 15 h/17 degrees C to 19 h/17 degrees C A. gambiae embryos. Nearly all collapsed in <5 min, and most returned to normal volume in approximately 40 min. Although permeable, all were killed by the permeabilization procedure. In analyzing the effect of each step on viability, 50% Clorox caused some lethality, and Clorox followed by isopropyl alcohol was 100% lethal. Decreasing the Clorox concentration to 10% still dechorionated eggs, but with reduced toxicity; substitution of a 10% solution of reagent-grade sodium hypochlorite for Clorox further decreased toxicity. The isopropyl alcohol step was also toxic. Consequently, the removal of residual surface water was achieved by substituting air drying for isopropyl alcohol. The drying took place under direct microscope observation and was continued until the embryos began to shrink. The combination of this modified method for dechorionation and controlled air drying before exposure to heptane resulted in permeabilization of all embryos in most runs and in approximately 30% survival of the permeabilized embryos.",1996,"M D Valencia, L H Miller, P Mazur, M D Valencia, L H Miller, P Mazur"

The genetics of mating recognition between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia,14768896,10.1017/s0016672303006360,"During courtship, visual and chemical signals are often exchanged between the sexes. The proper exchange of such signals ensures intraspecific recognition. We have examined the genetic basis of interspecific differences in male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration between Drosophila simulans and D. sechellia by using Drosophila simulans/D. sechellia introgression lines. Our results show a majority of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining variation in both male mating behaviour and pheromone concentration to be located on the third chromosome. One QTL found on the third chromosome explains variation in time needed to start courtship and copulation as well as time spent courting. The position of such QTL (approximately 84A-88B) with effects on courtship and copulation aspects of mating includes the candidate sex determination gene doublesex (84E5-6) and Voila (86E1-2), a gene that affects male courtship in D. melanogaster. One additional third chromosome QTL explained variation in 7-tricosene pheromone concentrations among males. The interval mapping position of this QTL (approximately 68E-76E) did not overlap with the position detected for differences in mating behaviour and the intervals did not include candidate genes previously identified as having an effect on D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon production. We did not detect any directionality of the effect of Drosophila sechellia allele introgressions in male mating recognition.",2003,"Alberto Civetta, Elliott J F Cantor, Alberto Civetta, Elliott J F Cantor"

I suggest that these events occurred at about the K/T boundary (65 million years ago) and that the typical Drosophila (as exemplified by D. melanogaster) evolved from flies unable to use fermenting substrates as breeding sites. I also hint that the ADH enzymes of other flies (e.g., the tephritid fruit flies) may have evolved independently of those of Drosophila, but from a common ancestral gene.",1998,"M Ashburner, M Ashburner"

Nuclear proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells after heat shock and their binding to homologous DNA,6777762,10.1093/nar/8.5.943,After 5 minutes heat shock at 37 degrees C Drosophila melanogaster Kc-cell nuclear proteins were extracted wit 0.4M NaCl and compared by SDS gel electrophoresis with extracts from cells grown at 25 degrees C. Two proteins (39 000 and 46 000) were only found in heat shock nuclei. Reconstitution with total Drosophila DNA or a DNA fragment from the heat inducible locus 87A/C covalently coupled to sepharose was performed. In the presence of calf thymus competitor DNA these proteins and also others of lower molecular weight showed preferential binding to the homologous DNA.,1980,"F G Falkner, H Biessmann, F G Falkner, H Biessmann"
[Chromosome aberrations induced by gamma radiation in the somatic cells of a radiosensitive mutant line of Drosophila melanogaster],6766426,,Chromosome aberrations induced by gamma-rays in ganglia cells of Drosophila melanogaster larvae have been studied. Two strains of Drosophila were used: radiosensitive mutant rad (2) 201G1 and normal strain. It has been shown that the frequency of cells with chromosome aberrations in radiosensitive larvae is much more than in normal larvae after gamma-irradiation. The ratio of chromosome and chromatid deletions number to the number of exchange type aberrations is the same for both strains. The kinetics of chromosome aberrations induced in rad-larvae is similar to the normal one. The conclusion has been made that the realization of rad (2) 201G1 mutation takes place on the cell level.,1980,"V V Levina, O V Malinovskiĭ, I A Zakharov, V V Levina, O V Malinovskiĭ, I A Zakharov"

Mutants within each cistron have similar lethality patterns and morphological attributes, and the characteristics of a given cistron are distinct with respect to other cistrons.

High functional conservation of takeout family members in a courtship model system,30261021,10.1371/journal.pone.0204615,"takeout (to) is one of the male-specific genes expressed in the fat body that regulate male courtship behavior, and has been shown to act as a secreted protein in conjunction with courtship circuits. There are 23 takeout family members in Drosophila melanogaster, and homologues of this family are distributed across insect species. Sequence conservation among family members is low. Here we test the functional conservation of takeout family members by examining whether they can rescue the takeout courtship defect. We find that despite their sequence divergence takeout members from Aedes aegypti and Epiphas postvittana, as well as family members from D. melanogaster can substitute for takeout in courtship, demonstrating their functional conservation. Making use of the known E. postvittana Takeout structure, we used homology modeling and amphipathic helix analysis and found high overall structural conservation, including high conservation of the structure and amphipathic lining of an internal cavity that has been shown to accommodate hydrophobic ligands. Together these data suggest a high degree of structural conservation that likely underlies functional conservation in courtship. In addition, we have identified a role for a conserved exposed protein motif important for the protein's role in courtship.",2018,"Sumit Saurabh, Nancy Vanaphan, Walter Wen, Brigitte Dauwalder, Sumit Saurabh, Nancy Vanaphan, Walter Wen, Brigitte Dauwalder"

Organism-handling robots could revolutionize large-scale experiments in the way that liquid-handling robots accelerated molecular biology. We developed a modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE), an organism-handling robot capable of conducting lab tasks and experiments, and then deployed it to conduct common experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Physarum polycephalum, Bombus impatiens, and Drosophila melanogaster. Focusing on fruit flies, we developed a suite of experimental modules that permitted the automated collection of virgin females and execution of an intricate and laborious social behavior experiment. We discovered that (1) pairs of flies exhibit persistent idiosyncrasies in social behavior, which (2) require olfaction and vision, and (3) social interaction network structure is stable over days. These diverse examples demonstrate MAPLE's versatility for automating experimental biology.",2018,"Tom Alisch, James D Crall, Albert B Kao, Dave Zucker, Benjamin L de Bivort, Tom Alisch, James D Crall, Albert B Kao, Dave Zucker, Benjamin L de Bivort"

In this study we have used Drosophila melanogaster proteins triple tagged with Flag, Strep II, and Yellow fluorescent protein in vivo within affinity pull-down experiments and isolated these proteins in their native complexes from embryos. We describe a pipeline for determining interactomes by Parallel Affinity Capture (iPAC) and show its use by identifying partners of several protein baits with a range of sizes and subcellular locations. This purification protocol employs the different tags in parallel and involves detailed comparison of resulting mass spectrometry data sets, ensuring the interaction lists achieved are of high confidence. We show that this approach identifies known interactors of bait proteins as well as novel interaction partners by comparing data achieved with published interaction data sets.

Soluble HLA-DQ2 expressed in S2 cells copurifies with a high affinity insect cell derived protein,18987854,10.1007/s00251-008-0338-7,"We here describe that soluble HLA-DQ2 (sDQ2) molecules, when expressed in Drosophila melanogaster S2 insect cells without a covalently tethered peptide, associate tightly with the D. melanogaster calcium binding protein DCB-45. The interaction between the proteins is stable in S2 cell culture and during affinity purification, which is done at high salt concentrations and pH 11.5. After affinity purification, the sDQ2/DCB-45 complex exists in substantial quantities next to a small amount of free heterodimeric sDQ2 and large amounts of aggregated sDQ2 free of DCB-45. Motivated by the stable complex formation and our interest in the development of reagents which inhibit HLA-DQ2 peptide binding, we have further characterized the sDQ2/DCB-45 interaction. Several lines of evidence indicate that an N-terminal fragment of DCB-45 is involved in the interaction with the peptide binding groove of sDQ2. Further mapping of this fragment of 54 residues identified a pentadecapeptide with high affinity for sDQ2 which may serve as a lead compound for the design of HLA-DQ2 blockers.",2009,"Ulrike Jüse, Burkhard Fleckenstein, Elin Bergseng, Ludvig M Sollid, Ulrike Jüse, Burkhard Fleckenstein, Elin Bergseng, Ludvig M Sollid"
Human DNMT2 methylates tRNA(Asp) molecules using a DNA methyltransferase-like catalytic mechanism,18567810,10.1261/rna.970408,"Although their amino acid sequences and structure closely resemble DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt2 proteins were recently shown by Goll and colleagues to function as RNA methyltransferases transferring a methyl group to the C5 position of C38 in tRNA(Asp). We observe that human DNMT2 methylates tRNA isolated from Dnmt2 knock-out Drosophila melanogaster and Dictyostelium discoideum. RNA extracted from wild type D. melanogaster was methylated to a lower degree, but in the case of Dictyostelium, there was no difference in the methylation of RNA isolated from wild-type and Dnmt2 knock-out strains. Methylation of in vitro transcribed tRNA(Asp) confirms it to be a target of DNMT2. Using site directed mutagenesis, we show here that the enzyme has a DNA methyltransferase-like mechanism, because similar residues from motifs IV, VI, and VIII are involved in catalysis as identified in DNA methyltransferases. In addition, exchange of C292, which is located in a CFT motif conserved among Dnmt2 proteins, strongly reduced the catalytic activity of DNMT2. Dnmt2 represents the first example of an RNA methyltransferase using a DNA methyltransferase type of mechanism.",2008,"Tomasz P Jurkowski, Madeleine Meusburger, Sameer Phalke, Mark Helm, Wolfgang Nellen, Gunter Reuter, Albert Jeltsch, Tomasz P Jurkowski, Madeleine Meusburger, Sameer Phalke, Mark Helm, Wolfgang Nellen, Gunter Reuter, Albert Jeltsch"
Wnt11 controls cell contact persistence by local accumulation of Frizzled 7 at the plasma membrane,17130287,10.1083/jcb.200606017,"Wnt11 is a key signal, determining cell polarization and migration during vertebrate gastrulation. It is known that Wnt11 functionally interacts with several signaling components, the homologues of which control planar cell polarity in Drosophila melanogaster. Although in D. melanogaster these components are thought to polarize cells by asymmetrically localizing at the plasma membrane, it is not yet clear whether their subcellular localization plays a similarly important role in vertebrates. We show that in zebrafish embryonic cells, Wnt11 locally functions at the plasma membrane by accumulating its receptor, Frizzled 7, on adjacent sites of cell contacts. Wnt11-induced Frizzled 7 accumulations recruit the intracellular Wnt signaling mediator Dishevelled, as well as Wnt11 itself, and locally increase cell contact persistence. This increase in cell contact persistence is mediated by the local interaction of Wnt11, Frizzled 7, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo at the plasma membrane, and it does not require the activity of further downstream effectors of Wnt11 signaling, such as RhoA and Rok2. We propose that Wnt11, by interacting with Frizzled 7 and Flamingo, modulates local cell contact persistence to coordinate cell movements during gastrulation.",2006,"Sabine Witzel, Vitaly Zimyanin, Filipa Carreira-Barbosa, Masazumi Tada, Carl-Philipp Heisenberg, Sabine Witzel, Vitaly Zimyanin, Filipa Carreira-Barbosa, Masazumi Tada, Carl-Philipp Heisenberg"
Quantifying the gender load: can population crosses reveal interlocus sexual conflict?,16612894,10.1098/rstb.2005.1786,"Six sister populations of Drosophila melanogaster kept under identical environmental conditions for greater than 600 generations were reciprocally crossed to investigate the incidence of population divergence in allopatry. Population crosses directly influenced fitness, mating frequency, and sperm competition patterns. Changes in both female remating rate and the outcome of male sperm competition (P1, P2) in response to foreign males were consistent with intersexual coevolution. Moreover, seven of the 30 crosses between foreign mates resulted in significant reductions in female fitness, whereas two resulted in significant increases, compared to local matings. This tendency for foreign males to reduce female fitness may be interpreted as evidence for either sexually antagonistic coevolution or the disruption of mutualistic interactions. However, instances in which female fitness improved via cohabitation with foreign males may better reveal sexual conflict, signalling release from the cost of interacting with locally adapted males. By this metric, female reproduction in D. melanogaster is strongly constrained by local adaptation by males, a situation that would promote antagonistic coevolution between the sexes. We conclude that sexual selection can promote population differentiation in allopatry and that sexual conflict is likely to have played a role in population differentiation in this study system.",2006,"Tristan A F Long, Robert Montgomerie, Adam K Chippindale, Tristan A F Long, Robert Montgomerie, Adam K Chippindale"
Diego and Prickle regulate Frizzled planar cell polarity signalling by competing for Dishevelled binding,15937478,10.1038/ncb1271,"Epithelial planar cell polarity (PCP) is evident in the cellular organization of many tissues in vertebrates and invertebrates. In mammals, PCP signalling governs convergent extension during gastrulation and the organization of a wide variety of structures, including the orientation of body hair and sensory hair cells of the inner ear. In Drosophila melanogaster, PCP is manifest in adult tissues, including ommatidial arrangement in the compound eye and hair orientation in wing cells. PCP establishment requires the conserved Frizzled/Dishevelled PCP pathway. Mutations in PCP-pathway-associated genes cause aberrant orientation of body hair or inner-ear sensory cells in mice, or misorientation of ommatidia and wing hair in D. melanogaster. Here we provide mechanistic insight into Frizzled/Dishevelled signalling regulation. We show that the ankyrin-repeat protein Diego binds directly to Dishevelled and promotes Frizzled signalling. Dishevelled can also be bound by the Frizzled PCP antagonist Prickle. Strikingly, Diego and Prickle compete with one another for Dishevelled binding, thereby modulating Frizzled/Dishevelled activity and ensuring tight control over Frizzled PCP signalling.",2005,"Andreas Jenny, Jessica Reynolds-Kenneally, Gishnu Das, Micheal Burnett, Marek Mlodzik, Andreas Jenny, Jessica Reynolds-Kenneally, Gishnu Das, Micheal Burnett, Marek Mlodzik"

The kinetics of early events is proportionally similar in both systems, but late movements (from germ band retraction on) progress slower in An. albitarsis. Major differences in An. albitarsis related to D. melanogaster were: (1) pole cells do not protrude from the blastoderm; (2) the mosquito embryo undergoes a 180 degrees rotation movement, along its longitudinal axis; (3) the head remains individualized throughout embryogenesis; (4) extraembryonary membranes surround the whole embryo.

We have completed a phylogenetic analysis of 15 DSL proteins from eight species. Our findings reveal that at least one gene duplication occurred prior to the divergence of the Drosophila melanogaster and vertebrate lineages, with subsequent duplications in vertebrates. The three known Caenorhabditis elegans proteins likely arose by two independent duplications in the nematode lineage. Analysis of EGF repeats suggests that EGF 2 has been conserved among DSL proteins in vertebrates and D. melanogaster. The sequences of two EGF repeats have been perfectly conserved in vertebrate orthologs: EGF 2 in Delta and EGF 15 in Jagged/Serrate.

Slowing of age-specific mortality rates in Drosophila melanogaster,8137895,10.1016/0531-5565(93)90048-i,"We have studied age-dependent mortality in large cohorts of male and female D. melanogaster from four inbred lines. Average longevity varies substantially between genotypes (broad-sense heritability = 22%). Contrary to the predictions of the Gompertz model, mortality rates tend to decelerate at the most advanced ages. Fitting Gompertz, Weibull, Logistic, and Two-stage Gompertz mortality models to the data, we find that the best fit is obtained with the two-stage model, with exponentially increasing mortality at early ages, and zero or nearly zero increase at older ages. There is little microenvironmental effect from cage to cage. There is a sex-dependent mortality crossover: males and females differ in initial mortality rate and degree of acceleration of mortality rate, but the ordering of the sexes according to mortality parameters depends on genotype. Model fitting can be affected by gaps between deaths in the tail of the survivorship distribution. The observations are inconsistent with the limited life-span paradigm, which predicts sudden and well-defined drops in survivorship and corresponding sharp increases in mortality at advanced ages for large cohorts of genetically identical individuals.",1993,"H H Fukui, L Xiu, J W Curtsinger, H H Fukui, L Xiu, J W Curtsinger"

The SA line was selected for two symmetrical anterior extra bristles, and the ASD line was selected for two asymmetrical extra bristles, one anterior and one posterior. Only the SA line showed any canalizing response (estimated by the width of the probit transformation) at the two-extra-bristle class. Nevertheless, the results from the different lines were more consistent with the independent ones of both the anterior and posterior regions of the extra dorsocentral bristles. This analysis showed some independent genetic systems for each region, developmental canalization being at two extra symmetrical bristles per region in all the selected lines (D2, ASD, and SA). Therefore, this canalization did not depend directly on the extra-bristle positional pattern used in the selection.

Analysis of Genetic Variation Indicates DNA Shape Involvement in Purifying Selection,29850830,10.1093/molbev/msy099,"Noncoding DNA sequences, which play various roles in gene expression and regulation, are under evolutionary pressure. Gene regulation requires specific protein-DNA binding events, and our previous studies showed that both DNA sequence and shape readout are employed by transcription factors (TFs) to achieve DNA binding specificity. By investigating the shape-disrupting properties of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human regulatory regions, we established a link between disruptive local DNA shape changes and loss of specific TF binding. Furthermore, we described cases where disease-associated SNPs may alter TF binding through DNA shape changes. This link led us to hypothesize that local DNA shape within and around TF binding sites is under selection pressure. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed SNP data derived from 216 natural strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing SNPs located in functional and nonfunctional regions within experimentally validated cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) from D. melanogaster that are active in the blastoderm stage of development, we found that SNPs within functional regions tended to cause smaller DNA shape variations. Furthermore, SNPs with higher minor allele frequency were more likely to result in smaller DNA shape variations. The same analysis based on a large number of SNPs in putative CRMs of the D. melanogaster genome derived from DNase I accessibility data confirmed these observations.

In contrast, the purified LBD of Oncopeltus fasciatus displayed a Soret maximum at 415 nm for the ferric protein that shifted to 425 nm in its ferrous state. Binding of (??NO to the heme moiety of the D. melanogaster and B. mori E75 LBD resulted in the appearance of a peak at 385 nm, whereas this peak appeared at 416 nm in the case of the O. fasciatus hemoprotein, resembling the behavior displayed by its human homologue, Rev-erbβ. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that, unlike the D. melanogaster and B. mori counterparts, the heme group of O. fasciatus is covalently attached to the protein through the side chains of two amino acids. The high degree of sequence homology with O. fasciatus E75 led us to clone and express the LBD of Blattella germanica, which established that its spectral properties closely resemble those of O. fasciatus and that it also has the heme group covalently bound to the protein. Hence, (??NO/CO regulation of the transcriptional activity of these nuclear receptors might be differently controlled among various insect species.

Highly expressed genes, such as those encoding ribosomal proteins and histones in S. pombe, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, have biased patterns of codon usage which have been observed in a wide range of unicellular organisms. In S. pombe and C. elegans, codons contributing positively to the principal component with the largest variance (Z1-parameter) corresponded to the optimal codons which were predicted on the basis of tRNA gene numbers. In D. melanogaster, this correlation was less evident, and the codons contributing positively to the Z1-parameter corresponded primarily to codons with a C or G in the codon third position. In X. laevis and H. sapiens, codon usage in the genes encoding ribosomal proteins and histones was not significantly biased, suggesting that the primary factor influencing codon-usage diversity in these species is not translation efficiency. Codon-usage diversity in these species is known to reflect primarily isochore structures. In the present study, the second additional factor was explained by the level of use of codons containing CG-dinucleotides, and this is discussed with respect to transcription regulation via methylation of CG-dinucleotides, which is observed in mammalian genomes.",2001,"S Kanaya, Y Yamada, M Kinouchi, Y Kudo, T Ikemura, S Kanaya, Y Yamada, M Kinouchi, Y Kudo, T Ikemura"
Butyrate induced alterations during development of the strain ln(1)BM2(reinverted) of Drosophila melanogaster,11495283,,"The polytene male X chromosome of D. melanogaster, has a unique morphology, which is correlated with the property of increased transcription of the sex-linked genes of the male X chromosome. This ensures equalization of X-linked gene products between males (XY) and females (XX). Till date, an invariable correlation between the structure and transcription of the male X chromosome has been reported. However, the strain In(1)BM2(reinverted) of D. melanogaster presents a caveat to this invariable correlation. In this strain, although the male X chromosome appears puffy and diffuse, the transcription remains at the wild type level. This observation suggests the perturbation in the function of a regulator that controls the structure of the male X chromosome. In this report the response of the strain to butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, has been studied, with specific reference to development, sex ratio and chromosome morphology of the strain. Two important conclusions arise from these experiments : (a) exposure to butyrate has more severe consequences on the development of the mutant strain and on the survival of females. (b) rearing on butyrate induced a temporal series of structural alteration of the polytene chromosome of the wild type, with the male X chromosome being most vulnerable to structural changes. The butyrate-interaction of In(1)BM2(reinverted) together with our current biochemical analyses of a chromosome coiling protein recovered from this strain, provide data for a working hypothesis explaining the sex and chromosome specific alteration of the structure of the male X chromosome of In(1)BM2(reinverted).",2001,"I Dey-Guha, A Kar, I Dey-Guha, A Kar"

Although most of the middle repetitive DNA of D. melanogaster consists of segments of ""nomadic"" DNA that occupy different dispersed chromosomal locations in different strains of flies, repeated DNA sequences recovered from the D. simulans genome are most often restricted to single chromosomal positions. Apparent differences in the total concentrations of middle repetitive DNA in the two species are most easily attributed to an approximately sevenfold difference in their dispersed repetitive and nomadic DNA contents. These differences may affect the relative mutation rates of these species or contribute to their reproductive isolation or both.",1982,"A P Dowsett, M W Young, A P Dowsett, M W Young"
Synergism and Combinatorial Coding for Binary Odor Mixture Perception in Drosophila,27588303,10.1523/ENEURO.0056-14.2016,"Most odors in the natural environment are mixtures of several compounds. Olfactory receptors housed in the olfactory sensory neurons detect these odors and transmit the information to the brain, leading to decision-making. But whether the olfactory system detects the ingredients of a mixture separately or treats mixtures as different entities is not well understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, we have demonstrated that fruit flies perceive binary odor mixtures in a manner that is heavily dependent on both the proportion and the degree of dilution of the components, suggesting a combinatorial coding at the peripheral level. This coding strategy appears to be receptor specific and is independent of interneuronal interactions.",2016,"Srikanya Kundu, Anindya Ganguly, Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty, Arun Kumar, Obaid Siddiqi, Srikanya Kundu, Anindya Ganguly, Tuhin Subhra Chakraborty, Arun Kumar, Obaid Siddiqi"

The inactive mutation leads to abnormal experience-dependent courtship modification in male Drosophila melanogaster,7993316,10.1007/BF01067539,"Flies carrying the inactive mutation of Drosophila melanogaster have only 15% wild-type titers of the putative neurotransmitter octopamine. With a view to discovering whether the inactive mutation impairs learning, I describe the effect of the inactive mutation on experience-dependent courtship modification (EDCM). Wild-type males rapidly condition to immature males and modify their behaviour toward subsequent target flies. The weaker EDCM phenotype of inactive males is similar to that of dunce males. Using time-sampling, habituation is most rapid for wild-type males and slowest for dunce males, with inactive males showing an intermediate phenotype. These results support the notion that octopamine plays a significant role in the manifestation of Drosophila learning behavior.",1994,"K M O'Dell, K M O'Dell"
Evaluation of genotoxicity of the indenoisoquinoline analogues of fagaronine and nitidine in Drosophila melanogaster,7680753,10.1016/0165-7992(93)90059-5,The wing spot test of Drosophila melanogaster was done to evaluate the genotoxicity of the antitumor indenoisoquinoline analogues of nitidine chloride and fagaronine chloride in larvae. Both compounds have toxic effects but no statistically significant increase in the frequency of spots was detected with the analogue of nitidine chloride. This strongly suggests that this compound is not mutagenic to Drosophila larvae at the concentrations tested. Results with the analogue of fagaronine chloride were ambiguous. Low mutagenicity was detected in only one of two experiments and in the pooled results at 2 mM but not at 5 mM or 10 mM. These results suggest at best a very weak genotoxic effect but its biological significance needs confirmation by results from other assays.,1993,"Y Pérez-Chiesa, Z Narváez, Y Pérez-Chiesa, Z Narváez"

Higher variational rate was found in S2. After removing the variant flies, the variational rate of the remaining Drosophila progeny decreased generation by generation. There was no notable sex-linked recessive lethal mutation of parent flies and no gene mutation found in their test-cross examination. It indicates that the germ-cell of parent adult flies were not much influenced by microgravity, but the embryo of filial generation bred in space were greatly influenced by microgravity. Therefore, the mutagenesis during the embryogenic development should be taken into account in the bio-breeding under the space microgravitational environment.",1992,"X G Li, G Z Wang, X G Li, G Z Wang"

These cell membrane proteins steer many important processes such as development, reproduction, homeostasis and behaviour when activated by their corresponding ligands. The first insect genome, that of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, was sequenced in 2000, and about 200 GPCRs have been annnotated in this model insect. About 50 of these receptors were predicted to have neuropeptides or protein hormones as their ligands. Since 2000, the cDNAs of most of these candidate receptors have been cloned and for many receptors the endogenous ligand has been identified. In this review, we will give an update about the current knowledge of all Drosophila neuropeptide and protein hormone receptors, and discuss their phylogenetic relationships.",2006,"Frank Hauser, Michael Williamson, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen, Frank Hauser, Michael Williamson, Giuseppe Cazzamali, Cornelis J P Grimmelikhuijzen"
The host defense of Drosophila melanogaster,17201680,10.1146/annurev.immunol.25.022106.141615,"To combat infection, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster relies on multiple innate defense reactions, many of which are shared with higher organisms. These reactions include the use of physical barriers together with local and systemic immune responses. First, epithelia, such as those beneath the cuticle, in the alimentary tract, and in tracheae, act both as a physical barrier and local defense against pathogens by producing antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species. Second, specialized hemocytes participate in phagocytosis and encapsulation of foreign intruders in the hemolymph. Finally, the fat body, a functional equivalent of the mammalian liver, produces humoral response molecules including antimicrobial peptides. Here we review our current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying Drosophila defense reactions together with strategies evolved by pathogens to evade them.",2007,"Bruno Lemaitre, Jules Hoffmann, Bruno Lemaitre, Jules Hoffmann"
[The M/SAR elements of the bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster],16358714,,"The bithorax (BX) complex of Drosophila is a complex polygenic region with a multifactorial system of regulation. One of the levels of the regulatory system of the BX complex is its association with the nuclear skeleton structures through a specific interaction of the M/SAR DNA with the nuclear matrix proteins. In the present work, M/SAR elements were mapped on the molecular-genetic map of the region. All of the elements examined were found to colocalize with regulatory elements and form clusters that restrict/bracket the genetically active domains. All M/SAR DNA revealed was shown to bins specifically to the purified Drosophila melanogaster lamin.",2005,"T V Boĭkova, V Orlando, R Lupo, S S Bogachev, T V Boĭkova, V Orlando, R Lupo, S S Bogachev"
The immune response of Drosophila melanogaster,15199954,10.1111/j.0105-2896.2004.0130.x,"The response of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to various microorganism infections relies on a multilayered defense. The epithelia constitute a first and efficient barrier. Innate immunity is activated when microorganisms succeed in entering the body cavity of the fly. Invading microorganisms are killed by the combined action of cellular and humoral processes. They are phagocytosed by specialized blood cells, surrounded by toxic melanin, or lysed by antibacterial peptides secreted into the hemolymph by fat body cells. During the last few years, research has focused on the mechanisms of microbial recognition by various pattern recognition receptors and of the subsequent induction of antimicrobial peptide expression. The cellular arm of the Drosophila innate immune system, which was somehow neglected, now constitutes the new frontier.",2004,"Vincent Leclerc, Jean-Marc Reichhart, Vincent Leclerc, Jean-Marc Reichhart"
Apparent retardation of aging in Drosophila melanogaster by inhibitors of reverse transcriptase,7518199,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb12087.x,"It is proposed that aging is induced by somatic replication of transposable elements (TEs). Most transposable elements in Drosophila reproduce by reverse transcription. Therefore inhibitors of reverse transcriptase were tested for their ability to retard aging in Drosophila melanogaster. Two inhibitors, phosphonoformic acid (PFA) and dideoxyinosine (ddI), were capable of prolonging life span when administered for the first half of the adult life. PFA was investigated further. It also produced a reduction in the rate of decline of behavior. PFA appeared not to act on an infectious agent in these experiments, nor did it alter the food intake. Analogues unable to inhibit RT had no life span prolonging effect at similar concentrations to that of PFA.",1994,"C J Driver, D J Vogrig, C J Driver, D J Vogrig"
Evidence for a Wolbachia symbiont in Drosophila melanogaster,7691685,10.1017/s0016672300031529,"The bacterial cell division gene, ftsZ, was used as a specific probe to show the presence of a symbiotic bacterium in two wild type strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Under stringent hybridization conditions we have shown that the bacterium is transferred to the progeny of these strains from infected mothers and can be eradicated by treatment with the antibiotic tetracycline. We have characterized this bacterium, by amplifying and sequencing its 16S rRNA gene, as being a member of the genus Wolbachia, an organism that is known to parasitize a range of insects including Drosophila simulans. In a series of reciprocal crosses no evidence was found that the symbiont causes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) which is known to occur in infected strains of D. simulans. The implications of these findings are discussed.",1993,"P R Holden, P Jones, J F Brookfield, P R Holden, P Jones, J F Brookfield"

A tRNATyr gene was site specifically mutated to produce an anticodon sequence that recognizes the amber codon and then introduced into Drosophila by using P-element-mediated transformation. Transformants from four integration events were recovered. Two integrations resulted in both male and female sterility, whereas the other two resulted in male sterility but female fertility. Strains derived from the two female-fertile integration events were shown to have a low level of amber-suppressing activity by their ability to suppress an amber mutation in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.",1989,"F A Laski, S Ganguly, P A Sharp, U L RajBhandary, G M Rubin, F A Laski, S Ganguly, P A Sharp, U L RajBhandary, G M Rubin"
The Effects of Interspecific Competition on the Dynamics of a Polymorphism in an Experimental Population of DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,17248954,,"Populations of Drosophila melanogaster with a fourth-chromosome polymorphism were subjected to different levels of competition with Drosophila simulans. The dynamics of the polymorphism and the equilibrium frequencies of the sparkling allele were seen to depend on the competitive level, while the higher productivity of the competing populations was shown to be due to the initial parental density. The effects of competition on fitness components were quantified by fitting the data to both a two-stage selection model and a fertility model. Additional experiments were performed to verify that the interspecific competition caused the changes in fitness. The results are discussed in light of the importance of considering selection components in models of ecological genetics.",1979,"A Clark, A Clark"
Regulation in rDNA-deficient Drosophila melanogaster,804354,10.1016/0092-8674(75)90176-2,"Bobbed mutants of Drosophila melanogaster were used to determine whether there is any functional compensation for deficiency in rDNA content. The rate of rRNA accumulation was measured in the testes of five bb mutants of different phenotypic severity and in a wild type strain. The different rates of rRNA accumulation were compared to the phenotype (macroscutellar bristle length) and found to have a direct correlation (as in Weinman, 1972). However, there was not a direct relationship between the rate of rRNA accumulation and rDNA content. It is concluded that there is regulation of rRNA accumulation in some mutants, but that the regulation cannot be considered to be a compensation for the lack of rDNA. These results are discussed relative to other observations on the regulation of RNA synthesis in Drosophila.",1975,"A W Shermoen, B I Kiefer, A W Shermoen, B I Kiefer"

The expression patterns of two TEs, P element transposon and 412 retrotransposon, were investigated during Drosophila melanogaster and D. willistoni embryogenesis, by means of embryo hybridization using riboprobes. Spatiotemporal transcription patterns for both TEs were similar to those of developmental genes. Although the two species shared the same P element transcription pattern, this was not so with 412 retrotransposon. These findings suggest that the regulatory sequences involved in the initial development of Drosophila spp are located in the transposable element sequences, and differences, such as in this case of the 412 retrotransposon, lead to losses or changes in their transcription patterns.",2011,"Monica Laner Blauth, Rafaela Vieira Bruno, Eliana Abdelhay, Vera Lúcia Silva Valente, Monica Laner Blauth, Rafaela Vieira Bruno, Eliana Abdelhay, Vera Lúcia Silva Valente"

Multigenerational effects of cadmium on the lifespan and fertility of Drosophila melanogaster,31855751,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.125533,"Although the damage and tolerance mechanisms of Cd stress are known, the data on genetic risk are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the chronic toxicity of Cd, genetic responses, and multigenerational effects in five generations of Drosophila melanogaster. For each generation, lifespan and fertility were statistically analysed and the expression of apoptosis- (p53 and caspase-3) and epigenesis-related (dDnmt2 and dMBD2/3) genes was examined. Lifespan and fertility significantly declined under Cd stress and these effects were maintained for two generations and one generation, respectively, when Cd stress was removed. The expression of p53 and caspase-3 was significantly up-regulated after exposure, suggesting that apoptosis contributes to the resistance mechanism. Their altered expression was retained for two generations. Furthermore, high expression of dDnmt2 and dMBD2/3 accompanied Cd exposure, which was passed on to three generations, suggesting that genetic modifications in apoptosis-related genes are carried to the offspring through epigenetic regulation.",2020,"Xingran Yang, Yan Han, Yun Mu, Pingping Yang, Wei Gu, Min Zhang, Xingran Yang, Yan Han, Yun Mu, Pingping Yang, Wei Gu, Min Zhang"
Sexual activity increases resistance against Pseudomonas entomophila in male Drosophila melanogaster,24010544,10.1186/1471-2148-13-185,"Background:
      
    

    
      Maintenance and deployment cost of immunity is high, therefore, it is expected to trade-off with other high cost traits like sexual activity. Previous studies with Drosophila melanogaster show that male's ability to clear bacteria decreases with increase in sexual activity. We subjected this idea to test using two pathogens (Pseudomonas entomophila and Staphylococcus succinus) and three different populations of Drosophila melanogaster.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found that sexual activity enhanced male survivorship in a pathogen specific manner. Sexually active males show higher resistance than virgins upon infection with Pseudomonas entomophila. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of sexual activity increased with time of co-habitation with females and declined when access to females was restricted. We observed no change in male survivorship upon experimentally varying the number of sexual interactions.
    

    
  


        Conclusion:
      
    

    
      Our results show that the sexual activity-immunity trade-off in males cannot be generalised. The trade-off is potentially mediated through complex interactions between the host, pathogen and the environment experienced by the host.",2013,"Vanika Gupta, Zeeshan S Ali, Nagaraj G Prasad, Vanika Gupta, Zeeshan S Ali, Nagaraj G Prasad"
Genetic background and GxE interactions modulate the penetrance of a naturally occurring wing mutation in Drosophila melanogaster,24002866,10.1534/g3.113.007831,"Many genes involved in producing complex traits are incompletely penetrant. One such example is vesiculated, an X-linked gene in Drosophila melanogaster that results in wing defects. To examine the genetic architecture of a complex trait (wings containing vesicles), we placed a naturally occurring variant into multiple autosomal backgrounds and quantified penetrance and expressivity at a range of developmental temperatures. We found significant epistasis, genotype-by-environment interactions, and maternal effects. Sex and temperature effects were modulated by genetic background. The severity of wing phenotypes also varied across different genetic backgrounds, and expressivity was positively correlated with penetrance. We also found evidence of naturally segregating suppressors of vesiculated. These suppressors were present on both the second and third chromosomes, and complex interactions were observed. Taken together, these findings indicate that multiple genetic and environmental factors modulate the phenotypic effects of a naturally occurring vesiculated allele.",2013,"Joseph Lachance, Lawrence Jung, John R True, Joseph Lachance, Lawrence Jung, John R True"
Preventive role of folic acid on the developmental toxicity of phenol in Drosophila melanogaster,18717517,10.1177/0748233708090905,"Phenol (PN), obtained from coal tar, is used commonly in medical treatments, industrial areas, petroleum refineries, production of glue, fiber, and nylon. PN is used in the production of benzene and it is emitted in the atmosphere by motor vehicles. Folic acid (FA) is an essential nutrient among the B complex group of vitamins. The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PN and PN + FA on various developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster. Different concentrations of PN and PN + FA were administered during the developmental periods of the fly (egg, larva and pupa). When F1 progeny of control and experimental groups were compared, PN was found to extend the process of metamorphosis and decrease the total offspring numbers. However, these negative effects were inhibited by FA treatment at different concentrations (0.25-2.50 mg/kg). These results suggest that FA could effectively inhibit PN-induced abnormalities in developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster.",2007,"H A?kin, H Uysal, D Altun, H A?kin, H Uysal, D Altun"
Assessment of heavy metals concentrations in soil samples from the vicinity of busy roads: influence on Drosophila melanogaster life cycle,18202834,10.1007/s12011-007-8080-9,"An assessment of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in 25 soil samples collected near busy roads in Irbid city, Jordan indicated contamination of these soil samples with different concentrations of 624, 1.243, 242, and 847 microg/g for Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn, respectively. The survival percentage of Drosophila melanogaster third-instar larvae on synthetic medium containing these concentrations for the first generation shows a significant reduction in their growth and development or metamorphosis for most soil extracts. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in survival growth and development in the second generation. The survival percentages of the second generation at pupa stage was higher than the first generation, whereas at the adult stage, there was a lower survival percentage indicating some effects on metamorphosis caused by concentration of heavy metals on Drosophila melanogaster.",2008,"Adnan Massadeh, Fouad Al-Momani, Ahmed Elbetieha, Adnan Massadeh, Fouad Al-Momani, Ahmed Elbetieha"
"Developmental analysis of Ganaspis xanthopoda, a larval parasitoid of Drosophila melanogaster",10377270,,"Ganaspis xanthopoda is a solitary larval parasitoid wasp of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The life cycle of Ganaspis xanthopoda in the wild-type and developmental mutant ecdysoneless strains of Drosophila melanogaster is described. The female infects a second-instar host larva. The parasitoid embryo hatches into a mobile first-instar (L1) larva. The L1 parasitoid has fleshy appendages and, while mobile, it remains confined within the wandering larval host. The second-instar larva (L2) is an endoparasite within the host prepupa and lacks appendages. The L2-to-L3 molt is dependent on pupation and marks the transition of the endoparasite into an ectoparasite. The third-instar larva (L3) is a sessile ectoparasite, develops an extensive tracheal system and consumes the host as it progresses through its prepupal and pupal stages. A single adult male or female emerges from the host puparium. The developmental analysis of Ganaspis xanthopoda reveals a tight synchrony between host and parasitoid development which is, at least in part, dependent on the ecdysone levels of the host.",1999,"J P Melk, S Govind, J P Melk, S Govind"
Chromosomal effects on peptidase activities in Drosophila melanogaster,8471022,10.1007/BF02399818,"The peptidase system in Drosophila melanogaster (dipeptidase-A, -B, and -C and leucine aminopeptidases G and P) was used as a model to study the effects of modifier genes on activity of enzymes with similar functions. A screen of X, second, and third chromosome substitution isogenic lines revealed the presence of activity modifiers for peptidases on all three chromosomes. Correlation analyses indicated that covariation between some of the peptidase activities is independent of genetic background, while others are associated with variable second chromosomes. Chromosome-specific effects on Km, Vmax, and specific activity of partially purified peptidases were also detected. Moreover, a repeatable technique using anion-exchange column chromatography allowed the characterization of possibly two putative peptidic enzymes, glycyl-L-isoleucine-ase and L-leucyl-L-proline-ase, whose kinetic properties differ from the dipeptidases and the leucine aminopeptidases.

The sensitivity of dry weight at eclosion to the difference between rich and poor larval food was selected using differences in sensitivities among families. For both experiments, the correlated response to selection of age at eclosion was examined. The flies were derived from wild populations and had been mass cultured in the lab for more than six months before the experiments started. These flies responded to selection on body weight upwards and downwards on both rich and poor larval food.

Ribosomal DNA and its expression in Drosophila melanogaster during growth and development,823401,10.1007/BF00267574,"Ribosomal DNA content has been determined in several adult and larval tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. Underreplication of rRNA genes was observed in polytenic salivary glands of larvae. On the contrary, polytenic/polyploid ovaries showed no decrease in rDNA. It is concluded that polyteny is not necessarily associated with underreplication of rDNA. No other tissue examined displayed any change in rDNA redundancy. Third-instar-larvae showed a decrease in rDNA amount which might be partly accounted for by underreplication of rDNA in salivary glands. No such decrease was seen in pupae. Bobbed genotypes were essentially similar to wild type in all tissues except salivary glands. In this case, it was found that the extent of underreplication is less in bobbed as compared to wild genotypes. Ribosomal DNA activity was examined in various tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. The rates of rRNA synthesis vary greatly between various tissues. It is concluded that a control at the level of gene activity operates as differences in the amount of precursor rRNA synthesized can be observed both in flies of varying rDNA contents as well as in various tissues of the same genotype.",1976,"J Mohan, J Mohan"

Sterols as dietary markers for Drosophila melanogaster,32169653,10.1016/j.bbalip.2020.158683,"During cold acclimation fruit flies switch their feeding from yeast to plant food, however there are no robust molecular markers to monitor this in the wild. Drosophila melanogaster is a sterol auxotroph and relies on dietary sterols to produce lipid membranes, lipoproteins and molting hormones. We employed shotgun lipidomics to quantify eight major food sterols in total lipid extracts of heads and genital tracts of adult male and female flies. We found that their sterol composition is dynamic and reflective of fly diet in an organ-specific manner. Season-dependent changes observed in the organs of wild-living flies suggested that the molar ratio between yeast (ergosterol, zymosterol) and plant (sitosterol, stigmasterol) sterols is a quantifiable, generic and unequivocal marker of their feeding behavior suitable for ecological and environmental population-based studies.

[Contribution of the SuUR gene to the organization of epigenetically repressed regions of Drosophila melanogaster chromosomes],17025152,,"A significant portion of a eukaryotic genome is silent (epigenetically repressed). In Drosophila melanogaster, this portion includes mainly regions of pericentric and intercalary heterochromatin and euchromatin regions subject to position-effect variegation. Detailed study of the organization of intercalary heterochromatin regions of Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosomes started from the discovery of the SuUR gene (Suppressor of UnderReplication). The ability of the SuUR mutation to suppress underreplication in intercalary heterochromatin regions was used for molecular tagging of these regions. We showed that underreplicated intercalary heterochromatin regions contained silent unique genes and retained the features of late replication and transcriptionally inactive chromatin state in various cell types. Over 50% of these regions contain unique genes clustered on the base of coordinated expression. The origin of clusters and putative mechanisms of their gene expression are discussed.

The synthesis of 5S RNA and its relationship to 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA in the bobbed mutants of Drosophila melanogaster,814039,,"Ribosomes contain one molecule each of 5S, 18S and 28S RNA. In Drosophila melanogaster although the genes for 18S + 28S are physically separated from the 5S RNA genes, the multiplicity of various ribosomal RNA genes is roughly the same. Thus a coordinate synthesis of these three molecules might seem feasible. This problem has been approached by determining the molar ratios of various RNA's in ovaries and in adult flies. In ovaries there is a slight excess of 5S RNA molecules over other rRNA's, but in adult flies no such differences exist. Bobbed mutants also have the same molar ratios as wild-type flies. Results on 5S RNA synthesis in both in vitro and in vivo studies show that it is reduced in coordination with 18S + 28S rRNA in the bobbed mutants of Drosophila melanogaster. Various possibilities are discussed in considering the implications of these results.",1975,"J Mohan, J Mohan"

Development and evolution at the lower temperature both resulted in higher thorax length and wing area. The evolutionary effect of temperature on wing area was entirely a consequence of an increase in cell area. The developmental response was mainly attributable to an increase in cell area, with a small effect on cell number in males. Given its similarity to the evolutionary response, the increase in body size and cell size resulting from development at low temperature may be a case of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The pattern of plasticity did not evolve in response to temperature for any of the traits.

Epigenetic mechanisms modulate differences in Drosophila foraging behavior,29078350,10.1073/pnas.1710770114,"Little is known about how genetic variation and epigenetic marks interact to shape differences in behavior. The foraging (for) gene regulates behavioral differences between the rover and sitter Drosophila melanogaster strains, but the molecular mechanisms through which it does so have remained elusive. We show that the epigenetic regulator G9a interacts with for to regulate strain-specific adult foraging behavior through allele-specific histone methylation of a for promoter (pr4). Rovers have higher pr4 H3K9me dimethylation, lower pr4 RNA expression, and higher foraging scores than sitters. The rover-sitter differences disappear in the presence of G9a null mutant alleles, showing that G9a is necessary for these differences. Furthermore, rover foraging scores can be phenocopied by transgenically reducing pr4 expression in sitters. This compelling evidence shows that genetic variation can interact with an epigenetic modifier to produce differences in gene expression, establishing a behavioral polymorphism in Drosophila.",2017,"Ina Anreiter, Jamie M Kramer, Marla B Sokolowski, Ina Anreiter, Jamie M Kramer, Marla B Sokolowski"

Phenotypic plasticity in response to dietary salt stress: Na+ and K+ transport by the gut of Drosophila melanogaster larvae,22246255,10.1242/jeb.064048,"Drosophila provides a useful model system for studies of the mechanisms involved in regulation of internal ion levels in response to variations in dietary salt load. This study assessed whether alterations in Na(+) and K(+) transport by the gut of larval D. melanogaster reared on salt-rich diets contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation. Na(+) and K(+) fluxes across the isolated guts of third instar larvae reared on control or salt-rich diets were measured using the scanning ion-selective electrode technique (SIET). K(+) absorption across the anterior portion of the posterior midgut of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of KCl was increased 0.4 mol l(-1) above that in the control diet was reduced eightfold relative to the same gut segment of larvae reared on the control diet. There was also an increase in the magnitude and extent of K(+) secretion across the posterior half of the posterior midgut. Na(+) was absorbed across the ileum of larvae reared on the control diet, but was secreted across the ileum of larvae reared on diet in which the concentration of NaCl was increased 0.4 mol l(-1) above that in the control diet. There was also a small reduction in the extent of Na(+) absorption across the middle midgut of larvae reared on the NaCl-rich diet. The results indicate considerable phenotypic plasticity with respect to K(+) and Na(+) transport by the gut epithelia of larval D. melanogaster. SIET measurements of K(+) and Na(+) fluxes along the length of the gut show that ion transport mechanisms of the gut are reconfigured during salt stress so that there are reductions in K(+) and Na(+) absorption and increases in K(+) and Na(+) secretion. Together with previously described changes in salt secretion by the Malpighian tubules, these changes contribute to haemolymph ionoregulation.",2012,"Wida Naikkhwah, Michael J O'Donnell, Wida Naikkhwah, Michael J O'Donnell"
Analysis of Drosophila cGMP-dependent protein kinases and assessment of their in vivo roles by targeted expression in a renal transporting epithelium,15218025,10.1074/jbc.M405619200,"cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) forms encoded by the dg2 (for) gene are implicated in behavior and epithelial transport in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we provide the first biochemical characterization and cellular localization of cGKs encoded by the major transcripts of dg2: dg2P1 and dg2P2. cGMP stimulates kinase activity of DG2P1 (EC(50): 0.13 +/- 0.039 microm) and DG2P2 (EC(50): 0.32 +/- 0.14 microm) in Malpighian tubule and S2 cell extracts. DG2P1 and DG2P2 are magnesium-requiring enzymes and were inhibited by 10 and 100 microm of a cGK inhibitor, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp isomer; whereas DG1, the cGK encoded by the D. melanogaster dg1 gene, was unaffected. DG2P1 and DG2P2 were localized in the plasma membrane in S2 cells, whereas DG1 was localized in the cytosol. The D. melanogaster fluid-transporting Malpighian tubule was used as an organotypic model to analyze cGK localization and function in vivo. Targeted expression of DG2P2, DG2P1, and DG1 in tubule cells via the UAS/GAL4 system in transgenic flies revealed differential localization of all three cGKs in vivo: DG2P2 expression at the apical membrane; DG2P1 expression at both the apical and basolateral membranes; and DG1 expression at the basolateral membrane and in the cytosol. Transgenic tubules for all three cGKs displayed enhanced cGK activity compared with wild-type tubules. The physiological impact of targeted expression of individual cGKs in tubule principal cells was assessed by measuring basal and stimulated rates of fluid transport. DG1 expression greatly enhanced fluid transport by the tubule in response to exogenous cGMP, whereas DG2P2 expression significantly increased fluid transport in response to the nitridergic neuropeptide, capa-1. Thus, dg2-encoded proteins are bona fide cGKs, which have differential roles in epithelial fluid transport, as assessed by in vivo studies. Furthermore, a novel epithelial role is suggested for DG1, which is considerably more responsive to cGMP than to capa-1 stimulation.",2004,"Matthew R MacPherson, Suzanne M Lohmann, Shireen-A Davies, Matthew R MacPherson, Suzanne M Lohmann, Shireen-A Davies"
The promoters and spacers in the rDNAs of the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila,2502472,10.1016/0378-1119(89)90075-9,"The spacer sequences of rDNAs of members of the melanogaster species subgroup of Drosophila (melanogaster, simulans, mauritiana, teissieri, and yakuba) have been compared. The external transcribed spacers (ETSs; the region encoding the 5' end of the primary transcript, upstream from the 18S sequences) are highly conserved between in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. mauritiana, whereas the more distantly related D. yakuba and D. teissieri differ in having apparent deletions of 22 and 27 bp, respectively, in this region. The divergence of nucleotide sequence upstream from the transcription start points is consistent with the established phylogeny of the five species. The sequences between bp positions -47 and +24 from the primary transcription start point show extremely little variation between each species. This is also the case for sequences between the approximate bp positions -140 to -125 and -85 to -70. This could indicate a functional importance not only of the sequences next to the transcription start point, but also of these upstream regions. An array of 240-bp repeats can be found at a comparable distance upstream from the transcription start point in each species. Matrix homology comparisons indicate that for each species not only is the sequence at the primary transcription start point duplicated within the 240-bp repeats as previously reported for D. melanogaster, but that this is part of a longer interrupted duplication which includes a region of strong similarity with the sequence between the approximate positions -105 to -65. This region is contained within one of the regions upstream from the transcription start point that is strongly conserved between the species. This sequence may therefore have functional significance not only for the transcription of the rRNA precursor, but also for transcription of the so-called NTS sequences which is now known to occur. The 240-bp arrays are themselves highly conserved within a species indicating that homogenisation mechanisms are operative. The divergence of these arrays between species is consistent with the phylogenetic tree. The 3' sequences of the primary transcription unit, now known to be RNA-processing sites, are also highly similar between the species. Immediately downstream from these sites there is little homology between the rDNA of the different species, until 95-bp tandem arrays are reached in each case.",1989,"D C Hayward, D M Glover, D C Hayward, D M Glover"
Using comparative genomic hybridization to survey genomic sequence divergence across species: a proof-of-concept from Drosophila,20429934,10.1186/1471-2164-11-271,"Background:
      
    

    
      Genome-wide analysis of sequence divergence among species offers profound insights into the evolutionary processes that shape lineages. When full-genome sequencing is not feasible for a broad comparative study, we propose the use of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in order to identify orthologous genes with high sequence divergence. Here we discuss experimental design, statistical power, success rate, sources of variation and potential confounding factors. We used a spotted PCR product microarray platform from Drosophila melanogaster to assess sequence divergence on a gene-by-gene basis in three fully sequenced heterologous species (D. sechellia, D. simulans, and D. yakuba). Because complete genome assemblies are available for these species this study presents a powerful test for the use of aCGH as a tool to measure sequence divergence.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      We found a consistent and linear relationship between hybridization ratio and sequence divergence of the sample to the platform species. At higher levels of sequence divergence (< 92% sequence identity to D. melanogaster) approximately 84% of features had significantly less hybridization to the array in the heterologous species than the platform species, and thus could be identified as ""diverged"". At lower levels of divergence (>or= 97% identity), only 13% of genes were identified as diverged. While approximately 40% of the variation in hybridization ratio can be accounted for by variation in sequence identity of the heterologous sample relative to D. melanogaster, other individual characteristics of the DNA sequences, such as GC content, also contribute to variation in hybridization ratio, as does technical variation.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Here we demonstrate that aCGH can accurately be used as a proxy to estimate genome-wide divergence, thus providing an efficient way to evaluate how evolutionary processes and genomic architecture can shape species diversity in non-model systems. Given the increased number of species for which microarray platforms are available, comparative studies can be conducted for many interesting lineages in order to identify highly diverged genes that may be the target of natural selection.",2010,"Suzy C P Renn, Heather E Machado, Albyn Jones, Kosha Soneji, Rob J Kulathinal, Hans A Hofmann, Suzy C P Renn, Heather E Machado, Albyn Jones, Kosha Soneji, Rob J Kulathinal, Hans A Hofmann"

Mobile genetic elements in animal cells and their biological significance,6209137,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08541.x,"Mobile genetic elements were discovered by McClintock while analysing unstable mutations in maize. The structural and functional studies of such elements became possible after their cloning, first from the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. In particular, Ilyin et al. demonstrated the varying location of the described elements in D. melanogaster chromosomes, thus providing the first evidence of their mobility. Mobile elements comprise a significant part of the genetic material in D. melanogaster (not less than 10%). Several classes of mobile elements do exist. Mobile dispersed genetic elements (mdg elements) are among the best characterized ones. Mdg elements are represented in the genome by dozens of families, each consisting of 10-150 copies. They are very similar structurally to proviruses of endogenous retroviruses. In particular, the both contain long terminal repeats (LTRs). The nucleotide sequences of LTRs and their flanking sequences of several mdg elements were determined. Their analysis suggested that RNA reverse transcription should be involved in the mdg amplification. It has been found that putative transposition intermediates, i.e. extrachromosomal DNA copies of mdg elements, are synthesized by reverse transcriptase in D. melanogaster culture cells. Another type of mobile genes is represented by P factor and similar elements. P factor seems to encode 'transposase' participating in direct excision and insertion of P elements themselves as well as of other mobile genes (mdg and fold-back elements). Besides these 'active transposons' which encode the enzyme machinery for transposition, a number of other sequences which may be transposed are present in the genome. RNAs synthesized on such elements can serve as a template for reverse transcriptase, and the DNA formed can then be inserted at new sites of the genome. Among such sequences are the so-called short ubiquitous repeats: B1 and B2 in mouse genome and Alu in human genome. We found that, at least in several cases, B-type sequences were located at the 3' end of mRNA. Short repetitive sequences were also detected at the 3' end of certain mRNAs of D. melanogaster. Usually the transpositions of mobile genes occur very rarely. However, under certain conditions, for example, in hybrid dysgenesis, they become more frequent. The strain with a mutation in cut locus was obtained in hybrid dysgenesis. This mutation depends on an insertion of mdg4 at the cut locus. Genetic instability in this strain is maintained for a long time. 'Transposition bursts' were found to occur in some germ cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1984,"G P Georgiev, G P Georgiev"

Simple Homemade Tools to Handle Fruit Flies-Drosophila melanogaster,31403618,10.3791/59613,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is widely used both in biological research and biology education. Handling adult flies is common but difficult in practice, as adult flies fly. Demonstrated here is how to make some simple and cost-effective tools to address difficult issues in the handling of Drosophila. Holes in foam stoppers are made and pipette tips or funnels are inserted into the holes. Flies then move only in one direction into the pipette tip/funnel assemblage, allowing efficient control of the transfer of adult Drosophila into or out of a vial. Existing protocols have been modified for cool-anesthetizing flies by chilling in crushed ice and transferring them onto a cold, hard icepack surface. The icepack is covered with a piece of medical gauze that keeps immobilized flies from the condensed water when examined under a stereomicroscope.

GC levels of introns and flanking sequences are correlated with GC(3) values (GC levels of third codon positions) of the corresponding genes with slopes much lower than unity; in other words, most introns and intergenic sequences are less GC-rich than the corresponding GC(3) values. These findings, which describe a compositional shift within Diptera, is of interest because of their parallels in the well studied major shift in vertebrates.",2004,"Kamel Jabbari, Giorgio Bernardi, Kamel Jabbari, Giorgio Bernardi"
The effects of catalase gene overexpression on life span and resistance to oxidative stress in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster,1379030,10.1016/0003-9861(92)90637-c,"Oxygen free radicals and hydroperoxides have been postulated to play a causal role in the aging process, implying that antioxidant enzymes may act as longevity determinants. Catalase (H2O2:H2O2 oxidoreductase; EC1.11.1.6) is the sole enzyme involved in the elimination of H2O2 in Drosophila melanogaster; glutathione peroxidase being absent. A genomic fragment containing the Drosophila catalase gene was used to construct transgenic Drosophila lines by means of P element-mediated transformation. Enhanced levels of catalase (up to 80%) did not prolong the life span of flies, nor did they provide improved protection against oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia or paraquat treatment. However, enhanced resistance to hydrogen peroxide was observed in the overexpressors.",1992,"W C Orr, R S Sohal, W C Orr, R S Sohal"
Characterization and purification of DNA-RNA complexes related with 1731 and copia-like transposable elements in a Drosophila cell line,1703922,,"DNA-RNA complexes were characterized and purified in a Drosophila melanogaster cell line.

They incorporated both labelled thymidine and uridine and their resistance or sensibility to enzymes or chemicals was consistent with that being expected with such hybrid molecules. From that intermediate form of reverse transcription, the resulting labelled cDNAs were obtained and were shown to be homologous to different drosophila ""copia-like"" transposable elements.

On the accuracy of protein synthesis in Drosophila melanogaster,6790882,10.1016/0047-6374(81)90089-0,"We have investigated the accuracy of protein synthesis in somatic tissue of young and senescent Drosophila melanogaster by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis. Electrophoretic heterogeneity characteristic of translational error could not be detected at either age, placing the error frequency below about 4 X 10(-4) per codon. As a positive control on the efficacy of the technique, we showed that electrophoretic heterogeneity is detectable in bacterial cells grown in streptomycin, and that the error frequency calculated from these data is in good agreement with independent measurements. Such cells can tolerate an error frequency of about 3 x 10(-3) without cell lethality, or error catastrophe. Since the Drosophila somatic error frequency is at least eight times lower, even in senescent organisms, translational error is unlikely to be a cause of senescence in Drosophila.",1981,"J Parker, J Flanagan, J Murphy, J Gallant, J Parker, J Flanagan, J Murphy, J Gallant"
Development of three Drosophila melanogaster strains with different sensitivity to volatile anesthetics,19323908,,"Background:
      
    

    
      The mechanisms of action for volatile anesthetics remain unknown for centuries partly owing to the insufficient or ineffective research models. We designed this study to develop three strains derived from a wild-type Drosophila melanogaster with different sensitivities to volatile anesthetics, which may ultimately facilitate molecular and genetic studies of the mechanism involved.
    

    
  


        Methods:
      
    

    
      Median effective doses (ED(50)) of sevoflurane in seven-day-old virgin female and male wild-type Drosophila melanogaster were determined. The sensitive males and females of percentile 6 - 10 were cultured for breeding sensitive offspring (S(1)). So did median ones of percentile 48 - 52 for breeding median offspring (M(1)), resistant ones of percentile 91 - 95 for breeding resistant offspring (R(1)). Process was repeated through 31 generations, in the 37th generation, S(37), M(37) and R(37) were used to determine ED(50) for enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, halothane, methoxyflurane, chloroform and trichloroethylene, then ED(50) values were correlated with minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) values in human.
    

    
  


        Results:
      
    

    
      From a wild-type Drosophila melanogaster we were able to breed three strains with high, median and low sevoflurane requirements. The ratio of sevoflurane requirements of three strains were 1.20:1.00:0.53 for females and 1.22:1.00:0.72 for males. Strains sensitive, median and resistant to sevoflurane were also sensitive, median and resistant to other volatile anesthetics. For eight anesthetics, ED(50) values in three strains correlated directly with MAC values in human.
    

    
  


        Conclusions:
      
    

    
      Three Drosophila melanogaster strains with high, median and low sensitivity to volatile anesthetics, but with same hereditary background were developed. The ED(50) are directly correlated with MAC in human for eight volatile anesthetics.",2009,"Jin Liu, Zhao-yang Hu, Qi-quan Ye, Shuo-hua Dai, Jin Liu, Zhao-yang Hu, Qi-quan Ye, Shuo-hua Dai"
Sex-specific transcriptomic responses to changes in the nutritional environment,31436529,10.7554/eLife.47262,"Males and females typically pursue divergent reproductive strategies and accordingly require different dietary compositions to maximise their fitness. Here we move from identifying sex-specific optimal diets to understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie male and female responses to dietary variation in Drosophila melanogaster. We examine male and female gene expression on male-optimal (carbohydrate-rich) and female-optimal (protein-rich) diets. We find that the sexes share a large core of metabolic genes that are concordantly regulated in response to dietary composition. However, we also observe smaller sets of genes with divergent and opposing regulation, most notably in reproductive genes which are over-expressed on each sex's optimal diet. Our results suggest that nutrient sensing output emanating from a shared metabolic machinery are reversed in males and females, leading to opposing diet-dependent regulation of reproduction in males and females. Further analysis and experiments suggest that this reverse regulation occurs within the IIS/TOR network.",2019,"M Florencia Camus, Matthew Dw Piper, Max Reuter, M Florencia Camus, Matthew Dw Piper, Max Reuter"
Evidence that the radioprotector effect of ascorbic acid depends on the radiation dose rate,30081379,10.1016/j.etap.2018.07.015,"Many studies have revealed that ascorbic acid (Aa) acts as a powerful inhibitor of genetic damage.

After pretreatment, larvae were irradiated with 20 Gy of gamma rays administered at 36 or 960 Gy/h. Toxicity, development rate and frequency of mutant spots were recorded. Results provide evidence of a radioprotective effect for all tested concentrations of Aa only when 20 Gy were delivered at 36 Gy/h and only with 25 mM using the 960 Gy/h.

Regionalization of surface lipids in insects,27170708,10.1098/rspb.2015.2994,"Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) play a critical role in the establishment of the waterproof barrier that prevents dehydration and wetting in insects. While rich data are available on CHC composition in different species, we know little about their distribution and organization. Here, we report on our studies of the surface barrier of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster applying a newly developed Eosin Y staining method. The inert Eosin Y penetrates different regions of the adult body at distinct temperatures. By contrast, the larval body takes up the dye rather uniformly and gradually with increasing temperature. Cooling down specimens to 25°C after incubation at higher temperatures restores impermeability. Eosin Y penetration is also sensitive to lipid solvents such as chloroform indicating that permeability depends on CHCs. As in D. melanogaster adult flies, Eosin Y penetration is regionalized in Tenebrio molitor larvae, whereas it is not in Locusta migratoria nymphs. Regionalization of the fly surface implies tissue-specific variation of the genetic or biochemical programmes of CHC production and deposition. The Eosin Y-based map of CHC distribution may serve to identify the respective factors that are activated to accommodate ecological needs.",2016,"Yiwen Wang, Zhitao Yu, Jianzhen Zhang, Bernard Moussian, Yiwen Wang, Zhitao Yu, Jianzhen Zhang, Bernard Moussian"

Using model organisms and various approaches several genes have been linked to the longevity phenotype. For Drosophila melanogaster those studies have usually focussed on one sex and on flies originating from one genetic background, and results from different studies often do not overlap. Using D. melanogaster selected for increased longevity we aimed to find robust longevity related genes by examining gene expression in both sexes of flies originating from different genetic backgrounds. Further, we compared expression changes across three ages, when flies were young, middle aged or old, to examine how candidate gene expression changes with the onset of ageing. We selected 10 genes based on their expression differences in prior microarray studies. For about 50% of these we confirmed their potential as a candidate longevity gene. We found one robust candidate gene for longevity, CG32638.

Our results suggests that the polytene and interphase cell line chromosomes have practically the same patterns of bands and interbands reflecting, probably, the basic principle of interphase chromosome organization.

Mutants exhibit endogenous seizure-like activity, indicating altered neuronal excitability. However, at the synaptic level, stj larval neuromuscular junctions exhibit approximately fourfold reduction in synaptic release compared with controls stemming from a reduced release probability at these synapses. These defects likely stem from destabilization of Cacophony (Cac), the primary presynaptic alpha(1) subunit in D. melanogaster.

We generated multiple fusions between DE-cadherin and alpha-catenin as well as point-mutated beta-catenin and analyzed their ability to support these types of adhesion. We found that (1) although linking DE-cadherin to alpha-catenin is essential, regulation of the link is not required in any of these types of adhesion; (2) beta-catenin is required only to link DE-cadherin to alpha-catenin; and (3) the cytoplasmic domain of DE-cadherin has an additional specific function for the invasive migration of border cells, which is conserved to other cadherins.

Regulation of EGF receptor signaling in the fruitfly D. melanogaster and the nematode C. elegans,15687590,10.3233/bd-1999-11103,"Mammals contain four members (HER1/EGFR, HER2/Neu, HER3, and HER4) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, which transduce extracellular signals by EGF family peptide growth factors.

Amplification and/or uncontrolled signaling of these receptors is associated with many cancers. 10 to 34% of human breast cancers are associated with amplification or overexpression of the HER2/neu oncogene, an EGFR homolog [1]. Signaling from the EGFR plays a critical role in the development of many organisms including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, each of which contain a single EGFR homolog.

Specificity of chromosome damage caused by the Rex element of Drosophila melanogaster,8878677,,"Rex is a multicopy genetic element that maps within an X-linked ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) array of D. melanogaster.

With target chromosomes that contain two rDNA arrays, the exchanges either delete all of the material between the two arrays or invert the entire intervening chromosomal segment. About a third of the embryos produced by Rex homozygotes have cytologically visible chromosome damage, nearly always involving a single chromosome. Most of these embryos die during early development, displaying a characteristic apoptosis-like phenotype. An experiment that tests whether the cytologically visible damage is rDNA-specific is reported here. In this experiment, females heterozygous for Rex and an rDNA-deficient X chromosome were crossed to males of two genotypes. Some of the progeny from the experimental cross entirely lacked rDNA, while all of the progeny from the control cross had at least one rDNA array. A significantly lower frequency of early-lethal embryos in the experimental cross, proportionate to the fraction of rDNA-deficient embryos, demonstrates that Rex preferentially damages rDNA.",1996,"L G Robbins, L G Robbins"

Furthermore, hobo transposition was detected in H. zea embryos in a manner consistent with that seen for the cell line. In both cases, transposition/excision was found to be independent of vector-encoded transposase functions, indicating that endogenous genes are involved in hobo mobility. Finally, we demonstrate the stable insertion of the bacterial lacZ gene into the H. zea genome. These data demonstrate that hobo elements are capable of transgressing species boundaries and functioning in non-drosophilid cellular environments.

Three insertions were found in the gene region but only one affected GPDH activity. The lines with the duplication had higher levels of GPDH activity and protein amount than did nonduplicated lines. This effect was also observed in lines extracted from two other Australian populations. The duplication is shown to have a similar structure in each population investigated and is also present in populations from China and Africa.

Subsequent sampling by others in Japan and western U.S.A. has failed to repeat this observation for the steepest of the clines (alcohol dehydrogenase and the four chromosome inversions). We argue that this failure reflects the few populations and small latitudinal range sampled in these later studies. From extensive sampling over a long latitudinal transect in Australasia we here document Adh and inversion clines which are virtually identical to those originally obtained in different Australian populations four years earlier. We also repeat our observation that the Adh cline is largely independent of the cline in the linked inversion In(2L)t. We therefore retain our original conclusion that these polymorphisms are subject to natural selection. However the new Australasian data do not indicate an association between Adh and maximum rainfall which had been evident in the earlier data for Australasia, Asia and North America.

To comprehensively determine how Hippo signalling interacts with other pathways in this regulation, we screened all known signalling pathway genes, and identified Hpo-dependent and Hpo-independent signalling requirements. Network analysis of known protein-protein interactions among screen results identified independent gene regulatory sub-networks regulating one or both of ovariole number and egg laying. These sub-networks predict involvement of previously uncharacterised genes with higher accuracy than the original candidate screen.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the active site cysteine311 to alanine in D. melanogaster SSADH leads to an inactive product binding both SSA aldehyde and gem-diol. Thus, the residue cysteine311 is crucial for their discrimination. STD experiments on SSADH and NAD(+)/NADP(+) indicate differential affinity in agreement with the respective cosubstrate properties. Epitope mapping by STD points to a strong interaction of the NAD(+)/NADP(+) adenine H2 proton with SSADH. Adenine H8, nicotinamide H2, H4, and H6 also show STD signals.

Two or four bristles: functional evolution of an enhancer of scute in Drosophilidae,17105353,10.1371/journal.pbio.0040386,"Changes in cis-regulatory sequences are proposed to underlie much of morphological evolution. Yet, little is known about how such modifications translate into phenotypic differences. To address this problem, we focus on the dorsocentral bristles of Drosophilidae. In Drosophila melanogaster, development of these bristles depends on a cis-regulatory element, the dorsocentral enhancer, to activate scute in a cluster of cells from which two bristles on the posterior scutum arise. A few species however, such as D. quadrilineata, bear anterior dorsocentral bristles as well as posterior ones, a derived feature. This correlates with an anterior expansion of the scute expression domain. Here, we show that the D. quadrilineata enhancer has evolved, and is now active in more anterior regions. When used to rescue scute expression in transgenic D. melanogaster, the D. quadrilineata enhancer is able to induce anterior bristles. Importantly, these properties are not displayed by homologous enhancers from control species bearing only two posterior bristles. We also provide evidence that upstream regulation of the enhancer, by the GATA transcription factor Pannier, has been evolutionarily conserved. This work illustrates how, in the context of a conserved trans-regulatory landscape, evolutionary tinkering of pre-existing enhancers can modify gene expression patterns and contribute to morphological diversification.",2006,"Sylvain Marcellini, Pat Simpson, Sylvain Marcellini, Pat Simpson"

We report that the illumination of dark-raised flies triggers the dissociation of Dmoesin from the light-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) and TRP-like channels, followed by the migration of Dmoesin from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we show that light-activated migration of Dmoesin results from the dephosphorylation of a conserved threonine in Dmoesin. The expression of a Dmoesin mutant form that impairs this phosphorylation inhibits Dmoesin movement and leads to light-induced retinal degeneration.

A method of tag mapping is described here and applied to the Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, which permits detailed SAGE assessment and provides tag-mapping resources that were unavailable previously for these organisms. In our method, a conceptual transcriptome is constructed using genomic sequence and annotation by extending predicted coding regions to include UTRs on the basis of EST and cDNA alignments, UTR length distributions, and polyadenylation signals. Analysis of extracted tags suggests that, using the standard SAGE procedure, expression of 8% of D. melanogaster and 15% of C. elegans genes cannot be detected unambiguously by SAGE due to shared sequence or lack of NlaIII-anchoring enzyme sites. Both increasing tag length by 2-3 bp and using Sau3A instead of NlaIII as the anchoring enzyme increases potential for transcript detection. This work identifies and quantifies genes not amenable to SAGE analysis, in addition to providing tag-to-gene mappings for two model organisms.",2003,"Erin D Pleasance, Marco A Marra, Steven J M Jones, Erin D Pleasance, Marco A Marra, Steven J M Jones"
Prolonged negative selection of Drosophila melanogaster for a character of adaptive significance disturbs stress reactivity,10380656,10.1016/s0965-1748(99)00021-1,"The metabolism of juvenile hormone by JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase, and octopamine by tyrosine decarboxylase were studied under normal and stress conditions in flies of two related lines of D. melanogaster. One was selected for high (HA line) and another for low (LA line) male sexual activity for more than 700 generations. It was demonstrated that prolonged selection for low male sexual activity results in considerable changes in both systems. Tyrosine decarboxylase activity in males and females of the LA line was sharply reduced as compared with those of the HA and control Canton-S lines; JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase activities were decreased in females, and not in males, of the LA line. It was demonstrated that the response of both metabolic systems to heat stress is impaired in individuals of the LA line: the system of juvenile hormone metabolism does not respond to stress, and that of octopamine metabolism is decelerated. The role of juvenile hormone metabolism in male reproductive function is discussed.",1999,"N E Gruntenko, T M Khlebodarova, Sukhanova MJh, I A Vasenkova, L Z Kaidanov, Rauschenbach IYu, N E Gruntenko, T M Khlebodarova, Sukhanova MJh, I A Vasenkova, L Z Kaidanov, Rauschenbach IYu"
Simple plaque hybridization method for the detection of differentially represented repetitive DNA,7727126,,"A differential DNA hybridization method of detecting moderately repetitive strain-specific or species-specific DNA is described. Two Drosophila melanogaster strains, one with and one without transposable elements, were utilized as a model system to demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure. A genomic library was constructed from flies of the pi 2 strain, which contains both P and hobo transposable elements. Duplicate plaque lifts of this library were probed with DNA from the same strain and with DNA from the Canton-S strain, which contains neither of these two families of transposable elements. Plaques that hybridized stronger to the genomic DNA that contained elements were noted, and then the filters were stripped and reprobed with P and hobo element DNA. Many of the differentially hybridizing plaques were shown to contain DNA homologous to one of the two known elements. This method should allow the isolation and cloning of any repetitive DNA present in one species or isolate, but absent or present in reduced copy number in another species or isolate. By analogy to the recent invasion of D. melanogaster by P elements, such differentially represented DNA is likely to represent recently invading transposable elements that are actively mobile.",1995,"G A Meister, R A Lansman, T A Grigliatti, G A Meister, R A Lansman, T A Grigliatti"
Effects of the apterous4 mutation on Drosophila melanogaster males' courtship,2121922,10.3109/01677069009107112,"The apterous4 (ap4) mutation has pleiotropic effects on the morphology and lifespan of D. melanogaster adults. The mutation also affects one aspect of male sexual behaviour. Unlike normal, sexually mature males, three day old ap4/ap4 males synthesize courtship-stimulating hydrocarbons that immature males make; as a result they elicit vigorous courtship (Jallon and Hotta, 1979; Jallon et al., 1986). Data presented in this report indicate that expression of the apterous4 mutation does not affect all aspects of sexual maturation in males. Specifically, 24-30 hour old ap4/ap4 males are capable of performing all of the courtship behaviors, including abdominal vibration, a newly described response of mutant and wild-type males to virgin females. However, the mutant males spend less time courting and are less likely to perform some of the courtship behaviours than age-matched controls. These abnormalities are probably indirect effects of the apterous4 allele's previously unreported effects on the flies' motor functions, which include partial paralysis, lack of coordination, and sluggishness.",1990,"L Tompkins, L Tompkins"
The Drosophila melanogaster Ortholog of RFWD3 Functions Independently of RAD51 During DNA Repair,31900333,10.1534/g3.119.400903,"Repair of damaged DNA is required for the viability of all organisms. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster, driven by the power of genetic screens, pioneered the discovery and characterization of many genes and pathways involved in DNA repair in animals. However, fewer than half of the alleles identified in these screens have been mapped to a specific gene, leaving a potential for new discoveries in this field. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized mutagen sensitive gene mus302 codes for the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger and WD domain protein 3 (RFWD3). In human cells, RFWD3 promotes ubiquitylation of RPA and RAD51 to facilitate repair of collapsed replication forks and double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. Despite the high similarity in sequence to the human ortholog, our evidence fails to support a role for Mus302 in the repair of these types of damage. Last, we observe that the N-terminal third of RFWD3 is only found in mammals, but not in other vertebrates or invertebrates. We propose that the new N-terminal sequence accounts for the acquisition of a new biological function in mammals that explains the functional differences between the human and the fly orthologs, and that Drosophila Mus302 may retain the ancestral function of the protein.",2020,"Juan Carvajal-Garcia, Evan R Gales, Dale A Ramsden, Jeff Sekelsky, Juan Carvajal-Garcia, Evan R Gales, Dale A Ramsden, Jeff Sekelsky"
The Ran Pathway in Drosophila melanogaster Mitosis,26636083,10.3389/fcell.2015.00074,"Over the last two decades, the small GTPase Ran has emerged as a central regulator of both mitosis and meiosis, particularly in the generation, maintenance, and regulation of the microtubule (MT)-based bipolar spindle. Ran-regulated pathways in mitosis bear many similarities to the well-characterized functions of Ran in nuclear transport and, as with transport, the majority of these mitotic effects are mediated through affecting the physical interaction between karyopherins and Spindle Assembly Factors (SAFs)-a loose term describing proteins or protein complexes involved in spindle assembly through promoting nucleation, stabilization, and/or depolymerization of MTs, through anchoring MTs to specific structures such as centrosomes, chromatin or kinetochores, or through sliding MTs along each other to generate the force required to achieve bipolarity. As such, the Ran-mediated pathway represents a crucial functional module within the wider spindle assembly landscape. Research into mitosis using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has contributed substantially to our understanding of centrosome and spindle function. However, in comparison to mammalian systems, very little is known about the contribution of Ran-mediated pathways in Drosophila mitosis. This article sets out to summarize our understanding of the roles of the Ran pathway components in Drosophila mitosis, focusing on the syncytial blastoderm embryo, arguing that it can provide important insights into the conserved functions on Ran during spindle formation.",2015,"Jack W C Chen, Amy R Barker, James G Wakefield, Jack W C Chen, Amy R Barker, James G Wakefield"
Berberine Attenuated Aging-Accelerating Effect of High Temperature in Drosophila Model,26167393,10.4236/ajps.2014.53037,"We have observed that berberine prolonged life span and improved viability of pupae and climbing activity of imagoes of wild-type Drosophila melanogaster maintained at 23°C. As a continuation of our studies of berberine effect on life span, we were interested to evaluate the effect of berberine of life span in flies maintained at a higher temperature (28°C) known to accelerate aging in wild type flies. Considering that genetically or pharmacologically induced deficiency of TRP conversion into KYN prolonged life span in a Drosophila model, we compared the effects of berberine, a powerful inhibitor of kynurenine (KYN) formation from tryptophan (TRP), on life span in wild type and in Drosophila melanogaster mutants (vermilion) with deficient TRP-KYN metabolism maintained at 23°C and 28°C. High (28°C) ambient temperature decreased life span in both wild type and vermilion flies. Aging accelerating effect of high temperature was more pronounced in Oregon than in vermilion flies (-60% vs. -40% decrease of mean life span, resp). Berberine attenuated the aging-accelerating effect of high temperature. Effect of berberine was more pronounced in Oregon (+46%) than in vermilion (+22%) flies. The obtained data suggested the possible involvement of TRP-KYN metabolism in the aging-acceleration effect of the high temperature and in protective effect of berberine.",2014,"Valeriya Navrotskaya, Gregory Oxenkrug, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad, Valeriya Navrotskaya, Gregory Oxenkrug, Lyudmila Vorobyova, Paul Summergrad"

Especially both sexes of D. simulans, and D. melanogaster males display 7-tricosene (7T) as the major compound type [7T]s and [7T]m, or 7-pentacosene (7P) [7P]s and [7P]m. D. melanogaster females display 7,11-heptacosadiene (7,11HD) as the major compound: [7,11HD]m, or 5,9-heptacosadiene (5,9HD): [5,9HD]m. The [7P]s, [7P]m and [5,9HD]m are mainly present in central Africa. A significant correlation was found between latitude and the proportion of compounds with 23 and 25 carbon atoms, especially 7T and 7P in both sexes of D. melanogaster. [7P]m type of D. melanogaster, characterized with an excess of C25 compounds, presents a higher resistance against desiccation than [7T]m type, where C23 compounds are more abundant. These differences can be correlated with calculated HC fusion temperatures. Moreover, increasing the breeding temperature from 18 to 29 degrees C induces in D. melanogaster males an increase in 25C compounds and a decrease in 23C compounds, but the opposite effect in D. simulans. A mathematical model of biosynthesis, based on kinetics of elongation and decarboxylation enzymes, suggests that a simple variation of the efficiency of an elongation enzyme may account for the differences observed between the [7T]m and [7P]m types of D. melanogaster and [7T]s and [7P]s types D. simulans. Finally on the basis of the geographical distribution of the HC types of both Drosophila species, an evolutionary dispersal pathway is proposed and discussed in relation to the environment and reproductive behavior.",2004,"Jacques-Deric Rouault, Charlotte Marican, Claude Wicker-Thomas, Jean-Marc Jallon, Jacques-Deric Rouault, Charlotte Marican, Claude Wicker-Thomas, Jean-Marc Jallon"

A Burrowing/Tunneling Assay for Detection of Hypoxia in Drosophila melanogaster Larvae,29658928,10.3791/57131,"Oxygen deprivation in animals can result from exposure to low atmospheric oxygen levels or from internal tissue damage that interferes with oxygen distribution. It is also possible that aberrant behavior of oxygen-sensing neurons could induce hypoxia-like behavior in the presence of normal oxygen levels. In D. melanogaster, development at low oxygen levels results in inhibition of growth and sluggish behavior during the larval phases. However, these established manifestations of oxygen deficit overlap considerably with the phenotypes of many mutations that regulate growth, stress responses or locomotion. As result, there is currently no assay available to identify i) cellular hypoxia induced by a mutation or ii) hypoxia-like behavior when induced by abnormal neuronal behavior. We have recently identified two distinctive behaviors in D. melanogaster larvae that occur at normal oxygen levels in response to internal detection of hypoxia. First, at all stages, such larvae avoid burrowing into food, often straying far away from a food source. Second, tunneling into a soft substratum, which normally occurs during the wandering third instar stage is completely abolished if larvae are hypoxic. The assay described here is designed to detect and quantitate these behaviors and thus to provide a way to detect hypoxia induced by internal damage rather than low external oxygen. Assay plates with an agar substratum and a central plug of yeast paste are used to support animals through larval life. The positions and state of the larvae are tracked daily as they proceed from first to third instar. The extent of tunneling into the agar substratum during wandering phase is quantitated after pupation using NIH ImageJ. The assay will be of value in determining when hypoxia is a component of a mutant phenotype and thus provide insight into possible sites of action of the gene in question.",2018,"Karen M Qiang, Fanli Zhou, Kathleen M Beckingham, Karen M Qiang, Fanli Zhou, Kathleen M Beckingham"
APOL1-Mediated Cell Injury Involves Disruption of Conserved Trafficking Processes,27864431,10.1681/ASN.2016050546,"APOL1 harbors C-terminal sequence variants (G1 and G2), which account for much of the increased risk for kidney disease in sub-Saharan African ancestry populations. Expression of the risk variants has also been shown to cause injury to podocytes and other cell types, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We used Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to help clarify these mechanisms. Ubiquitous expression of the human APOL1 G1 and G2 disease risk alleles caused near-complete lethality in D. melanogaster, with no effect of the G0 nonrisk APOL1 allele, corresponding to the pattern of human disease risk. We also observed a congruent pattern of cellular damage with tissue-specific expression of APOL1. In particular, expression of APOL1 risk variants in D. melanogaster nephrocytes caused cell-autonomous accumulation of the endocytic tracer atrial natriuretic factor-red fluorescent protein at early stages and nephrocyte loss at later stages. We also observed differential toxicity of the APOL1 risk variants compared with the APOL1 nonrisk variants in S. cerevisiae, including impairment of vacuole acidification. Yeast strains defective in endosomal trafficking or organelle acidification but not those defective in autophagy displayed augmented APOL1 toxicity with all isoforms. This pattern of differential injury by the APOL1 risk alleles compared with the nonrisk alleles across evolutionarily divergent species is consistent with an impairment of conserved core intracellular endosomal trafficking processes.

Nematode and arthropod genomes provide new insights into the evolution of class 2 B1 GPCRs,24651821,10.1371/journal.pone.0092220,"Nematodes and arthropods are the most speciose animal groups and possess Class 2 B1 G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Existing models of invertebrate Class 2 B1 GPCR evolution are mainly centered on Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster and a few other nematode and arthropod representatives. The present study reevaluates the evolution of metazoan Class 2 B1 GPCRs and orthologues by exploring the receptors in several nematode and arthropod genomes and comparing them to the human receptors. Three novel receptor phylogenetic clusters were identified and designated cluster A, cluster B and PDF-R-related cluster. Clusters A and B were identified in several nematode and arthropod genomes but were absent from D. melanogaster and Culicidae genomes, whereas the majority of the members of the PDF-R-related cluster were from nematodes. Cluster A receptors were nematode and arthropod-specific but shared a conserved gene environment with human receptor loci. Cluster B members were orthologous to human GCGR, PTHR and Secretin members with which they probably shared a common origin. PDF-R and PDF-R related clusters were present in representatives of both nematodes and arthropods. The results of comparative analysis of GPCR evolution and diversity in protostomes confirm previous notions that C. elegans and D. melanogaster genomes are not good representatives of nematode and arthropod phyla. We hypothesize that at least four ancestral Class 2 B1 genes emerged early in the metazoan radiation, which after the protostome-deuterostome split underwent distinct selective pressures that resulted in duplication and deletion events that originated the current Class 2 B1 GPCRs in nematode and arthropod genomes.",2014,"João C R Cardoso, Rute C Félix, Deborah M Power, João C R Cardoso, Rute C Félix, Deborah M Power"
"Genome-wide analysis of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori",21440608,10.1016/j.gene.2011.03.002,"Based on the advances in the silkworm genome project, a new genome-wide analysis of cytochrome P450 genes was performed. A total of 84 CYP-related sequences were identified and could be classified into 26 families and 47 subfamilies according to standard nomenclature. Seventy eight of the eighty four genes appear to be functional and six are probable pseudogenes. The distribution of Bombyx mori P450s in the genome shows that most of them are tandem arranged on chromosomes, only 34 genes are present as singletons, with 8 clusters including 3 or more than 3 genes. Sequence alignments were used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and to analyze the intron-exon organizations of the functional genes. The conserved intron positioning agrees perfectly with their common grouping on the tree. The presence of three extremely ancient introns which are conserved across different clans indicates that a few introns are still highly conserved after they have undergone extensive evolutionary changes of B. mori P450 duplication and divergence. Comparison of the P450s from B. mori to the P450s from Drosophila melanogaster shows that the expansion is not uniform across the gene families. Remarkably, two mitochondrial families, the B. mori CYP333 and D. melanogaster Cyp12, formed two orthologous groups in the phylogenetic tree. All CYP333s can be proposed to be related to xenobiotic metabolism in accordance with the D. melanogaster Cyp12s. The characterization and evolutionary analysis of P450s from B. mori in the current study provide useful information for understanding the characteristics and diversity of P450s from B. mori and the baseline for functional analyses of individual P450s in this model Lepidopteran insect.",2011,"Junwen Ai, Yong Zhu, Jun Duan, Quanyou Yu, Gaojun Zhang, Fei Wan, Zhong-huai Xiang, Junwen Ai, Yong Zhu, Jun Duan, Quanyou Yu, Gaojun Zhang, Fei Wan, Zhong-huai Xiang"
Evolution acts on enhancer organization to fine-tune gradient threshold readouts,18986212,10.1371/journal.pbio.0060263,"The elucidation of principles governing evolution of gene regulatory sequence is critical to the study of metazoan diversification. We are therefore exploring the structure and organizational constraints of regulatory sequences by studying functionally equivalent cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that have been evolving in parallel across several loci. Such an independent dataset allows a multi-locus study that is not hampered by nonfunctional or constrained homology. The neurogenic ectoderm enhancers (NEEs) of Drosophila melanogaster are one such class of coordinately regulated CRMs. The NEEs share a common organization of binding sites and as a set would be useful to study the relationship between CRM organization and CRM activity across evolving lineages. We used the D. melanogaster transgenic system to screen for functional adaptations in the NEEs from divergent drosophilid species. We show that the individual NEE modules across a genome in any one lineage have independently evolved adaptations to compensate for lineage-specific developmental and/or genomic changes. Specifically, we show that both the site composition and the site organization of NEEs have been finely tuned by distinct, lineage-specific selection pressures in each of the three divergent species that we have examined: D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. Furthermore, by precisely altering the organization of NEEs with different morphogen gradient threshold readouts, we show that CRM organizational evolution is sufficient for explaining changes in enhancer activity. Thus, evolution can act on CRM organization to fine-tune morphogen gradient threshold readouts over a wide dynamic range. Our study demonstrates that equivalence classes of CRMs are powerful tools for detecting lineage-specific adaptations by gene regulatory sequences.",2008,"Justin Crocker, Yoichiro Tamori, Albert Erives, Justin Crocker, Yoichiro Tamori, Albert Erives"

D. melanogaster proteins were then denatured by boiling in SDS plus DTT, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography and SDS-PAGE purification. As anticipated, we found that a CNBr fragment derived from the N-terminal part of lamin Dm0-derivatives (amino acid residues 2-158; fragment A) was phosphorylated during both interphase and mitosis. Interphase but not mitotic phosphorylation was found on an internal CNBr fragment (derived from the end of the central rod domain and the first part of the C-terminal lamin tail; amino acid residues 385-548; fragment D). Interphase only phosphorylation was also detected on another CNBr fragment derived from the extreme C-terminal portion of lamin Dm0-derivatives (amino acid residues 549-622; fragment E). To supplement these data, we used 2-D tryptic peptide mapping followed by phosphorImager analysis. We routinely detected at least seven 'spots' derived from interphase lamins but only a single mitotic lamin phosphopeptide.",2002,"Ryszard Rzepecki, Paul A Fisher, Ryszard Rzepecki, Paul A Fisher"
"The nucleotide sequence of a microvitellogenin encoding gene from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta",2583514,10.1016/0378-1119(89)90290-4,"A microvitellogenin (mVg)-coding gene (mvg) has been isolated from a lambda phage library prepared from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. One of the lambda clones had a 15-kb insert and contained the entire mvg gene. A DNA fragment (3.0 kb) containing this mvg gene has been sequenced. Southern blot analysis showed that there may be more than one mvg gene in M. sexta. The putative transcriptional start point (tsp) for the cloned mvg was determined by primer extension analysis. This gene contains a single intron in the 5'-noncoding region. The 5'-flanking sequence was compared to the 5'-conserved regions of yolk polypeptide-encoding genes (yp) of Drosophila melanogaster. Two regions were found in the 5'-flanking sequence of the mvg gene that have 66% similarity to the D. melanogaster yp consensus sequence that is believed to be involved in gene expression controlled by ecdysteroids. Furthermore, the sequences flanking these two regions are also similar to the ecdysone-responsive elements found in several genes of D. melanogaster. In fact, preliminary experiments showed that mVg mRNA synthesis is induced by the 20-hydroxyecdysone. Four regions of the mvg gene resemble the upstream conserved regions of the two vitellogenin-encoding genes of the locust, Locusta migratoria. The nucleotide sequence of mvg has 70% similarity to the sequence of one or more of the 30-kDa hemolymph proteins of Bombyx mori. This indicates a very close evolutionary relationship between these proteins.",1989,"X Y Wang, K D Cole, J H Law, X Y Wang, K D Cole, J H Law"
Characterization of Toxin Complex Gene Clusters and Insect Toxicity of Bacteria Representing Four Subgroups of Pseudomonas fluorescens,27580176,10.1371/journal.pone.0161120,"Ten strains representing four lineages of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group (P. chlororaphis, P. corrugata, P. koreensis, and P. fluorescens subgroups) were evaluated for toxicity to the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta and the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The three strains within the P. chlororaphis subgroup exhibited both oral and injectable toxicity to the lepidopteran M. sexta. All three strains have the gene cluster encoding the FitD insect toxin and a ?fitD mutant of P. protegens strain Pf-5 exhibited diminished oral toxicity compared to the wildtype strain. Only one of the three strains, P. protegens Pf-5, exhibited substantial levels of oral toxicity against the dipteran D. melanogaster. Three strains in the P. fluorescens subgroup, which lack fitD, consistently showed significant levels of injectable toxicity against M. sexta. In contrast, the oral toxicity of these strains against D. melanogaster was variable between experiments, with only one strain, Pseudomonas sp. BG33R, causing significant levels of mortality in repeated experiments. Toxin complex (Tc) gene clusters, which encode insecticidal properties in Photorhabdus luminescens, were identified in the genomes of seven of the ten strains evaluated in this study. Within those seven genomes, six types of Tc gene clusters were identified, distinguished by gene content, organization and genomic location, but no correlation was observed between the presence of Tc genes and insect toxicity of the evaluated strains. Our results demonstrate that members of the P. fluorescens group have the capacity to kill insects by both FitD-dependent and independent mechanisms.",2016,"Lorena I Rangel, Marcella D Henkels, Brenda T Shaffer, Francesca L Walker, Edward W Davis 2nd, Virginia O Stockwell, Denny Bruck, Barbara J Taylor, Joyce E Loper, Lorena I Rangel, Marcella D Henkels, Brenda T Shaffer, Francesca L Walker, Edward W Davis 2nd, Virginia O Stockwell, Denny Bruck, Barbara J Taylor, Joyce E Loper"
Mechanisms of apoptosis in Crustacea: What conditions induce versus suppress cell death?,20043212,10.1007/s10495-009-0443-6,"Arthropoda is the largest of all animal phyla and includes about 90% of extant species. Our knowledge about regulation of apoptosis in this phylum is largely based on findings for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Recent work with crustaceans shows that apoptotic proteins, and presumably mechanisms of cell death regulation, are more diverse in arthropods than appreciated based solely on the excellent work with fruit flies. Crustacean homologs exist for many major proteins in the apoptotic networks of mammals and D. melanogaster, but integration of these proteins into the physiology and pathophysiology of crustaceans is far from complete. Whether apoptosis in crustaceans is mainly transcriptionally regulated as in D. melanogaster (e.g., RHG 'killer' proteins), or rather is controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins as in vertebrates needs to be clarified. Some phenomena like the calcium-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) are apparently lacking in crustaceans and may represent a vertebrate invention. We speculate that differences in regulation of the intrinsic pathway of crustacean apoptosis might represent a prerequisite for some species to survive harsh environmental insults. Pro-apoptotic stimuli described for crustaceans include UV radiation, environmental toxins, and a diatom-produced chemical that promotes apoptosis in offspring of a copepod. Mechanisms that serve to depress apoptosis include the inhibition of caspase activity by high potassium in energetically healthy cells, alterations in nucleotide abundance during energy-limited states like diapause and anoxia, resistance to opening of the calcium-induced MPTP, and viral accommodation during persistent viral infection. Characterization of the players, pathways, and their significance in the core machinery of crustacean apoptosis is revealing new insights for the field of cell death.",2010,"Michael A Menze, Grady Fortner, Suman Nag, Steven C Hand, Michael A Menze, Grady Fortner, Suman Nag, Steven C Hand"
The archaeal cofactor F0 is a light-harvesting antenna chromophore in eukaryotes,19570997,10.1073/pnas.0812665106,"Archae possess unique biochemical systems quite distinct from the pathways present in eukaryotes and eubacteria. 7,8-Dimethyl-8-hydroxy-5deazaflavin (F(0)) and F(420) are unique deazaflavin-containing coenzyme and methanogenic signature molecules, essential for a variety of biochemical transformations associated with methane biosynthesis and light-dependent DNA repair. The deazaflavin cofactor system functions during methane biosynthesis as a low-potential hydrid shuttle F(420)/F(420)H(2). In DNA photolyase repair proteins, the deazaflavin cofactor is in the deprotonated state active as a light-collecting energy transfer pigment. As such, it converts blue sunlight into energy used by the proteins to drive an essential repair process. Analysis of a eukaryotic (6-4) DNA photolyase from Drosophila melanogaster revealed a binding pocket, which tightly binds F(0). Residues in the pocket activate the cofactor by deprotonation so that light absorption and energy transfer are switched on. The crystal structure of F(0) in complex with the D. melanogaster protein shows the atomic details of F(0) binding and activation, allowing characterization of the residues involved in F(0) activation. The results show that the F(0)/F(420) coenzyme system, so far believed to be strictly limited to the archael kingdom of life, is far more widespread than anticipated. Analysis of a D. melanogaster extract and of a DNA photolyase from the primitive eukaryote Ostreococcus tauri provided direct proof for the presence of the F(0) cofactor also in higher eukaryotes.",2009,"Andreas F Glas, Melanie J Maul, Max Cryle, Thomas R M Barends, Sabine Schneider, Emine Kaya, Ilme Schlichting, Thomas Carell, Andreas F Glas, Melanie J Maul, Max Cryle, Thomas R M Barends, Sabine Schneider, Emine Kaya, Ilme Schlichting, Thomas Carell"
"Ecdysteroid titers and developmental expression of ecdysteroid-regulated genes during metamorphosis of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)",16580015,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2006.02.003,"Ecdysteroid titers and expression profiles of ecdysone-regulated genes were determined during the last instar larval and during the pupal stages of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Three peaks of ecdysteroids occurring at approximately 24, 30-33 and 45-48h after ecdysis to the fourth instar larval stage were detected. In the pupa, a large peak of ecdysteroids occurred between 6 and 12h after ecdysis to the pupal stage. A small rise in ecdysteroids was also detected at the end of the pupal stage. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses of the expression of ecdysone receptors and ecdysone-regulated genes showed that the peaks of expression of most of these genes coincided with the rise in ecdysteroid levels during the last larval and pupal stages. In the last larval stage, ecdysteroid titers and mRNA expression profiles of ecdysone-regulated genes are similar to those observed for Drosophila melanogaster. However, in the early pupal stage, both ecdysteroid titers and the expression of ecdysone-regulated genes are somewhat different from those observed in D. melanogaster, probably because the duration of the pupal stage in D. melanogaster is 84h while in Ae. aeqypti the duration is only 48h. These data which describe the relationship between ecdysteroid titers and mRNA levels of Ae. aegypti ecdysteroid-regulated genes lay a solid foundation for future studies on the hormonal regulation of development in mosquitoes.",2006,"Venu M Margam, Dale B Gelman, Subba R Palli, Venu M Margam, Dale B Gelman, Subba R Palli"
Cloning and characterization of the white and topaz eye color genes from the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina,1971656,10.1007/BF02101889,"Clones carrying the white and topaz eye color genes have been isolated from genomic DNA libraries of the blowfly Lucilia cuprina using cloned DNA from the homologous white and scarlet genes, respectively, of Drosophila melanogaster as probes. On the basis of hybridization studies using adjacent restriction fragments, homologous fragments were found to be colinear between the genes from the two species. The nucleotide sequence of a short region of the white gene of L. cuprina has been determined, and the homology to the corresponding region of D. melanogaster is 72%; at the derived amino acid level the homology is greater (84%) due to a marked difference in codon usage between the species. A major difference in genome organization between the two species is that whereas the DNA encompassing the D. melanogaster genes is free of repeated sequences, that encompassing their L. cuprina counterparts contains substantial amounts of repeated sequences. This suggests that the genome of L. cuprina is organized on the short period interspersion pattern. Repeated sequence DNA elements, which appear generally to be short (less than 1 kb) and which vary in repetitive frequency in the genome from greater than 10(4) copies to less than 10(2) copies, are found in at least two different locations in the clones carrying these genes. One type of repeat structure, found by sequencing, consists of tandemly repeating short sequences. Restriction site and restriction fragment length polymorphisms involving both the white and topaz gene regions are found within and between populations of L. cuprina.",1990,"A Elizur, A T Vacek, A J Howells, A Elizur, A T Vacek, A J Howells"
"Drosophila nonsense suppressors: functional analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila tissue culture cells and Drosophila melanogaster",2174393,,"Amber (UAG) and opal (UGA) nonsense suppressors were constructed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of two Drosophila melanogaster leucine-tRNA genes and tested in yeast, Drosophila tissue culture cells and transformed flies. Suppression of a variety of amber and opal alleles occurs in yeast.

The mutant tRNAs were also introduced into the Drosophila genome by P element-mediated transformation. No measurable suppression was seen in histochemical assays for Adhn4 (amber), AdhnB (opal), or an amber allele of beta-galactosidase. Low levels of suppression (approximately 0.1-0.5% of wild type) were detected using an hsp70:cat (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) amber mutation.

Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes of Drosophila melanogaster,6184715,10.1073/pnas.79.22.6762,"We report here on the isolation and characterization of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and corresponding small nuclear RNA (snRNA) species from nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster. Velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients was used to partially fractionate the RNPs; analysis of fractions so obtained suggests that, in general, one snRNP contains one snRNA. At least 11 species of snRNA are present in Drosophila nuclei; among them we identify a potential mammalian U1 homolog based on sequence homology. Autoimmune antiserum designated anti-Sm from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus recognizes nuclear antigens in Drosophila and precipitates seven species of snRNPs. The antigens in HeLa and Drosophila nuclei recognized by anti-Sm antibodies have been identified and compared. Anti-Sm antibodies at least bind to a 26,000-dalton polypeptide in HeLa extracts and to two polypeptides, one of 18,000 daltons and one of 26,000 daltons, in Drosophila extracts.

Interspecific comparison of a Drosophila gene encoding FMRFamide-related neuropeptides,2113087,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.10-06-01929.1990,"In order to identify functionally important regions of a neuropeptide gene in Drosophila melanogaster, we have studied its occurrence in related species and have characterized the structure of a homologous gene in Drosophila virilis. The melanogaster gene encodes a precursor that contains 13 neuropeptides related to the molluscan tetrapeptide FMRFamide (Nambu et al., 1988; Schneider and Taghert, 1988). Using the melanogaster gene as a probe in Southern blot analysis, related sequences were detected in DNA from each of 7 species tested. D. virilis, which is estimated to have diverged from D. melanogaster between 60 and 80 million years ago (Throckmorton, 1975), was chosen for more detailed study. Immunocytochemical staining using an antibody to authentic FMRFamide revealed a similar set of immunoreactive neurons in the CNS of larvae from the 2 Drosophila species. Using a melanogaster gene probe, overlapping clones were isolated from a virilis genomic library; DNA sequence analysis indicated the presence of a homologous gene. Comparisons of the genes and deduced proteins between the 2 species revealed the following points. (1) Both genes are divided into 2 exons: in D. melanogaster the exons are 106 and 1352 bp long; in D. virilis, they are 169 and at least 1232 bp long; in both species, the intron is approximately 2.5 kb long. (2) The sequence of exon I has largely diverged, and in neither species are exon I sequences translated. In this vicinity of the gene, sequence conservation is limited to a 67 bp region that spans the TATA box and the RNA start site. (3) The deduced neuropeptide precursors have very similar sizes (347 vs 339 amino acids) and the presumed signal sequences are perfectly conserved. (4) While the melanogaster precursor contains 13 FMRFamide-related peptides, the virilis precursor contains only 10. (5) The sequences of some but not all of the FMRFamide-like peptides are perfectly conserved. (6) In the rest of the precursor, significant sequence conservation is found only in the N-terminal portion; immediately downstream of the final FMRFamide-like peptide, the protein sequences are highly divergent. (7) 5' to the RNA start sites (1.2 kb of melanogaster DNA and 1.8 kb of virilis DNA), 17 small (9-52 base pairs) regions are evolutionarily conserved (greater than 80% sequence conservation). We discuss neuropeptide biosynthesis, the functions and evolution of FMRFamide-like neuropeptides in insects, and the cell-specific regulation of neuropeptide gene expression in the contexts of these results.",1990,"P H Taghert, L E Schneider, P H Taghert, L E Schneider"

Larval ethanol exposure alters adult circadian free-running locomotor activity rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster,22217104,10.3109/07420528.2011.635236,"Alcohol consumption causes disruptions in a variety of daily rhythms, including the sleep-wake cycle. Few studies have explored the effect of alcohol exposure only during developmental stages preceding maturation of the adult circadian clock, and none have examined the effects of alcohol on clock function in Drosophila. This study investigates developmental and behavioral correlates between larval ethanol exposure and the adult circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster, a well-established model for studying circadian rhythms and effects of ethanol exposure. We reared Drosophila larvae on 0%, 10%, or 20% ethanol-supplemented food and assessed effects upon eclosion and the free-running period of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity. We observed a dose-dependent effect of ethanol on period, with higher doses resulting in shorter periods. We also identified the third larval instar stage as a critical time for the developmental effects of 10% ethanol on circadian period. These results demonstrate that developmental ethanol exposure causes sustainable shortening of the adult free-running period in Drosophila melanogaster, even after adult exposure to ethanol is terminated, and suggests that the third instar is a sensitive time for this effect.",2012,"Joseph A Seggio, Bernard Possidente, S Tariq Ahmad, Joseph A Seggio, Bernard Possidente, S Tariq Ahmad"
Knockdown of ATPsyn-b caused larval growth defect and male infertility in Drosophila,25336344,10.1002/arch.21209,"The ATPsyn-b encoding for subunit b of ATP synthase in Drosophila melanogaster is proposed to act in ATP synthesis and phagocytosis, and has been identified as one of the sperm proteins in both Drosophila and mammals. At present, its details of functions in animal growth and spermatogenesis have not been reported. In this study, we knocked down ATPsyn-b using Drosophila lines expressing inducible hairpin RNAi constructs and Gal4 drivers. Ubiquitous knockdown of ATPsyn-b resulted in growth defects in larval stage as the larvae did not grow bigger than the size of normal second-instar larvae. Knockdown in testes did not interrupt the developmental excursion to viable adult flies, however, these male adults were sterile. Analyses of testes revealed disrupted nuclear bundles during spermatogenesis and abnormal shaping in spermatid elongation. There were no mature sperm in the seminal vesicle of ATPsyn-b knockdown male testes. These findings suggest us that ATPsyn-b acts in growth and male fertility of Drosophila.",2015,"Ya-Na Chen, Chun-Hong Wu, Ya Zheng, Jing-Jing Li, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang, Ya-Na Chen, Chun-Hong Wu, Ya Zheng, Jing-Jing Li, Jia-Lin Wang, Yu-Feng Wang"
Integration of Drosophila heat-shock genes transfected into cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells,6438809,10.1007/BF01535223,"We have used DNA-mediated gene transfer to introduce into Drosophila melanogaster cells DNA sequences for which no selective criteria exist. We have introduced a Drosophila heat-shock locus into cultured Drosophila cells by calcium phosphate cotransfection with the copia vector pCV31gpt and selection for xanthine utilization. We recovered cell lines containing between three and about 50 copies of both pCV31gpt and pMH10A, a cloned 87 A7 hsp70 heat-shock locus that encodes a mutant 40,000-dalton heat-shock protein (hsp40). The stable inheritance of the transformed DNAs argues that the input DNAs have integrated into the genome. We show that this is indeed the case for one cell line by cloning back the transfected DNA and detecting the flanking chromocentral sequences by in situ hybridization. Surprisingly, the integrated hsp70 genes are not expressed. This report represents the first example of the cointroduction of DNA sequences into Drosophila cells by cotransfection with a dominant selectable marker.",1984,"J F Burke, S M Pinchin, D Ish-Horowicz, J H Sinclair, J H Sang, J F Burke, S M Pinchin, D Ish-Horowicz, J H Sinclair, J H Sang"
Using optogenetics to assess neuroendocrine modulation of heart rate in Drosophila melanogaster larvae,28612236,10.1007/s00359-017-1191-7,"The Drosophila melanogaster heart has become a principal model in which to study cardiac physiology and development. While the morphology of the heart in Drosophila and mammals is different, many of the molecular mechanisms that underlie heart development and function are similar and function can be assessed by similar physiological measurements, such as cardiac output, rate, and time in systole or diastole. Here, we have utilized an intact, optogenetic approach to assess the neural influence on heart rate in the third instar larvae. To simulate the release of modulators from the nervous system in response to environmental influences, we have directed expression of channel-rhodopsin variants to targeted neuronal populations to assess the role of these neural ensembles in directing release of modulators that may affect heart rate in vivo. Our observations show that the activation of targeted neurons, including cholinergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurons, stimulate the release of cardioactive substances that increase heart rate after the initial activation at both room temperature and in a cold environment. This parallels previous studies suggesting these modulators play a crucial role in altering heart rate when applied to exposed hearts and adds to our understanding of chemical modulation of heart rate in intact Drosophila larvae.",2017,"Cole Malloy, Jacob Sifers, Angela Mikos, Aya Samadi, Aya Omar, Christina Hermanns, Robin L Cooper, Cole Malloy, Jacob Sifers, Angela Mikos, Aya Samadi, Aya Omar, Christina Hermanns, Robin L Cooper"
Metabolomics with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in a Drosophila melanogaster Model of Surviving Sepsis,28009836,10.3390/metabo6040047,"Patients surviving sepsis demonstrate sustained inflammation, which has been associated with long-term complications. One of the main mechanisms behind sustained inflammation is a metabolic switch in parenchymal and immune cells, thus understanding metabolic alterations after sepsis may provide important insights to the pathophysiology of sepsis recovery. In this study, we explored metabolomics in a novel Drosophila melanogaster model of surviving sepsis using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), to determine metabolite profiles. We used a model of percutaneous infection in Drosophila melanogaster to mimic sepsis. We had three experimental groups: sepsis survivors (infected with Staphylococcus aureus and treated with oral linezolid), sham (pricked with an aseptic needle), and unmanipulated (positive control). We performed metabolic measurements seven days after sepsis. We then implemented metabolites detected in NMR spectra into the MetExplore web server in order to identify the metabolic pathway alterations in sepsis surviving Drosophila. Our NMR metabolomic approach in a Drosophila model of recovery from sepsis clearly distinguished between all three groups and showed two different metabolomic signatures of inflammation. Sham flies had decreased levels of maltose, alanine, and glutamine, while their level of choline was increased. Sepsis survivors had a metabolic signature characterized by decreased glucose, maltose, tyrosine, beta-alanine, acetate, glutamine, and succinate.",2016,"Veli Bakalov, Roland Amathieu, Mohamed N Triba, Marie-Jeanne Clément, Laura Reyes Uribe, Laurence Le Moyec, Ata Murat Kaynar, Veli Bakalov, Roland Amathieu, Mohamed N Triba, Marie-Jeanne Clément, Laura Reyes Uribe, Laurence Le Moyec, Ata Murat Kaynar"
Extensive diversity among Drosophila species with respect to nucleotide sequences within the adenine + thymine-rich region of mitochondrial DNA molecules,6255406,10.1093/nar/8.11.2439,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules from species of the genus Drosophila contain a region exceptionally rich in adenine + thymine (A+T). Using agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy, we determined that in the mtDNA molecules of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, D. takahashii, and D. virilis, the A+T-rich regions, which are 5.1, 4.8, 4.6, 1.1, 2.2, and 1.0 kilobase pairs in size, respectively, are at homologous locations relative to various common EcoRI and HindIII cleavage sites. Under conditions highly permissive for base pairing (35% formamide), heteroduplexes were constructed between EcoRI fragments and whole circular molecules of mtDNAs of the above mentioned six species in a variety of combinations. Complete pairing of molecules outside the A+T-rich region was found in all heteroduplexes examined. However, in contrast, A+T-rich regions of the different species failed to pair in all but those combinations of mtDNAs involving the three most closely related species. In heteroduplexes between D. melanogaster and D. simulans, and between D. melanogaster and D. mauritiana mtDNAs, up to 35% of the A+T-rich regions appeared double-stranded. These data indicate that much more extensive divergence of sequences has occurred in A+T-rich regions than in other regions of Drosophila mtDNA molecules.",1980,"C M Fauron, D R Wolstenholme, C M Fauron, D R Wolstenholme"

Specific dietary carbohydrates differentially influence the life span and fecundity of Drosophila melanogaster,23723431,10.1093/gerona/glt077,"The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster is a broadly used model for gerontological research. Many studies are dedicated to understanding nutritional effects on ageing; however, the influence of dietary carbohydrate type and dosage is still poorly understood. We show that among three carbohydrates tested, fructose, glucose, and sucrose, the latter decreased life span by 13%-27%, being present in concentrations of 2%-20% in the diet. Life-span shortening by sucrose was accompanied by an increase in age-independent mortality. Sucrose also dramatically decreased the fecundity of the flies. The differences in life span and fecundity were determined to be unrelated to differential carbohydrate ingestion. The highest mitochondrial protein density was observed in flies fed sucrose-containing diet. However, this parameter was not affected by carbohydrate amount in the diet. Fly sensitivity to oxidative stress, induced by menadione, was increased in aged flies and was slightly affected by type and concentration of carbohydrate. In general, it has been demonstrated that sucrose, commonly used in recipes of Drosophila laboratory food, may shorten life span and lower egg-laying capability on the diets with very low protein content.",2014,"Oleh V Lushchak, Dmytro V Gospodaryov, Bohdana M Rovenko, Ihor S Yurkevych, Natalia V Perkhulyn, Volodymyr I Lushchak, Oleh V Lushchak, Dmytro V Gospodaryov, Bohdana M Rovenko, Ihor S Yurkevych, Natalia V Perkhulyn, Volodymyr I Lushchak"
Anent the genomics of spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster,23409089,10.1371/journal.pone.0055915,"An appreciable fraction of the Drosophila melanogaster genome is dedicated to male fertility. One approach to characterizing this subset of the genome is through the study of male-sterile mutations. We studied the relation between vital and male-fertility genes in three large autosomal regions that were saturated for lethal and male-sterile mutations. The majority of male-sterile mutations affect genes that are exclusively expressed in males. These genes are required only for male fertility, and several mutant alleles of each such gene were encountered. A few male-sterile mutations were alleles of vital genes that are expressed in both males and females. About one-fifth of the genes in Drosophila melanogaster show male-specific expression in adults. Although some earlier studies found a paucity of genes on the X chromosome showing male-biased expression, we did not find any significant differences between the X chromosome and the autosomes either in the relative frequencies of mutations to male sterility or in the frequencies of genes with male-specific expression in adults. Our results suggest that as much as 25% of the Drosophila genome may be dedicated to male fertility.",2013,"Dan L Lindsley, John Roote, James A Kennison, Dan L Lindsley, John Roote, James A Kennison"
Identification of insulin-induced sites of ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in Drosophila melanogaster,10801327,10.1021/bi9927484,"Insulin treatment of Drosophila melanogaster Kc 167 cells induces the multiple phosphorylation of a Drosophila ribosomal protein, as judged by its decreased electrophoretic mobility on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. The extent to which insulin induces this response is potentiated by cycloheximide and blocked by pretreatment with rapamycin. Isolation and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the multiply phosphorylated protein was the larger of two Drosophila melanogaster orthologues of mammalian 40S ribosomal protein S6, termed here DS6A. Proteolytic cleavage of DS6A derived from stimulated Kc 167 cells with the endoproteinase Lys-C released a number of peptides, one of which contained all the putative phosphorylation sites. Conversion of phosphoserines to dehydroalanines with Ba(OH)(2) showed that the sites of phosphorylation reside at the carboxy terminus of DS6A. The sites of phosphorylation were identified by Edman degradation after conversion of the phosphoserine residues to S-ethylcysteine as Ser(233), Ser(235), Ser(239), Ser(242), and Ser(245). Finally, phosphopeptide mapping of individual phosphoderivatives, isolated from two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, indicated that DS6A phosphorylation, in analogy to mammalian S6 phosphorylation, appears to proceed in an ordered fashion. The importance of these observations in cell growth and development is discussed.",2000,"T Radimerski, T Mini, U Schneider, R E Wettenhall, G Thomas, P Jenö, T Radimerski, T Mini, U Schneider, R E Wettenhall, G Thomas, P Jenö"
RESPONSES AND CORRELATED RESPONSES TO ARTIFICIAL SELECTION ON THORAX LENGTH IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER,28568094,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1993.tb01211.x,"Two sets of four replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for large and small thorax with controls. F, progeny of crosses between the selected lines within each size category showed (a) a reduction in preadult viability in large lines relative to control and small lines when they were cultured at medium or high density in competition with a standard mutant marked competitor stock, and (b) an increase in larval development time in large lines relative to control and small lines. Natural selection for increased body size in adults may therefore be opposed by adverse effects on larval viability. The results are discussed in terms of the developmental mechanisms probably responsible for the change in body size. The preadult survival of the large and control lines was measured at three different temperatures, and there was no evidence for a significant interaction between size and temperature. The observed evolutionary increase in body size in response to reduced temperature in Drosophila must therefore involve either different genes from those subject to selection for size at a single temperature, or a fitness component other than preadult survival. There was no significant asymmetry in response to selection, and thorax length showed heterosis in crosses between the selected lines.",1993,"Linda Partridge, Kevin Fowler, Linda Partridge, Kevin Fowler"
Rapid screening of potential human bladder carcinogens: genotoxicity in meiosis repair deficient Drosophila melanogaster,2509735,10.1016/s0022-5347(17)39097-3,"To find a quick screen of potential bladder carcinogens, a genotoxicity test in Drosophila melanogaster stocks containing DNA repair mutations was evaluated. Meiosis repair deficient male Drosophila melanogaster mei-9, mei-41, and the double mutant mei-9-41 were allowed to mate with attached -x females on media containing the test agent. Genotoxic agents produce DNA damage which accumulates and can be lethal in mei males, whereas the attached -x females are able to repair the damage and survive. Thus, the sex ratio of the progeny is a measure of genotoxicity which can be correlated with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, tea, coffee, and saccharin were not genotoxic (p greater than 0.3). Dose dependent toxicity was observed in bracken fern (p less than 0.001). The known mutagen and bladder carcinogen, cyclophosphamide, was highly genotoxic (p less than .001).

The enzymes were also separated by DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography and distinguished by their different rates of thermal inactivation. The multiple forms are termed formamidase I and formamidase II. The molecular weight of formamidase I as measured by Sephadex G-75 chromatography is 60 000 and that of formamidase II is 31 000. The pH optima are broad, ranging between 6.7 and 7.8 for formamidase I and 6.5 and 8.0 for formamidase II. The apparent Km values are 5-10(-3) and 0.83-10(-3) M, resepctively. The possibility that formamidase II is an active subunit of formamidase I is discussed, although neither enzyme will convert to the other when separated and rechromatographed.

Investigating Alcohol Behavior and Physiology Using Drosophila melanogaster,32219744,10.1007/978-1-0716-0471-7_7,"Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, is one of the most versatile models for biomedical studies due to the economical husbandry, rapid generation time, and the array of tools for spatial and temporal gene manipulation. The relatively short lifespan of Drosophila (60-80 days) and the high degree of molecular conservation across species make Drosophila ideal to study the complexities of aging. Alcohol is the most abused drug worldwide and alcohol use disorders represent a significant public health problem and economic burden to individuals and society. Stereotypical alcohol-induced behaviors and the underlying molecular mechanisms are conserved from flies to humans making Drosophila a practical model for investigating the development of alcohol-induced behaviors and alcohol pathologies.

Kinetic characterization of dihydrofolate reductase from Drosophila melanogaster,2124130,10.1139/o90-161,"The kinetic characteristics of a purified insect dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) have been described. The Km values for the substrate dihydrofolate and the cofactor NADPH have been estimated by primary and secondary Hanes plots to be 0.3 and 5.2 microM, respectively. Drosophila melanogaster DHFR can use folate and NADH at acidic pH values, but at a much lower rate than the preferred substrate and cofactor. Folic acid is a partial competitive inhibitor of Drosophila DHFR (Ki = 0.4 microM) and trimethoprim is a complete competitive inhibitor (Ki = 5.4 microM). Methotrexate binds less tightly to the Drosophila enzyme than to many other DHFRs (Kd = 0.9 nM). Drosophila DHFR is inhibited by KCl and organic mercurials and is slightly activated by urea. These data indicate that Drosophila DHFR has some characteristics which are typical of vertebrate DHFRs and others which are typical of prokaryotic DHFRs. The study of this enzyme, therefore, should aid in the definition of the structural features that are responsible for the kinetic characteristics in different DHFRs.",1990,"S L Rancourt, V K Walker, S L Rancourt, V K Walker"
Cholera toxin and pertussis toxin substrates and endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in Drosophila melanogaster,3135838,10.1016/0167-4889(88)90135-8,"Cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation were used to identify and localize G protein substrates in Drosophila melanogaster and in Manduca sexta. Cholera toxin catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of 37 kDa and 50 kDa polypeptides, but these polypeptides are also substrates for an ADP-ribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.30) activity endogenous to the Drosophila extracts. Pertussis toxin modifies 37 kDa and 39 kDa polypeptides in Drosophila homogenates. The pattern of proteolysis of the 39 kDa pertussis toxin substrate is similar to that of mammalian Go and is influenced by guanyl nucleotide binding. The 39 kDa Go-like Drosophila and Manduca pertussis toxin substrates are found primarily in neural tissues. These studies provide further evidence that G proteins are present in Drosophila and that this organism can therefore be used to investigate the physiological roles of these enzymes using advanced genetic manipulations.",1988,"R S Hopkins, M A Stamnes, M I Simon, J B Hurley, R S Hopkins, M A Stamnes, M I Simon, J B Hurley"

Drosophila melanogaster as a model for lead neurotoxicology and toxicogenomics research,22586431,10.3389/fgene.2012.00068,"Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model animal for studying the neurotoxicology of lead. It has been known since ancient Roman times that long-term exposure to low levels of lead results in behavioral abnormalities, such as what is now known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because lead alters mechanisms that underlie developmental neuronal plasticity, chronic exposure of children, even at blood lead levels below the current CDC community action level (10 μg/dl), can result in reduced cognitive ability, increased likelihood of delinquency, behaviors associated with ADHD, changes in activity level, altered sensory function, delayed onset of sexual maturity in girls, and changes in immune function. In order to better understand how lead affects neuronal plasticity, we will describe recent findings from a Drosophila behavioral genetics laboratory, a Drosophila neurophysiology laboratory, and a Drosophila quantitative genetics laboratory who have joined forces to study the effects of lead on the Drosophila nervous system. Studying the effects of lead on Drosophila nervous system development will give us a better understanding of the mechanisms of Pb neurotoxicity in the developing human nervous system.",2012,"Helmut V B Hirsch, Gregory Lnenicka, Debra Possidente, Bernard Possidente, Mark D Garfinkel, Luan Wang, Xiangyi Lu, Douglas M Ruden, Helmut V B Hirsch, Gregory Lnenicka, Debra Possidente, Bernard Possidente, Mark D Garfinkel, Luan Wang, Xiangyi Lu, Douglas M Ruden"
